1
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:05,025
l am merely a businessman.

2
00:00:05,062 --> 00:00:06,620
lt would take an orator

3
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:09,929
with the skills of the late,
great Plegg himself

4
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:12,993
to sing the praises
of the late, great Plegg.

5
00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:15,904
What Ferengi could resist
the honor of owning

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,171
a small piece of the man
that took a computer chip

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,441
and turned it into
the modular holosuite industry?

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,038
A small piece of the man

9
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:26,515
that brought
holographic entertainment

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,110
to the most remote parts
of the Quadrant

11
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:30,711
creating profit centers

12
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:34,987
from societies that could barely
afford to feed their own people.

13
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:36,549
How much are you asking?

14
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:39,927
As l was about to tell
my good friend here

15
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:42,489
a mere three strips of latinum.

16
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:44,694
And l'd be taking
a loss at that price.

17
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:50,167
Okay, for you, two strips.

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,135
Thank you very much.

19
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:56,612
Three strips?

20
00:00:56,647 --> 00:00:58,444
That's a fair price for Plegg.

21
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:00,040
l suppose you're interested?

22
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:02,678
Humanoid death rituals
are an interest of mine.

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,812
Death rituals.

24
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:05,412
Everybody needs a hobby.

25
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:06,548
Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,524
Some species burn their dead

27
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:10,789
others pack them
in blocks of ice.

28
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:12,819
Some even surround themselves

29
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:15,127
with the company
of family corpses.

30
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:19,159
But the Ferengi ritual
of chopping up their loved ones

31
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:21,636
and selling them...

32
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:24,869
l find that irresistible.

33
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:26,570
l'm very busy here.

34
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,669
What a fitting
and distinguished way

35
00:01:28,712 --> 00:01:31,442
to honor the memory
of great Ferengi entrepreneurs.

36
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:34,110
l'm thinking of starting
a collection

37
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:36,984
putting up a display case
in my office.

38
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,888
There'll be a special
space in there

39
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:42,290
reserved just for you, Quark.

40
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,556
l'm sure.

41
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:53,566
You're serious?

42
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:56,198
Have you ever known me
not to be?

43
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:06,138
There is one thing
l was curious about.

44
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:07,411
And what's that?

45
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:09,043
How do l know it's Plegg?

46
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:10,678
lt says so on the label.

47
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:13,884
lsn't there some
sort of letter of authenticity?

48
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:17,155
The Ferengi Seal
of Dismemberment is right here.

49
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:18,819
What more do you want?

50
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:19,830
l want Plegg.

51
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:20,831
You got him!

52
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:22,457
Not if he's still alive.

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,694
Still alive?

54
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:27,328
Still alive.

55
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:28,497
Plegg?

56
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:31,269
After l tracked him
down on Kholfa ll

57
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:33,401
told him
about your little scheme

58
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,775
he was quite amused.

59
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:36,279
l'm not.

60
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:38,110
Odo, l'm a victim here.

61
00:02:38,148 --> 00:02:40,878
l bought these discs
in good faith.

62
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:44,410
l have 5,000 pieces of Plegg
in my storeroom.

63
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,047
Uh-uh-uh, not Plegg.

64
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,182
Then who?

65
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,851
Good question.

66
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:52,124
l demand an investigation.

67
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:54,653
You'll get one, l promise you.

68
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:56,689
Odo!

69
00:02:58,736 --> 00:03:00,533
Dr. Mora.

70
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:05,642
lt's been too long.

71
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:07,507
You're looking well.

72
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:10,446
Yes...

73
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,779
coming along nicely.

74
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:17,679
Why didn't you let me know
that you were coming?

75
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:19,814
lt was a last-minute
arrangement.

76
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:23,156
Uh-huh. The trip from Bajor
takes five hours.

77
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,559
Can l get you something...
Dr., uh, Mora, was it?

78
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:30,795
Yes, some, uh, Deka tea
would be nice.

79
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:39,833
Haven't quite managed
the ears yet, have you?

80
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:41,538
Oh, no, but they're...

81
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:42,944
they're difficult.

82
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,777
ls the suit a suit,
or part of you?

83
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,339
Oh, and what about the boots?

84
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:47,543
Here we are.

85
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:48,882
Nice and hot.

86
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,318
Thank you.

87
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:51,685
So, um...

88
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:53,781
you two seem to be old friends.

89
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:55,815
Dr. Mora is
the Bajoran scientist

90
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:58,327
who was assigned to
me after l was found.

91
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:01,331
l was personally responsible
for his development

92
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:02,957
during his formative years.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,093
So, this is a family reunion.

94
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:06,397
l had a hunch.

95
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:09,463
Well, Odo's dad is
always welcome at Quark's.

96
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:10,768
-He is not...
-Actually...

97
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:12,673
l know he wouldn't
tell you himself

98
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,905
but Odo is doing a wonderful job
here on the station

99
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:16,435
-if l may say so.
-ls he?

100
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,573
Absolutely.
As a matter of fact

101
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:21,414
when you came in, he was just
beginning a fraud investigation.

102
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:23,044
Quark!

103
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:26,446
Excuse us.

104
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,957
Of course.

105
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:31,519
The two of you have
a lot of catching up to do.

106
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:35,123
lf there's anything
l can help you with, Doctor

107
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:37,395
don't hesitate to call on me.

108
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:38,833
That was uncalled-for.

109
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:40,461
Huh! You don't know Quark.

110
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:43,029
l know that he was
trying to present you

111
00:04:43,073 --> 00:04:45,064
in as positive a light
as possible

112
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:47,771
to someone he thought
was important to you.

113
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:49,438
And you responded with...

114
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,708
Please!

115
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,649
Still having trouble
with social integration.

116
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:55,777
l integrate as much
as l want to.

117
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:57,719
Define ''as much as l want to.''

118
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:03,284
''As much as l want to''
means as much as l want to.

119
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:04,817
Hmm.

120
00:05:04,862 --> 00:05:07,956
Quark is a thief, a con man...

121
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:10,990
nobody you want to know.

122
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,805
So, um, tell me about
this police thing

123
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,603
you've gotten yourself
involved with.

124
00:05:18,642 --> 00:05:20,041
ls it working out?

125
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:23,535
l enjoy my work
as Chief of Security.

126
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,138
Chief of Security

127
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:28,150
at a way station in space.

128
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:30,619
Don't you miss it, Odo?

129
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:31,951
What?

130
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:34,389
Our work.

131
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:35,722
Never.

132
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,488
l don't believe it.

133
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:39,393
l know you too well.

134
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,591
You were unhappy in the lab.

135
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,759
l can't blame you for that.

136
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,996
But the work, Odo, the work.

137
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:47,833
The exploration of you

138
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:50,931
what you are,
where you came from.

139
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:53,704
That's never far
from your mind, is it?

140
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:58,113
That part of it... is true.

141
00:05:58,148 --> 00:05:59,172
Good.

142
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:02,013
Because l came here
counting on that.

143
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,215
See you later, Dad.

144
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,784
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hold on!

145
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,795
l'm late.

146
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,796
For what?

147
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,797
For Nog.

148
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,298
-Your homework.
-lt's done.

149
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,766
You studied that
entire Klingon opera

150
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:21,927
for the music test on Friday?

151
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,529
l'm going to ace the test,
Dad, l promise.

152
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,799
This isn't about tests, Jake.

153
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,828
This is about learning.

154
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,705
You can't learn to
appreciate Klingon opera

155
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,539
by cramming for the exam
the night before.

156
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,807
What am l ever going to use
Klingon opera for?

157
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,838
Well...

158
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,214
first of all

159
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,049
you don't know what you're
going to be when you grow up.

160
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,523
You may discover along the way
that you want to be a musician

161
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:48,324
or you may find yourself
among some Klingons...

162
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,331
in a job... somewhere.

163
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,696
Dad, even if l did

164
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,894
they wouldn't be going
around singing operas.

165
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,869
lt helps you understand
their culture.

166
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:59,236
When was the last time you
listened to Klingon opera?

167
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:01,805
When l was your age.

168
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,673
There, you see?

169
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,734
Yes. Do you?

170
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,804
Just because you suffered
through all that

171
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,543
doesn't mean l have to.

172
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,915
Yes, it does.

173
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,145
Come in.

174
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:15,280
Dad!

175
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,654
l have the perfect solution.

176
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:18,658
Nog has the same test.

177
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:19,989
Why don't you invite him over

178
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,188
and you can listen
to the Klingon opera together?

179
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,159
Please, Odo, sit down.

180
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:37,066
Commander, l'd like to request
the use of a runabout.

181
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,635
Of course.
For what?

182
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,078
Dr. Mora Pol

183
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,877
from the Bajoran lnstitute
of Science has asked me

184
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,282
to help him secure
one from the Federation.

185
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,752
Why did he come to you?

186
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,915
Dr. Mora is the scientist
who was assigned to me

187
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,481
in my first years here.

188
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,857
lf he went
to the Board of Ministers

189
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,328
to request permission
to approach you

190
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,591
it would take months.

191
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,565
And he's very anxious
to investigate

192
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,898
something in the Gamma Quadrant.

193
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,495
And, may l say,
Commander, so am l.

194
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:07,234
You've gotten me curious,
Constable.

195
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,434
ls it a secret?

196
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,103
No, but there isn't
much to tell.

197
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:13,773
One of the Bajoran
science probes

198
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,873
recently scanned a planet

199
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,113
about six light-years
from the wormhole.

200
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,815
lt picked up some very
unique-- and familiar--

201
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,118
DNA patterns

202
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,091
patterns very much
like my own, Commander.

203
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,561
Dr. Mora thinks
he may have discovered

204
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,588
the origin of my people...

205
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,498
of me.

206
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:47,104
lt would seem to me

207
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,638
that being a scientist
yourself, Lieutenant

208
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,413
you can appreciate
the difficulty of our dilemma

209
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,114
and the elegance
of the solution.

210
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,146
When Odo was first found

211
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,283
nobody knew who--
or, indeed, what--

212
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,294
it was we were dealing with.

213
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,762
A shapeless,
viscous mass of fluid

214
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,731
a veritable organic broth.

215
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,700
That was our Odo
in the beginning.

216
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:08,962
When did you realize

217
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,562
you were dealing with
a sentient life-form?

218
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:12,663
He didn't.

219
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,800
l had to teach him that myself.

220
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,811
lt's true.
lt's very true.

221
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:19,971
Tell her.

222
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,537
lt was a dilemma for me.

223
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:25,018
l had never seen anything
like these creatures either.

224
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,816
''Seen'' isn't really
an appropriate description.

225
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,219
He had no eyes, per se.

226
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:32,089
l was just trying
to describe it in simple terms.

227
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:37,620
He had never perceived
anything like us before.

228
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,029
Go on.

229
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:42,524
l knew l had to find some way
to communicate with them

230
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,594
so l transformed myself into...

231
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,730
lt was remarkable.

232
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,468
Every morning
l would come into the lab

233
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,499
and every morning,
Odo would be there

234
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,377
resting in his liquid form
in a Krokan petri beaker.

235
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,643
One morning l walked in
and Odo was gone.

236
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,378
The beaker was empty,
but next to it

237
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,286
was an identical beaker
that had not been there before--

238
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:06,088
a perfect replica in every way.

239
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:10,220
lt was... amazing.

240
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:14,098
Oh, it hasn't been the same
since you've gone, Odo.

241
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,764
Working with you

242
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:21,763
has been the most rewarding
part of my career.

243
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,900
Hmm!

244
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,411
We're approaching the planet.

245
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,504
Prepare to enter standard orbit.

246
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,105
Planet designated L-S Vl.

247
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,640
lnitiating scans.

248
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,949
There's a lot
of seismic activity down there

249
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,955
possibly volcanic in origin.

250
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,140
Moving into synchronous orbit.

251
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:15,741
Do the letters mean
anything to you?

252
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:18,040
No, l don't think so.

253
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,276
Judging by its position
in the ruins

254
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:22,475
l think it's fair to say

255
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:24,882
that this pillar represented
something important

256
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,318
to the people who lived here.

257
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:27,514
Why don't we take it with us?

258
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:29,045
Our computers back
on the station

259
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,024
might be able to decipher
the inscriptions.

260
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:32,582
Mm-hmm.
Where is Dr. Weld?

261
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:33,957
Dr. Weld?

262
00:13:33,995 --> 00:13:35,929
Over here.

263
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:45,564
l think l may have found
what we're looking for.

264
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:52,203
ls it carbon-based?

265
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:53,838
No, silicate

266
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:58,181
but vegetative,
and very much alive.

267
00:13:58,219 --> 00:14:01,154
Odo, Jr., perhaps.

268
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:16,228
Computer, begin transport.

269
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:32,813
Come on!

270
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:42,493
Computer, realign transporter.

271
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,497
Lock onto our combadges.

272
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:46,659
Stand by.

273
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,531
This way.

274
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,209
Ready for transport.

275
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,277
Computer, energize!

276
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:24,304
They're stable for now.

277
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:26,033
Dax is in fair condition

278
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:28,837
but the Bajorans seem to be
more seriously affected.

279
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:30,935
Perhaps they were exposed
to more of the gas

280
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:33,173
or there may be something
about Trill physiology.

281
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:34,704
l'm not sure yet.

282
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:35,737
And Odo?

283
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:36,750
l'm fine.

284
00:15:36,784 --> 00:15:38,251
The paralyzing action occurred

285
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:40,753
when the gas was taken into
the respiratory system.

286
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:42,050
And since Odo doesn't have

287
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:43,681
a respiratory system
as we know it

288
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:45,487
he apparently wasn't
affected at all.

289
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:47,994
O'Brien has off-loaded
the cargo they brought back.

290
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:50,155
He has everything set up
in the science lab.

291
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:51,255
l understand there are

292
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:53,232
some organic specimens
from that planet.

293
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:56,031
Maybe there's something there
to help you figure this out.

294
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,401
Good idea.

295
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:59,167
Will he be all right?

296
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:02,767
The molecule appears to have
quite an unstable structure.

297
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,335
That might mean
the effect is temporary.

298
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:24,856
l know how you feel,
Constable.

299
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,367
Feel?
About what?

300
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:29,130
When my father became ill

301
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,536
l can remember
how small and weak

302
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:34,006
he looked there,
lying on the bed.

303
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,339
He'd been so strong,
so independent.

304
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:37,810
lt always seemed to me

305
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:40,609
that there was nothing
that he couldn't do.

306
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:42,707
But, in the end, l realized

307
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,810
there was nothing
that he could do

308
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:49,482
and nothing l could do
to help him.

309
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:52,515
l appreciate your thoughts,
Commander

310
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,963
but Dr. Mora is not my father.

311
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:09,503
The computer is
having a hard time

312
00:17:09,543 --> 00:17:11,534
classifying your new life-form.

313
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,671
Why?

314
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:14,806
Whatever it is,
it keeps changing.

315
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:17,316
Somehow it goes through
a metamorphosis

316
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:20,650
every time it reproduces,
and it reproduces like crazy.

317
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:21,985
Look at this.

318
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:25,185
lt multiplied so much,
l had to change containers.

319
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:29,253
l'll put it in a level-5
security field overnight.

320
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:33,394
l wish Dax were here
to take a look at it.

321
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,026
How's she doing?

322
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:38,195
Dr. Bashir thinks
she'll be fine.

323
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:52,016
Any idea what it is?

324
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:55,146
l'm hoping it's a key,
Mr. O'Brien...

325
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:57,089
a key to my past.

326
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:22,438
Kira to Sisko.

327
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:27,250
Go ahead, Major.

328
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:29,256
Sorry to bother you, Commander

329
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,020
but we need you up here
in the Science Lab.

330
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:34,083
l'm on my way.

331
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,423
...the scan, sir.

332
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,899
No positive lD on the life-form.

333
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,100
The holographic readout...

334
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,598
Any signs of a break-in?

335
00:19:11,632 --> 00:19:12,997
Not that we could find.

336
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,557
The security seal on the lab

337
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:16,592
was still in place
when we got here.

338
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:17,865
l can't imagine

339
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:20,305
why anyone would want
to steal that thing, anyway.

340
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:22,775
You're suggesting the life-form,
itself, did this?

341
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,607
l don't know
what did this, Commander

342
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:27,307
unless a tornado passed
this way without us hearing it.

343
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:28,815
The room was locked.
lt's gone.

344
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,156
That's all l know for now.

345
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:31,916
Constable, get
a level-3 security scan

346
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,255
underway on the entire station.

347
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:36,090
Our scanners may have trouble
finding this life-form.

348
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:37,254
lt has metamorphic qualities

349
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:38,695
that were confusing
the computer.

350
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:41,393
You might want to run that sweep
two or three times.

351
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:43,425
Let's go to Yellow Alert.

352
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:45,528
Major, you could help
me by reviewing

353
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:48,768
the security camera records
and the heat sensor readouts

354
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:51,003
for the lab
and the surrounding areas.

355
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:55,412
Commander, l'm picking up
slight trace elements

356
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:57,541
near the ventilation
intake duct.

357
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,143
lt looks as though our life-form
may have taken this way out.

358
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:08,718
Dr. Bashir gave you
permission to be up and about?

359
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:10,023
Dr. Bashir wouldn't listen to me

360
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:11,723
and hid my clothes,
so l wouldn't leave.

361
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:13,026
l had to sneak out
to my quarters

362
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:15,225
in a hospital gown
that wouldn't close in the back.

363
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:16,427
What did this?

364
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:17,766
The working theory is

365
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:20,169
that life-form you brought back
is somehow responsible.

366
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:22,265
l don't believe it.

367
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:24,037
Good.
Find me a better theory.

368
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:27,969
Odo, Dr. Mora is awake

369
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:30,244
and would like
to speak with you.

370
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:51,059
l heard them say
something happened in the lab.

371
00:20:51,137 --> 00:20:53,071
The life-form sample is gone.

372
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:54,072
Gone!

373
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,664
We're not sure how or why yet.

374
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,868
l want to help.

375
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:58,843
Everything is under control.

376
00:20:58,878 --> 00:21:01,278
l know more about shape-shifters
than anyone in this sector.

377
00:21:01,313 --> 00:21:04,544
Anyone except me, and l'll
be running the investigation.

378
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,016
Besides, we're not even sure

379
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:08,746
it is
a shape-shifting life-form.

380
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:11,222
Any metamorphic characteristics?

381
00:21:11,257 --> 00:21:14,192
lt was changing faster
than the computer could analyze.

382
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:16,251
Any indication of intelligence?

383
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:17,762
Not unless you consider

384
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:21,198
wanton destruction of the lab
an indication of intelligence.

385
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,394
lt might be.
lt might be.

386
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:27,463
Don't dismiss any possibility.

387
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:34,235
Dr. Weld hasn't
regained consciousness.

388
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:39,174
l feel responsible.

389
00:21:39,218 --> 00:21:42,779
l'm sure Dr. Bashir
is doing everything possible.

390
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:04,742
The same trace elements
are inside the duct.

391
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:06,768
l'm following the trail.

392
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:08,507
Moving toward corridor 2-H.

393
00:22:08,547 --> 00:22:11,345
Nothing's showing up
anywhere on the scanners, Chief.

394
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:12,907
Yeah, l figured as much.

395
00:22:12,952 --> 00:22:16,285
Did the security cameras
in the lab give you anything?

396
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:19,883
The security cameras stopped
operating for 43 seconds

397
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:23,622
at 03:00 hours, five minutes--
right when the alarm sounded.

398
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:26,426
Stopped? You mean,
someone turned them off.

399
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:29,195
More likely some kind
of power interruption.

400
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:30,827
lt might have affected

401
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,701
the security field
around the life-form, too.

402
00:22:32,738 --> 00:22:34,035
We're trying to analyze it now.

403
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:36,040
Do the heat sensors
in the lab show

404
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:38,270
any thermal deviation
at the same time?

405
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,007
Almost a six degree increase
during the 43 seconds.

406
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:44,277
But then back to normal
after that?

407
00:22:44,316 --> 00:22:45,715
Affirmative.

408
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:47,378
Oh.

409
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,048
We may be dealing
with an entity that absorbs

410
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:53,250
low-frequency R-F energy.

411
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:55,385
lt might be feeding off
our power.

412
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:58,919
But an energy drain should be
showing up on our scans.

413
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:00,898
Yeah, that's true, Constable.

414
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:02,696
l don't get it.

415
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:05,169
Maybe this thermal deviation
was a result of...

416
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:07,867
Chief?

417
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:09,704
Hold on, l hear something.

418
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:11,175
We've got your position.

419
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,008
Nothing else is showing
up anywhere near you.

420
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:17,810
Well, l definitely
hear something ahead.

421
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,879
Can you hear it on the com line?

422
00:23:22,922 --> 00:23:25,015
No.

423
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:30,493
lt almost sounds like...
l can't describe it.

424
00:23:31,997 --> 00:23:33,828
l'm moving in closer.

425
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:38,500
lf you run into my wife,
don't mention l did this.

426
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:42,132
Move some backup
to the nearest corridor.

427
00:23:42,174 --> 00:23:45,371
Security to core section,
Level Four, corridor 2-H.

428
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:49,347
When l come home tonight,
she'll ask me how my day was

429
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:52,179
and l'll say, ''Fine, honey.
How was yours?''

430
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:57,680
Sometimes l don't think she
really wants to know the truth.

431
00:23:57,723 --> 00:24:00,692
So l do us both a favor, and...

432
00:24:00,726 --> 00:24:02,159
Oh...

433
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:04,924
lt's a structural breach.

434
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:08,659
O'Brien, report.

435
00:24:09,969 --> 00:24:13,097
l'm okay. l'm fine.

436
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:16,130
l think l found
our missing life-form.

437
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,915
Except it isn't
a life-form anymore.

438
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:26,349
lt's dead.

439
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:30,287
Station Log, Stardate 47391.7.

440
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:33,780
Engineering crews have been
working for over 15 hours

441
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:35,123
searching conduits.

442
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,651
There have been
no additional incidents

443
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:39,254
and no further evidence

444
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:41,892
of the alien life-form
has been found.

445
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:43,697
With this kind
of cellular structure

446
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:46,466
the life-form would have needed
a higher concentration

447
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:48,905
of carbon dioxide
than our atmosphere provides.

448
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:51,136
lt just couldn't survive
out of its own environment.

449
00:24:51,176 --> 00:24:52,768
Well, that would be my analysis.

450
00:24:52,811 --> 00:24:54,938
But, with that in mind,
do you still think

451
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,471
this life-form was capable
of destroying the lab?

452
00:24:58,484 --> 00:24:59,917
That's not impossible.

453
00:24:59,952 --> 00:25:01,510
The environmental impact

454
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:03,919
might have taken
some time to set in.

455
00:25:03,956 --> 00:25:06,584
l'd really like to get Dr.
Mora's opinion on all of this.

456
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:07,922
Well, he's much better.

457
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,757
He should be up and around
in the morning.

458
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:12,764
Feel like getting a <i>raktajino</i>
before we call it a night?

459
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:14,663
My replicator or yours?

460
00:25:16,468 --> 00:25:18,902
l was thinking
more of the Promenade.

461
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:20,598
l knew that.

462
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:22,004
Well, thanks, anyway.

463
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,771
l got a few things
to wrap up around here.

464
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,801
Sleep tight, Julian.

465
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:34,782
She enjoys it.

466
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,018
She actually gets some kind
of perverse pleasure out of it.

467
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:42,788
And one of these days,
l'm going to stop chasing her

468
00:25:42,828 --> 00:25:44,955
and then we'll see.

469
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:38,416
Emergency.

470
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:40,252
Emergency!

471
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,451
lntruder alert.

472
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:58,640
lt happened so quickly.

473
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:01,508
l'm sorry l can't tell you
any more about it.

474
00:27:01,544 --> 00:27:04,172
lt was behind me,
and then it was gone

475
00:27:04,214 --> 00:27:07,411
but it was big, very big.

476
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,214
How badly did you injure it?

477
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,720
l don't know.

478
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,155
l don't even know
if l injured it at all.

479
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,522
l just hit it once
with a laser scalpel

480
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,618
in the arm or the leg
or the tentacle

481
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:19,958
or whatever it was.

482
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:22,520
And then it went
off the wall and was gone.

483
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:25,261
lt appears as though
our life-form has survived

484
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:27,394
and grown into something
interesting.

485
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,734
Did you notice anything

486
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,706
when you entered
the room, Doctor?

487
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,072
Anything out of place,
anything unusual?

488
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:38,608
Was it unusually warm, perhaps?

489
00:27:38,648 --> 00:27:42,607
Now that you come to mention it,
it was a bit warm in here.

490
00:27:42,652 --> 00:27:45,143
Another thermal distortion.

491
00:27:45,188 --> 00:27:47,156
Did you try the lights, Doctor?

492
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,182
No, l didn't want
to disturb the patients.

493
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:51,784
Commander, l suggest we check

494
00:27:51,828 --> 00:27:53,796
the R-F energy flow
to the lnfirmary.

495
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,661
We might find
a power interruption

496
00:27:55,698 --> 00:27:56,858
as we did in the lab.

497
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,663
No blood or any fluid traces

498
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:00,862
but l am picking up
a very slight trail of something

499
00:28:00,904 --> 00:28:02,769
we didn't see last time--
an organic residue.

500
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,773
Enough to test?

501
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,774
We'll see.

502
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,775
Sisko to Ops.

503
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,935
Go ahead.

504
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,740
Restrict all nonessential
personnel to their quarters

505
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:11,178
and go to Red Alert, Major.

506
00:28:11,214 --> 00:28:12,238
Understood.

507
00:28:12,282 --> 00:28:13,772
Keep in touch
with Dax's progress.

508
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,751
She may give us a way
to track this thing.

509
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:19,118
Until we can, l suggest
we close down the Promenade.

510
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,146
l'll give the order, Constable.

511
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,455
''Constable''?

512
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,155
lt's a nickname
that l barely tolerate.

513
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:28,460
lt's an expression of affection

514
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,830
that you find
difficult to accept.

515
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,839
You know, that was
a remarkable display back there.

516
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:43,971
Display?

517
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,481
Yes, you were very careful,
attentive.

518
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,143
l was just doing my job.

519
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,652
l begin to think
that the scientific method

520
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,917
and police method
have a lot in common.

521
00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:54,321
l never thought of it that way.

522
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,415
Perhaps they do.

523
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,358
ln science, we look
for the obvious.

524
00:28:57,393 --> 00:28:58,883
We track in a straight line.

525
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:00,987
lf something looks
too good to be true

526
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:02,292
it usually isn't true.

527
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:04,527
lf there appears to be
more to something

528
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:06,865
than meets the eye,
there usually is more.

529
00:29:06,903 --> 00:29:08,268
We take it step by step.

530
00:29:08,304 --> 00:29:11,273
That applies to criminal
investigation as well.

531
00:29:11,307 --> 00:29:12,934
You do it very well.

532
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:15,945
l'm very proud of you, Odo.

533
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:17,276
Do you know that?

534
00:29:17,313 --> 00:29:18,473
Huh.

535
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:32,891
Anything?

536
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:36,296
The computer's having trouble
breaking down the DNA chains.

537
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:37,594
What about this pillar?

538
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:39,465
Did the computer
have any success

539
00:29:39,502 --> 00:29:41,060
at decoding the encryptions?

540
00:29:41,104 --> 00:29:42,298
No luck there either.

541
00:29:42,338 --> 00:29:43,532
All things considered

542
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,438
the computer's
having a bad week.

543
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:48,569
We have such a limited database
for the Gamma Quadrant.

544
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:50,078
l have to close down
the Promenade.

545
00:29:50,113 --> 00:29:52,638
Call me when you have something.

546
00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:55,913
Wasn't that pillar
over here before?

547
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:57,283
lt was in my way.

548
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,582
l had it moved.

549
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:04,486
Have you compared this
new organic strain

550
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:07,826
to the life-forms we brought
back from the planet?

551
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:10,662
Only enough to be sure
that they're not the same.

552
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,565
lt might be interesting to see

553
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,002
if there are
any commonalties at all.

554
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:17,836
Let me run
a cross-tabulation analysis.

555
00:30:17,874 --> 00:30:20,206
lt should only take
a few minutes.

556
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,678
Do you know Odo well,
Lieutenant?

557
00:30:23,713 --> 00:30:25,442
Not as well as l'd like to.

558
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:27,176
He keeps to himself a lot.

559
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:29,514
l'm not surprised.

560
00:30:29,552 --> 00:30:32,385
l never realized
till l actually saw him...

561
00:30:33,723 --> 00:30:36,692
how much l miss him.

562
00:30:36,726 --> 00:30:39,695
We didn't part
on very good terms, and...

563
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:40,889
So l've heard.

564
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:43,865
Well...

565
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,026
he wanted to leave

566
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:47,696
and we still had
so much work left to do.

567
00:30:47,737 --> 00:30:49,898
But l see him now, and l wonder

568
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:52,464
if he wasn't right
to go after all.

569
00:30:52,508 --> 00:30:54,476
He's come so far.

570
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,139
He's an invaluable man
around here.

571
00:30:58,181 --> 00:31:01,947
l never thought he could do it--
integrate successfully.

572
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,976
lf you could have
seen him before--

573
00:31:04,087 --> 00:31:06,817
he was so ill-prepared
to be on his own.

574
00:31:06,856 --> 00:31:08,790
l was sure he'd come back.

575
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,692
l told him when he left
he'd come back

576
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:14,390
and, all these years,
l was so certain

577
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,526
that eventually, one day,
he'd show up at the lab.

578
00:31:21,037 --> 00:31:23,335
Well, l guess
l'd better get used

579
00:31:23,373 --> 00:31:25,523
to the idea he's not going to.

580
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:28,685
Oh, here we are.

581
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:35,157
Which one's this?

582
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:37,667
That's the new one
from the lnfirmary

583
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:39,169
and this is the life-form
from the planet

584
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:41,137
but remember, it went
through several metamorphoses.

585
00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:42,901
lt's not the same entity.

586
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,239
The nucleotide sequences
are entirely different.

587
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:48,507
Some metachromic similarities.

588
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:49,513
Yes...

589
00:31:49,547 --> 00:31:50,980
on a most basic level.

590
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:53,483
At best, they could
be distant cousins.

591
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:57,510
The computer's broken down
the DNA chain on the new sample.

592
00:31:57,555 --> 00:31:59,682
l can run an analysis
and see if it matches up

593
00:31:59,724 --> 00:32:01,624
with any other life-form
in the computer.

594
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:03,786
How long would that take?

595
00:32:03,828 --> 00:32:06,092
Two, three hours maybe.

596
00:32:07,131 --> 00:32:09,099
Let me know.

597
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:19,802
Dr. Weld has regained
consciousness.

598
00:32:19,844 --> 00:32:22,472
lt looks like he'll be fine.

599
00:32:22,513 --> 00:32:24,344
That's a relief.

600
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:29,683
You don't seem relieved.

601
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:35,819
You can tell that
just by observing me--

602
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,660
the tone of my voice
my eyes, my body movement?

603
00:32:39,697 --> 00:32:41,164
Yes.

604
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:46,659
You are truly a remarkable
life-form, Odo.

605
00:32:46,704 --> 00:32:51,403
But there is so much about you
we still don't understand.

606
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:55,276
What are you getting at, Doctor?

607
00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:57,678
The computer has broken down
the DNA chain

608
00:32:57,715 --> 00:33:00,582
from the organic sample
we found in the lnfirmary.

609
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:02,449
Dax is running
an analysis of it now.

610
00:33:02,486 --> 00:33:04,454
She'll identify it
in a couple of hours

611
00:33:04,488 --> 00:33:06,046
but l already know what it is.

612
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,990
l've seen it before.

613
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:12,959
The organic sample...

614
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:15,329
it's from you, Odo.

615
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:27,474
The destruction
in the Science Lab

616
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:30,412
occurred at 03:00 hours,
five minutes.

617
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:34,851
The attack in the lnfirmary
occurred at 19:35.

618
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:37,217
Roughly 16 hours apart.

619
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:40,121
ls your rejuvenation
period still 16 hours?

620
00:33:40,157 --> 00:33:44,491
Uh... l was in my pail
during both attacks.

621
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:46,758
But were you?

622
00:33:46,797 --> 00:33:48,264
l don't think so.

623
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,767
l think, Odo,
that you've been placed

624
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:54,828
in the ironic position of having
to track down yourself.

625
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:00,399
How could this be?

626
00:34:00,444 --> 00:34:02,674
Has anything like this
ever occurred before?

627
00:34:02,713 --> 00:34:03,737
Of course not.

628
00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:04,941
Are you certain?

629
00:34:04,982 --> 00:34:06,244
Yes, l'm certain.

630
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:08,774
There would have been incidents.

631
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:11,344
Any unsolved crimes on the book?

632
00:34:11,388 --> 00:34:14,721
There are always
unsolved crimes.

633
00:34:14,758 --> 00:34:18,159
Then the possibility exists.

634
00:34:18,195 --> 00:34:19,389
lt doesn't!

635
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,455
l do not commit criminal acts!

636
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:23,091
lt is not in my nature!

637
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:24,896
lsn't it?

638
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:28,462
The gas! Maybe it was
the gas on the planet.

639
00:34:28,506 --> 00:34:29,473
lt affected all of you.

640
00:34:29,507 --> 00:34:30,735
lt must have done
something to me.

641
00:34:30,774 --> 00:34:31,741
A possibility.

642
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:32,742
That has to be it.

643
00:34:32,776 --> 00:34:34,471
Certainly worthy
of an investigation.

644
00:34:34,512 --> 00:34:35,843
Dr. Bashir may be able...

645
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,678
Dr. Bashir will not
understand any of this

646
00:34:38,716 --> 00:34:40,980
except that you have
turned into some kind

647
00:34:41,085 --> 00:34:43,576
of uncontrolled thing
that tried to kill him.

648
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:46,454
Really, Odo, what do you
think they'll do with you?

649
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,548
Do?

650
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:49,582
They won't know
what to do with you!

651
00:34:49,627 --> 00:34:51,686
They'll put you
in a high-security prison

652
00:34:51,729 --> 00:34:54,357
or quarantine you
on a deserted asteroid

653
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:55,865
in the Gamma Quadrant.

654
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,334
Odo, they'll put you in a zoo!

655
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,861
l don't... believe that.

656
00:35:01,906 --> 00:35:03,168
You don't know them.

657
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:04,435
What other humanoid

658
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:06,943
have you been able
to trust, except me?

659
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:09,673
What makes you think
l trust you?

660
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:13,876
l resent that.

661
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:15,545
l really do.

662
00:35:15,586 --> 00:35:18,316
After all the time
l invested in you

663
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:20,346
after the education
l gave you

664
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:21,949
the attention l gave you.

665
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:25,756
You would not be here today
if it weren't for my guidance.

666
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:28,629
l gave you more
than anyone else in my life!

667
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,896
You were my life!

668
00:35:30,935 --> 00:35:32,732
And then you walked away.

669
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,604
And now you don't trust me.

670
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,607
Fine.

671
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:40,371
Put yourself in their hands.

672
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:43,539
You always had to learn your
lesson the hard way, didn't you?

673
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:47,576
l...

674
00:35:47,618 --> 00:35:51,782
am not going back
to the Center with you.

675
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:53,346
Why?

676
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,688
We'll work through this
together.

677
00:35:55,726 --> 00:35:58,923
We'll solve it together,
just like we used to.

678
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:01,988
No!

679
00:36:20,918 --> 00:36:23,887
l have a power failure
in Security, Commander.

680
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:26,719
Sisko to Odo.

681
00:36:26,757 --> 00:36:28,224
Sisko to Odo!

682
00:36:28,258 --> 00:36:30,783
All deputies report
to the Security Office.

683
00:36:30,828 --> 00:36:32,386
Possible intruder.

684
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:33,828
l'm tracking it.

685
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:35,957
We have a power drain in
the life support conduit

686
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:37,624
above the Security Office.

687
00:36:37,668 --> 00:36:40,660
lf it's feeding off our power,
we may be able to slow it down

688
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:44,299
by shutting off the primary flow
to the entire core section.

689
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:45,330
Do it.

690
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:46,934
Where the hell did it come from?

691
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:48,672
Security to Ops.

692
00:36:48,712 --> 00:36:49,679
Go ahead.

693
00:36:49,713 --> 00:36:50,941
There's no one down here, Major.

694
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:52,744
And there's no sign of Odo?

695
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:53,875
No, sir.

696
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:56,249
l can help you with that, Major.

697
00:36:56,286 --> 00:36:59,517
The creature you're after
is Odo.

698
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:00,989
There must have been some sort

699
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:03,321
of metamorphic reaction
to the volcanic gas

700
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,590
that we encountered
on the planet.

701
00:37:05,629 --> 00:37:07,563
ls there any way
to communicate with him?

702
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:08,565
l don't know.

703
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,157
lt's not Odo, really.

704
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,327
lt's separate and independent

705
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:14,303
from the Odo we know, and yet

706
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:16,636
at the very least,
it's aware of me.

707
00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:18,039
How can you know that?

708
00:37:18,075 --> 00:37:21,203
The incident
in the Science Lab--

709
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:23,042
l believe that was an attempt

710
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,039
to rescue the life-forms
l placed in containment.

711
00:37:27,084 --> 00:37:28,881
The second encounter

712
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:31,888
occurred in the lnfirmary,
where l was asleep.

713
00:37:31,922 --> 00:37:34,891
The third happened
just a couple of minutes ago

714
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:38,417
when we got into a heated
discussion in Security.

715
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:43,823
l think that even
the Constable himself

716
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:47,598
would arrive at the same
conclusions given the evidence.

717
00:37:49,707 --> 00:37:53,973
On some instinctual level...

718
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:56,708
the creature is
familiar with me.

719
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,968
We might even conclude it has
hostile intentions toward you.

720
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,503
lt had occurred to me.

721
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:07,811
The power shutdown
is complete, Commander.

722
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,979
Odo-- or whatever
it is in there--

723
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,148
has stopped moving
for the moment.

724
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,590
Chief, based on your knowledge
of its behavior

725
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,094
if we can lure him out,
is there any way

726
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,824
we can we set up
a force field to hold him?

727
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,628
We could reverse polarity
on the energy fields.

728
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,999
That might work,
but it's only a guess.

729
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,731
Set it up on the Promenade.

730
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,830
l want a lot of room to operate.

731
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:32,502
Major, station security teams
along the perimeter.

732
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:35,638
How are we going to get him
to come out of the conduits?

733
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,514
Maybe we could use some R-F
energy bursts to attract him.

734
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,917
There's only one way

735
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,717
that you're going to attract
that creature into your trap.

736
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,588
lt's me, it's after.

737
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,436
Mr. O'Brien?

738
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,064
Our plan seems to be working,
Commander.

739
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,267
He's following my trail
of energy crumbs

740
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,606
directly toward you.

741
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,873
On my signal, open the conduit
and let him in.

742
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,209
Aye, sir.

743
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,272
We're not sure
which vent he'll come through.

744
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:12,874
Hopefully, it will be
the first one

745
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,282
available to him--
over there.

746
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:18,449
lf not, there are 17 others
he might choose.

747
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,083
We're not stationing officers
near any of them.

748
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,592
We don't want to scare him away.

749
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:24,822
l understand.

750
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,330
Just get him to the force field.

751
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,855
We'll do the rest.

752
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:36,065
Pass the word that phasers
are to be set on maximum stun.

753
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,836
The moment Dr. Mora
appears to be

754
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,365
in jeopardy, l'll open fire.

755
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,241
Their orders are
to follow my lead.

756
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,907
lf maximum stun doesn't
bring him down immediately

757
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,415
we set phasers to kill.

758
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,678
Commander...

759
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,742
l know, Major.

760
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,377
Those are my orders.

761
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,618
Mr. O'Brien, we're ready.

762
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,426
Releasing the conduit seal.

763
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:03,366
Dr. Mora, did you hear that?

764
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,732
Ready and waiting.

765
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,673
What are you waiting for?

766
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:53,706
l'm here.

767
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,380
And l'm not going anywhere.

768
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:45,562
l've done it to you again,
haven't l, Odo?

769
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,003
Made you a prisoner?

770
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:56,136
Dear God, what have l done?

771
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,190
Mr. O'Brien,
drop the force field.

772
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:09,215
Aye, sir.

773
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:37,147
We have a lot... to talk about.

774
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:52,632
l'm not going to try and explain
what happened to you, Odo

775
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,161
because l haven't got
the vaguest idea.

776
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,231
l can tell you
that with Dr. Mora's help

777
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,743
we've managed to eliminate
all traces of the gas

778
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,472
from your cellular structure.

779
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,070
l prescribe rest

780
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:06,413
because it's hard for a doctor
to go wrong with that one.

781
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:10,682
Otherwise, there's not much more
l can do for you.

782
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,450
Thank you, Doctor.

783
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:22,859
l'm going home.

784
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:26,396
Dr. Mora...

785
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:33,871
l want to be sure
you understand...

786
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,209
l had no idea.

787
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:42,779
You had to speak in a voice
loud enough for me to hear.

788
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,380
l'm...

789
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:47,618
sorry.

790
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:50,525
l'm sorry it was necessary.

791
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:57,334
l would like...

792
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:00,826
in a very small way...

793
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,897
to be part of your life again--

794
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,271
your life here

795
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,866
on the station.

796
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,906
From time to time,
we could talk about things

797
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,609
that matter to you...

798
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,117
to us.

799
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,678
l'd like that.
