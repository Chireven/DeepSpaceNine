1
00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:08,632
l didn't kill him, you know.

2
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:13,064
A lot of people
believed it was me.

3
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:15,073
That shape-shifter thought so.

4
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:16,597
But he was wrong.

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:19,611
lt was a long time ago.

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,013
Say what you will
about the Cardassians

7
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:26,847
at least they could keep
the power on.

8
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:28,477
Would you like more ice?

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,544
l'm fine.

10
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:31,180
You were always very kind.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,348
Was l?

12
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:34,291
You made life a little easier.

13
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,692
l ran a black market
for anyone who could pay.

14
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:38,821
Never exactly thought
of myself as ''kind.''

15
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,957
There was always
that little extra ginger tea

16
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,990
in that package you gave me,
wasn't there?

17
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:46,232
You didn't call me to Bajor
to talk about tea.

18
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:49,540
No.

19
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:51,872
l need a favor.

20
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,968
For old times' sake?

21
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,000
That's right.

22
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:55,206
l'm still as kind as ever.

23
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:56,212
l can pay you.

24
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:57,475
l'm listening.

25
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,178
My husband kept a strongbox
in our shop on the station

26
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:01,185
buried in the wall.

27
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,686
l want you to bring it to me.

28
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:04,518
What's in it?

29
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:06,285
Nothing anyone would value.

30
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:07,622
Anyone but you.

31
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:09,149
Sentimental reasons.

32
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:12,162
Why not take a sentimental
journey back to the station?

33
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,357
lf it's your property.

34
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:15,525
l couldn't stand
being back in that shop

35
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,501
where my husband was murdered.

36
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:21,768
Or maybe you'd rather not
let Odo see you there.

37
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:25,766
l'm sure he's forgotten
all about that by now.

38
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,805
Can you neutralize
the security system?

39
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:35,847
lt's behind the paneled wall
on the left as you enter.

40
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,048
Four panels in, five up.

41
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,684
Four in...

42
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,591
five up.

43
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:45,994
And l can pay you
five bars of latinum.

44
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:47,862
Five?

45
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,833
And, as always, my...

46
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,995
personal gratitude.

47
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,610
A day...

48
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:03,375
maybe two.

49
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:35,291
Commence Station Security Log,
Stardate 47282.5.

50
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,796
At the request
of Commander Sisko

51
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,923
l will hereafter
be recording a daily log

52
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:42,332
of law enforcement affairs.

53
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:46,464
The reason for this exercise
is beyond my comprehension

54
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:49,532
except perhaps that humans
have a compulsion

55
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:52,636
to keep records
and lists and files--

56
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,477
so many, in fact, that
they have to invent new ways

57
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:58,109
to store them microscopically.

58
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:02,053
Otherwise, their records would
overrun all known civilization.

59
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:07,151
My own very adequate memory not
being good enough for Starfleet

60
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:08,990
l am pleased to put my voice

61
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:11,326
to this official record
of this day.

62
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:13,525
Everything's under control.

63
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:15,466
End log.

64
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:23,037
Now, when we get
to the entrance

65
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:24,805
you stay flat against the wall.

66
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:25,811
Uh-huh.

67
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:27,039
lt's a pulsatel lockseal.

68
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,877
l can get it to release
in 25 seconds.

69
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:31,008
25 seconds?
But somebody will see us.

70
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,017
Let me do it.

71
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:35,418
You?
We'd be at it all night.

72
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,715
All night?

73
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,922
No, only about ten seconds.

74
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:44,293
How would you get
a pulsatel lockseal

75
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,230
to release in ten seconds?

76
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,928
You have one
on the storeroom door.

77
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:50,265
So?

78
00:05:50,303 --> 00:05:52,635
Sometimes, when you forget
to leave me the desealer

79
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,105
l have to get
the storeroom open.

80
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:56,835
You've unsealed the storeroom
without my knowledge?

81
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,434
Only to serve
a customer's needs.

82
00:05:58,478 --> 00:05:59,445
ln ten seconds?

83
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,174
You forget fairly often.

84
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:02,545
Ten seconds...

85
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,976
We'll see how you handle
the desealing rod.

86
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,578
That's all right,
l have my own.

87
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:09,713
What?

88
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:11,053
Nog made it for me.

89
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:13,058
Boy's always been
clever with his hands.

90
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:14,421
My storeroom...

91
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,052
Time this, brother.

92
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:18,062
You'll be very proud.

93
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:25,096
There, you see?

94
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:28,664
Thief! Don't deny it.

95
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,801
You've been stealing from me.

96
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:32,242
Brother, l never...

97
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:33,245
Tomorrow morning

98
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,110
l'm changing
my entire lock system.

99
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:44,013
Four in...

100
00:06:44,057 --> 00:06:46,287
five up.

101
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:48,920
Here, it's behind this one.

102
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:52,897
Keep an eye on the Promenade,
while l burn off the panel.

103
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:54,092
The glare
could attract attention.

104
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,099
l have a better idea.

105
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:56,726
A better idea?

106
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:58,361
l took the liberty
of bringing along

107
00:06:58,404 --> 00:06:59,837
a small vial of magnasite drops.

108
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:00,839
Magnasite drops?

109
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:02,170
What are magnasite drops?

110
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,472
A compound that will eat
through duranium.

111
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,343
One on each corner
and the panel will fall off.

112
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,574
How do you know that?

113
00:07:08,614 --> 00:07:11,640
When you were
in the Gamma Quadrant overnight

114
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:13,276
we did very good business.

115
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,913
Naturally, l had to keep
your profits safe

116
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:18,753
but you had the only key
to the latinum floor vault.

117
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,520
You got
into my latinum floor vault?

118
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,549
With that?

119
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:29,226
l didn't want to tell you

120
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:31,793
because then you'd know
l burnt off your floor plates.

121
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:34,306
But l replaced them
out of my own salary, brother.

122
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,069
My vault...

123
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:38,076
Should l take it out for you?

124
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:39,610
Don't touch it!

125
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:43,911
Don't you touch anything
ever, ever again.

126
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:04,595
Just a piece of paper?

127
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:06,605
A treasure map, perhaps?

128
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:10,803
What does it mean, brother?

129
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:13,277
l have no idea.

130
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:16,748
Eight names,
all of them Bajoran.

131
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:19,047
l want to get
a picture of this list

132
00:08:19,118 --> 00:08:20,642
before l reseal the box.

133
00:08:20,686 --> 00:08:22,051
Go, get me an imager.

134
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,418
Go!

135
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,571
You can't be in here--
we're closed.

136
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:49,381
Well, if you really
want a drink...

137
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:55,580
She sent you, didn't she?

138
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:58,556
She knew you couldn't resist
opening it.

139
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:02,220
l'm sorry.

140
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:04,891
Yeah...

141
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:06,489
me, too.

142
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:17,836
Brother!

143
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:20,642
Brother?

144
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:23,806
Brother!

145
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,942
Help!

146
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:26,884
Somebody, help!

147
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,286
My brother's been killed!

148
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:36,258
Ten cc's of cortolin.

149
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:38,160
l want an antigrav lift
in here, stat!

150
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:39,664
Ready the cortical stimulator.

151
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:40,688
What kind of weapon?

152
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,064
l am waiting for an answer!

153
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:44,001
Whatever it was had
to get by the scanners.

154
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:46,061
My best guess is a compressed
tetryon beam weapon.

155
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:48,073
Okay, okay, that's consistent
with what l'm seeing.

156
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:49,334
Get the stimulator over here.

157
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,501
Doctor?

158
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:53,034
Thoracic cavity rupture,
extensive neural trauma.

159
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:54,603
Now.

160
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:57,415
Rom says it was a robbery.

161
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,542
Was anything taken?

162
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:00,814
He says he doesn't know,
but he knows.

163
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:02,684
Security's stopping
everyone at the airlocks

164
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:04,383
but it took them five minutes
to get into position.

165
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:06,448
The assailant
may already be on a ship.

166
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:08,084
Delay all outgoing vessels
as long as you can.

167
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:09,661
Advise their respective
security details.

168
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:11,253
We've got to get him
to the surgery.

169
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:13,060
Help me get him up here.

170
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:14,066
l got him.

171
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,397
Easy now.
Slide him in.

172
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:16,401
All right.

173
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:17,424
Watch his head.

174
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:22,369
He's dying, isn't he?

175
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:23,397
He's dying.

176
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:25,603
What am l going to do
if my brother dies?

177
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:29,945
Do? Oh, you'll have a lot to do
once this place is yours.

178
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:31,244
But if he dies...

179
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:32,581
Mine?

180
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:34,813
''Wives serve, brothers inherit.''

181
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:38,381
Rule of Acquisition Number 139,
if l'm not mistaken.

182
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:39,857
l hadn't thought of that.

183
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:40,916
Really?

184
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,521
l had, because it's
a solid motive for murder.

185
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:46,088
Yes, actually.

186
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:49,795
l have heard of a few
untimely deaths that seemed...

187
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:52,638
Wait a minute.

188
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:54,765
You're not suggesting
that l...

189
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,638
l've had my eye on you
for a long time, Rom.

190
00:10:56,676 --> 00:10:58,871
You're not as stupid
as you look.

191
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:00,003
l am, too.

192
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:01,172
l would never...

193
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:02,441
Constable, it's his own brother.

194
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:03,448
My own brother.

195
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:04,449
l hardly...

196
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:05,643
Stay out of this, Commander.

197
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:06,913
l know these Ferengi.

198
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:09,649
They'd sell their own flesh and
blood for a Cardassian groat.

199
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:11,247
Odo, he's a family friend.

200
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,258
His son is very close
to my boy.

201
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:15,192
Well, you'd better tell his son

202
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:17,422
that dad's going
to the lunar prison

203
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:19,959
on Meldrar l--
200 degrees in the shade.

204
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,719
l didn't!
lt's not true!

205
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,956
Oh...

206
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,588
lrony of ironies.

207
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:26,928
l finally get the bar

208
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:29,992
and l'm falsely accused
of my brother's murder.

209
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,867
Rom...

210
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:33,303
as a friend

211
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:36,467
if you know anything
that might be helpful

212
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,477
l think you should tell us.

213
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:39,808
lt was a list.

214
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:43,838
The man who shot my brother
stole a list.

215
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,783
What kind of list?

216
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:47,581
Of names...

217
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,383
eight Bajoran names.

218
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:51,890
lt was in this box
we... we found.

219
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:53,789
Found?

220
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,158
ln a manner of speaking.

221
00:11:57,863 --> 00:12:00,957
My brother was hired by someone
on Bajor to retrieve it.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,967
Who?

223
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:02,968
He didn't tell me.

224
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:04,333
He never told me anything.

225
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,361
l tried so hard
to earn Quark's trust.

226
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:08,873
Now he's dead, and l can
never earn his trust.

227
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:10,535
Just his share of the profits.

228
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,305
l swear l don't know
who hired him.

229
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:15,006
All l know is that the box
had been hidden years ago.

230
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:16,537
How many years ago?

231
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:19,608
l'm not sure... when
the Cardassians were here.

232
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:22,177
When the ship's store used
to be the chemist's shop.

233
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:25,485
The chemist's shop?

234
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:26,821
That's right.

235
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,528
Here? This is where
you found the box?

236
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:33,395
Behind a duranium wall panel.

237
00:12:33,432 --> 00:12:35,229
l'll show you which one.

238
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,066
Do you want me to open it?

239
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:40,128
l can do it in ten seconds.

240
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:56,318
You asked to see me?

241
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:58,550
Yes... yes, please come in.

242
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:03,227
l'm Gul Dukat.
We've met before.

243
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:04,456
Have we?

244
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:06,021
l wouldn't expect you
to remember.

245
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:08,795
l was one of the guests
at the reception

246
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,166
at the Bajoran Center
for Science.

247
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:13,467
lt must have been two years ago.

248
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:15,736
Ah, yes...

249
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:18,709
when the Cardassian
High Command was invited to...

250
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:19,972
view me.

251
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:22,878
You were very amusing
that night.

252
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:24,849
Was l.

253
00:13:24,884 --> 00:13:27,444
Yes... you did
a Cardassian neck trick.

254
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:29,351
Brought the house down.

255
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:31,913
The Bajoran scientist
who worked with me

256
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:34,448
thought you might
find it entertaining.

257
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:36,984
He made me practice
for weeks on the...

258
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:38,656
Cardassian neck trick.

259
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:41,723
Gul Hadar couldn't
stop talking about it.

260
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:45,498
He wanted to send you out
to entertain the troops.

261
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:48,302
l, on the other hand,
began to wonder

262
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,069
if you couldn't provide

263
00:13:50,142 --> 00:13:53,703
a more valuable service
for the Cardassian Empire.

264
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:58,510
l've stayed informed
about you, Odo

265
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:02,248
ever since you walked out
on your Bajoran keepers.

266
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:05,553
l simply felt l could learn
more outside a laboratory.

267
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:08,025
Yes, you've become
quite the student

268
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:10,323
of humanoid nature,
haven't you?

269
00:14:11,997 --> 00:14:14,397
Just what is it
you need, Gul Dukat?

270
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,594
Have you ever seen
a dead man before?

271
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:18,364
Yes.

272
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:19,803
ln your mines.

273
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:22,398
Oh, those are casualties.

274
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:26,042
This...

275
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:31,615
is murder.

276
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,609
And l've decided
you're going to investigate it.

277
00:14:35,654 --> 00:14:37,588
Me?

278
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:38,988
Why me?

279
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:40,389
l'm no investigator.

280
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:43,827
Ah, but l suspect
you'd make a good one.

281
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:49,198
Shape-shifting your way into
places the rest of us can't go.

282
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:53,899
l have no intention
of being a Cardassian agent.

283
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:58,038
Not an agent.

284
00:14:58,077 --> 00:14:59,544
An investigator.

285
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:01,011
There's a difference?

286
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:04,447
We can't have
these Bajorans running around

287
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:07,008
murdering each other,
now, can we?

288
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:10,112
l'm talking about order here,
justice.

289
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:11,588
There's very little justice

290
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:14,115
in the Cardassian
occupation of Bajor.

291
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,525
Don't push me, Odo.

292
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:23,029
My superiors would have me
''solve'' this murder

293
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:28,472
by rounding up ten Bajorans
at random and executing them.

294
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:33,809
l'm hoping you'll give me
a better alternative.

295
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:42,017
Now, these Bajorans
won't talk to us

296
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:43,885
but they seem to trust you.

297
00:15:43,922 --> 00:15:47,050
l understand you used to
sort out petty disputes

298
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,526
concerning food, blankets,
everyday sorts of things.

299
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:51,995
They come to you.

300
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:54,898
l suppose l'm considered
a neutral observer.

301
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:57,925
Of course...
you're not one of them.

302
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,064
And for that,
you should be thankful.

303
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:02,801
So...

304
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:06,436
here's one more petty dispute.

305
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,503
Only this time...

306
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:11,607
l'm bringing it to you.

307
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,618
Find the murderer.

308
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:23,457
Are there any witnesses?

309
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,171
l'm sorry to keep you
waiting, Mrs. Vaatrik.

310
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:35,696
This is Odo.

311
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:38,904
He'll be investigating
your husband's death.

312
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:41,913
Perhaps you two
already know each other.

313
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:43,710
Have you been into the shop?

314
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:46,582
No, l don't use chemicals.

315
00:16:46,618 --> 00:16:48,882
l've assigned this space to you.

316
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:51,219
We'll get you anything you need.

317
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:54,191
Madam, my sympathies.

318
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:56,456
Good hunting.

319
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,835
l'm sorry for your loss.

320
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,237
Thank you.

321
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:13,436
Do you...

322
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:16,346
have any idea
who might have done this?

323
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:18,282
l have a very good idea.

324
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:19,341
You do?

325
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:21,353
May l be honest with you?

326
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:23,947
That might be helpful.

327
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:27,058
My husband was having an affair.

328
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:34,529
Some girl showed up on the
station a couple of weeks ago.

329
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:37,467
He became infatuated with her,
l don't know.

330
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:39,164
Why are men like that?

331
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:42,736
Believe me, l have no idea.

332
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,710
We had two wonderful years
together...

333
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:48,178
until she arrived.

334
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:49,510
And now...

335
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:51,038
You loved him very much.

336
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:52,481
Of course l did.

337
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:54,577
Then perhaps you could
explain something

338
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,609
l don't understand.

339
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:57,588
What's that?

340
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:59,614
Mr. Vaatrik was found dead
two hours ago.

341
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:01,250
Mrs. Vaatrik hasn't shed a tear.

342
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:02,988
What makes you think...

343
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:05,963
By necessity,
l'm an observer, Mrs. Vaatrik.

344
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:07,329
When a humanoid cries

345
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:10,301
the epidermis below the eyes
swells noticeably.

346
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:12,495
Your epidermis is
perfectly normal.

347
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:16,154
l've been too angry to cry...
l, l... the shock...

348
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:17,995
Of course.

349
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:19,968
So...

350
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:21,526
you were about to accuse

351
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:24,301
this other woman of the murder,
l believe.

352
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,173
He confessed his indiscretion
to me days ago

353
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:28,938
but said it was over.

354
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:30,206
And when he broke
it off with her

355
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:31,474
she killed him
in a jealous rage.

356
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:33,209
Something like that.

357
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:34,978
Do you know her name?

358
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:37,485
No, but l can point her
out to you.

359
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,987
Move along.

360
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:42,286
Step back from the gate.

361
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:43,792
All of you.

362
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:46,886
That's enough.

363
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:52,156
Attention.
All bio-organic materials

364
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:56,604
must be disposed of
according to regulations.

365
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,301
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Vaatrik alive?

366
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:00,832
At dinner.

367
00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:02,309
He went back to the shop

368
00:19:02,345 --> 00:19:04,609
to do some inventory
work afterwards.

369
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:08,446
You don't live
in community quarters.

370
00:19:08,484 --> 00:19:11,783
No, we were lucky enough
to be assigned a private room.

371
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:13,584
l guess because we ran the shop.

372
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:15,147
But at least we had
a little privacy.

373
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:16,453
Uh-huh.

374
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:18,824
There... that's her.

375
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:27,692
Odo!

376
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:30,262
We haven't picked up anyone
at the airlocks.

377
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:32,831
l can't hold up outbound
traffic any longer.

378
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,776
l'm sure he disposed
of the weapon before he left.

379
00:19:35,811 --> 00:19:37,142
l heard about the list.

380
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:39,443
The one that Quark
got out of the wall.

381
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:43,509
Rom said it had been hidden
there during the occupation.

382
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:44,541
l couldn't help wondering

383
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:46,179
if it had something
to do with Vaatrik.

384
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:49,885
l've been wondering
the same thing.

385
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:08,173
Security Log, Stardate 47284.1.

386
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,271
ln this job, there is
no unfinished business.

387
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:17,342
This assault on Quark reopens
a five-year-old murder case

388
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:21,117
that l've never--
not for a moment-- closed.

389
00:20:21,157 --> 00:20:26,618
Patience is a lost virtue
to most; to me, an ally.

390
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:27,788
l barely saw it!

391
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,956
l'm sorry.

392
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:31,193
l don't remember
any of the names.

393
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,667
All right, all right, let's...

394
00:20:33,703 --> 00:20:35,933
just relax for a moment.

395
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,529
l really ought to be
getting back to my bar.

396
00:20:38,908 --> 00:20:41,035
He's not dead yet, Rom.

397
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:43,841
They're not keeping him alive
by artificial means, are they?

398
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:45,403
My brother wouldn't want that.

399
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:48,281
No, he's clinging to life
all on his own.

400
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:50,046
Typical.

401
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:53,019
All right, let's try again.

402
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:55,387
Close your eyes.

403
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:57,551
Take a deep breath.

404
00:20:58,794 --> 00:21:02,161
Clear your mind
of everything in it...

405
00:21:02,198 --> 00:21:04,962
if there's anything there.

406
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,490
Breathe.

407
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:09,568
Breathe.

408
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:15,010
Now... what do you see?

409
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:16,374
The bar.

410
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:17,470
Yes?

411
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:19,003
With my name on it.

412
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:23,677
The past, Rom, not the future.

413
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:26,017
The box opens.

414
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:28,352
There's a piece
of paper inside it.

415
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,550
Yes! Yes, l see it.

416
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:30,650
Quark unfolds it.

417
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:31,682
Uh-huh.

418
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:34,321
There's a list of names,
Bajoran names.

419
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:35,330
Right.

420
00:21:35,364 --> 00:21:38,231
The one at the very top
catches your eye.

421
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:41,703
And the first letter is...

422
00:21:41,737 --> 00:21:43,204
''C!'' lt's a ''C!''

423
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:45,469
And the next letter is...

424
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:47,032
Oh... l...

425
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:49,374
Skip to the last letter
in the name, Rom.

426
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:50,378
''O!'' lt's an ''O!''

427
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:52,380
Starts with a ''C,''
ends with an ''O.''

428
00:21:52,414 --> 00:21:55,508
And... and there's
a mark in the name.

429
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:56,882
An apostrophe.

430
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:57,886
Ches'so!

431
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,887
You're sure?

432
00:21:58,921 --> 00:21:59,888
Yes!

433
00:21:59,922 --> 00:22:01,287
Maybe.

434
00:22:01,323 --> 00:22:02,984
Maybe?

435
00:22:03,092 --> 00:22:05,959
lt's something like Ches'so...

436
00:22:05,995 --> 00:22:07,895
l think.

437
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,397
Oh...

438
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,834
Call me day or night
if you remember something else.

439
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:19,465
Uh-huh.

440
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,568
Anything?

441
00:22:24,914 --> 00:22:26,006
Ches'so.

442
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:28,413
Might be the first name
on the list.

443
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,546
Remember anyone from those days
on the station with that name?

444
00:22:32,588 --> 00:22:36,354
No, but l wasn't here very long.

445
00:22:36,392 --> 00:22:39,259
Hmm, so l recall.

446
00:22:39,295 --> 00:22:41,388
We never talked about it.

447
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,591
We never had to.

448
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:45,156
l would have been executed.

449
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:48,329
You were innocent of the crime
l was investigating.

450
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,531
That wouldn't have mattered
to the Cardassians.

451
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:53,007
lt mattered to me.

452
00:22:58,414 --> 00:23:00,609
Remember your passes.

453
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:03,413
You there, keep moving.

454
00:23:07,356 --> 00:23:10,189
This way, this way.

455
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:15,327
Radiation workers
report to observation level.

456
00:23:15,364 --> 00:23:17,161
Hi, Dad.

457
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,757
Hey, how are you?

458
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:29,437
Do you mind if l join you?

459
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:32,637
Sector Four salvage team

460
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:35,206
report at once
to your work stations.

461
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:37,685
A pretty girl like you
shouldn't be eating alone.

462
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,211
l don't do
whatever it is you want--

463
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:42,019
not for money, not for food.

464
00:23:42,124 --> 00:23:43,853
No, you misunderstand...

465
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:44,860
l'm sorry.

466
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:47,488
Of course, l can see
how you could.

467
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,019
Let me start over.

468
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:51,259
You some kind
of security officer?

469
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,790
How did you know that?

470
00:23:52,835 --> 00:23:54,325
You are, aren't you?

471
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:58,363
Unofficially,
l suppose that's true.

472
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:00,375
Unofficially-- what's
that supposed to mean?

473
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:04,072
Gul Dukat asked me
to investigate the murder

474
00:24:04,113 --> 00:24:05,978
of a Bajoran man named Vaatrik.

475
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,447
l understand you knew him.

476
00:24:08,484 --> 00:24:09,974
Who says l did?

477
00:24:10,052 --> 00:24:11,212
His widow.

478
00:24:21,463 --> 00:24:23,988
l suppose she also
told you l killed him.

479
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:25,226
Did you?

480
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:27,728
No.

481
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:32,400
On the contrary,
you were in love with him.

482
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:34,398
No.

483
00:24:34,443 --> 00:24:36,638
But... he was
in love with you.

484
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:37,771
No.

485
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:40,213
Doesn't sound
like much of a romance.

486
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:42,547
We weren't having a romance.

487
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,415
Then why would he tell his wife
that you were?

488
00:24:44,453 --> 00:24:46,216
You'll have to ask him.

489
00:24:47,756 --> 00:24:49,587
lf you were having an affair

490
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,991
l promise you,
l'll find out about it.

491
00:24:52,027 --> 00:24:53,426
All you're going to find

492
00:24:53,462 --> 00:24:55,191
is that l've been here
for two weeks.

493
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,357
l met the man
right after l arrived.

494
00:24:57,399 --> 00:24:59,594
He had Pyrellian ginger tea.

495
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:01,967
How he managed to get it,
l don't know

496
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:04,063
but l happen to like ginger tea.

497
00:25:04,106 --> 00:25:05,971
We became friends.

498
00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:07,876
Maybe he was attracted to me.

499
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:09,476
lt never went anywhere.

500
00:25:10,512 --> 00:25:12,844
Why do you think
Dukat wanted you

501
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:14,508
on this investigation?

502
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:17,682
l'm sure he had good reasons.

503
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,448
Why not his own security people?

504
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:22,115
No Bajoran would talk to them.

505
00:25:22,157 --> 00:25:24,352
That never stopped
the Cardassians before.

506
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,758
They have ways of getting
their information.

507
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:33,596
Something to think about.

508
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:36,900
Where were you last night?

509
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,433
l was at the bar.

510
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:43,501
l heard the Ferengi are allowed

511
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:45,775
to hire some Bajorans
for dog work.

512
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:47,577
lt's better than the mines.

513
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:49,515
You haven't spent any time
in the mines.

514
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:50,575
How do you know?

515
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:51,607
Your hands.

516
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:57,086
You're not bad at this.

517
00:25:57,125 --> 00:26:01,892
You're right, my last job was
at a replicator plant on Bajor.

518
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,488
You're not allowed
to quit those jobs.

519
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:04,498
What happened?

520
00:26:04,532 --> 00:26:06,659
l hit a supervisor...

521
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:08,931
for trying...

522
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,495
what l thought you were trying
a few minutes ago.

523
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:16,532
Oh, well, l appreciate
your restraint this time.

524
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:20,070
You're not planning on leaving
the station soon?

525
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:22,515
lf l were, would you have
the Cardassians stop me?

526
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,541
Yes.

527
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:28,147
Then, l'm not planning
on leaving the station soon.

528
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:32,955
Let me tell you something.

529
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:36,464
''Unofficially'' or not, you're
working for the Cardassians.

530
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:38,227
Sooner or later, you're going

531
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,564
to have to choose
whose side you're on.

532
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:43,196
l don't choose sides.

533
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:46,969
Everyone has to choose sides,
Constable.

534
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:57,675
l don't know
what you're talking about.

535
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:59,880
You knew nothing about a list?

536
00:26:59,921 --> 00:27:00,910
Nothing.

537
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:09,352
Why would your husband have
hidden a list of Bajoran names?

538
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:10,364
l can't imagine why.

539
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:11,456
Are you sure it was his?

540
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:12,523
No.

541
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:14,558
Maybe the Cardassians
put it there

542
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:15,830
before they left.

543
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,069
Someone on Bajor told Quark
where to find it.

544
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,576
l wish l could help.

545
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,635
l sort of liked
that little Ferengi.

546
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,510
Well, don't write
his eulogy yet.

547
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:27,913
He's still with us.

548
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:29,075
l thought you said...

549
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:31,608
He was shot
at point-blank range.

550
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:33,484
The Federation doctor
saved his life.

551
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:35,113
Good for him.

552
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:39,388
Does the name ''Ches'so''
mean anything to you?

553
00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:41,520
l don't think so.

554
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:42,825
Who is it?

555
00:27:42,864 --> 00:27:45,799
Oh, just someone
l'd like to talk to.

556
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,825
Thank you for seeing me.

557
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:51,430
lf this has anything to do
with my husband's murder

558
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:54,169
l want to be of help
in any way l can.

559
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:56,541
Oh, there was one other thing.

560
00:27:56,578 --> 00:28:00,207
l understand your power
was recently terminated

561
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:01,806
for lack of payment.

562
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,182
That's right.

563
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:06,551
Yet, you were able
to transfer funds

564
00:28:06,588 --> 00:28:08,818
to the power company
this morning.

565
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:12,793
l don't appreciate you looking
into my private affairs.

566
00:28:12,827 --> 00:28:15,523
Just part
of a routine investigation.

567
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:18,930
lf you could tell me
where you got the money.

568
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:21,936
A loan from a friend.

569
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:23,095
Of course.

570
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:25,766
And your friend's name?

571
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:29,834
Odo, this really has nothing
to do with your investigation.

572
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:33,939
Good, then you won't
mind giving me the name.

573
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:36,209
l'm sorry,
my friend is married.

574
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:38,151
l won't drag him into this.

575
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:57,835
Security Log, supplemental.

576
00:28:57,872 --> 00:29:02,775
The Ferengi holds on to life
like it's gold-pressed latinum.

577
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,404
Maybe he just doesn't want
his brother to get the bar.

578
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:09,576
Or maybe he knows he's
the only real witness l have.

579
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:12,017
The next several hours
will tell the whole story.

580
00:29:12,053 --> 00:29:15,420
We've done everything
we can for him.

581
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:17,424
l'll keep you updated.

582
00:29:24,165 --> 00:29:26,133
l've got some good news
and some bad news.

583
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,498
l think l found our Ches'so.

584
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:28,559
Who is he?

585
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:30,571
A Bajoran mining engineer.

586
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:31,572
He's been very active

587
00:29:31,606 --> 00:29:32,868
in charity work
for the war orphans.

588
00:29:32,907 --> 00:29:34,738
What makes you think
he's our man?

589
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:37,210
Some connections from my past
suggested he might be.

590
00:29:37,245 --> 00:29:39,406
His work brought him
to the station a lot.

591
00:29:39,447 --> 00:29:40,914
The bad news is, he's dead.

592
00:29:40,949 --> 00:29:43,679
Drowned in a pond
on his property last night.

593
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,682
l'm responsible.

594
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:47,949
How?

595
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:51,548
l mentioned the name ''Ches'so''
to the Vaatrik woman.

596
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:53,959
lf she recognized it
as ''Ches'sarro''

597
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:56,963
and thought that he might
lead us to her...

598
00:29:57,031 --> 00:29:58,794
Security to the lnfirmary.

599
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,323
Acknowledged.

600
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:02,097
Major, l need some help.

601
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:03,330
Advise the medical examiner

602
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:05,464
that l want a complete
autopsy on Ches'sarro.

603
00:30:05,506 --> 00:30:06,473
And that his death

604
00:30:06,507 --> 00:30:08,737
is to be treated
as a suspected homicide.

605
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:10,710
l'll need
the communication records

606
00:30:10,745 --> 00:30:13,145
for the Vaatrik home
for the past 52 hours.

607
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:14,648
And have the central bank

608
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:16,809
keep a supervisor
on duty all night.

609
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:18,648
l'll need several
bank records, as well.

610
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:20,119
Whose?

611
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:21,644
l don't know yet.

612
00:30:24,993 --> 00:30:27,985
l want round-the-clock
armed security on Quark.

613
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,427
No visitors.

614
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:30,556
Yes, sir.

615
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:34,928
Stop by one of the holosuites.

616
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:37,199
Two programs
for the price of one.

617
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:52,316
l'm looking for the proprietor
of this establishment.

618
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:55,987
Does he owe you money?

619
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:57,321
No.

620
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:58,723
Are you here to arrest him?

621
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,988
No.

622
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:02,189
Then you've found him.

623
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,562
Quark, at your service.

624
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,157
First drink on the house.

625
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,259
An old, dreadful
Cardassian tradition.

626
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:09,429
What'll you have?

627
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,562
l don't drink.

628
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:14,239
A soft drink, then.

629
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:16,209
l don't drink.

630
00:31:16,244 --> 00:31:19,372
l guess that's why we don't
see you around here much.

631
00:31:19,414 --> 00:31:21,780
l'd like to ask you
a few questions

632
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:24,512
about the death
of the Bajoran chemist.

633
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:25,519
Wait a minute.

634
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:27,987
You're the shape-shifter.

635
00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:31,753
You're the one
who's working for Dukat.

636
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:34,318
l'm not working for Dukat.

637
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:37,627
l'm just trying
to solve a murder.

638
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:40,691
No, l've heard about you.

639
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:44,796
You do some
Cardassian neck trick.

640
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,636
Am l right?

641
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:48,005
Not anymore.

642
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,009
That could go over big
in this room.

643
00:31:50,044 --> 00:31:54,606
l'm checking on the alibi
of a young Bajoran woman

644
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:57,174
red hair, named Kira Nerys.

645
00:31:57,218 --> 00:31:58,651
She says she was here
last night.

646
00:31:58,686 --> 00:31:59,653
Yeah, l remember her.

647
00:31:59,687 --> 00:32:00,381
She wanted a job.

648
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:01,570
How long was she here?

649
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:03,796
Long enough.

650
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,864
Long enough for what?

651
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:07,670
Oh, you know.

652
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:08,903
No, l don't.

653
00:32:08,944 --> 00:32:11,174
Why don't you tell me?

654
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:17,243
She was showing me
her... initiative.

655
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:20,914
ls that some sort
of sexual reference?

656
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:24,720
These jobs are hard to come by.

657
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,754
Her credentials
were, um, very impressive.

658
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:31,721
Hey, listen!

659
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,632
Listen here,
what's the problem?

660
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:35,330
The problem is, you're lying.

661
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,337
You got me all wrong.

662
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,531
l want the truth.

663
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:39,563
Otherwise, l'll just
turn you over to Dukat

664
00:32:39,608 --> 00:32:40,870
and he can get it for me.

665
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:42,274
Okay, fine, l didn't realize

666
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,210
we were dealing
with a murder here.

667
00:32:44,246 --> 00:32:46,908
She didn't pay me enough
for that anyway.

668
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:53,085
She paid you for an alibi?

669
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:55,214
l wonder how Gul Dukat

670
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:57,919
will react when l tell
him about that?

671
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:01,690
l'm sure it'll cost me
a case of Cardassian ale.

672
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,698
Two cases at the very least.

673
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:04,790
A broken alibi?

674
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,698
That sounds like progress.

675
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:09,465
ls there someone
you want me to arrest?

676
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:10,664
Not yet.

677
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:11,673
But soon.

678
00:33:11,707 --> 00:33:13,766
l need a name, Odo.

679
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:15,470
You'll get your name

680
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,570
when l'm certain
it's the right name.

681
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:22,014
Listen to the way
he speaks to me, Quark.

682
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:26,419
You're not afraid of anyone,
are you, shape-shifter?

683
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:28,480
Not even me.

684
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:30,650
l was right about you.

685
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:34,059
You are the man for this job.

686
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,826
Listen, l feel you and l...

687
00:33:36,865 --> 00:33:39,231
we've gotten off
to a bad start here.

688
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,132
Let me make it up to you.

689
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:43,262
You need anything?

690
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:44,602
A little ginger tea?

691
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,300
No, you don't drink.

692
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:49,708
Um... chocolate?

693
00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:53,306
Maybe, uh, companionship?

694
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:12,127
You look like you just lost
your best friend, Constable.

695
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,657
ls Quark, uh...

696
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:15,693
Quark is stable.

697
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:16,704
What's this?

698
00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:17,762
The list.

699
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,330
You found it?

700
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:20,398
No, l assembled it

701
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:22,410
from the Vaatrik woman's
communication records.

702
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:24,912
She's been talking to each
of these people a lot.

703
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:26,480
Odd thing is, she had never

704
00:34:26,515 --> 00:34:28,847
talked to any of them
until two days ago.

705
00:34:28,884 --> 00:34:30,476
When the list was stolen.

706
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,146
lnterestingly,
every one of them

707
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:35,122
has transferred exactly
100,000 Bajoran <i>litas</i>

708
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:38,183
into her bank account
within the last 26 hours.

709
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:39,193
Blackmail?

710
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:40,194
Blackmail.

711
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:42,219
What did they have to hide?

712
00:34:42,264 --> 00:34:44,425
For one thing, that they'd
come out of the occupation

713
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:46,434
with that kind of money.

714
00:34:46,468 --> 00:34:48,333
You think they were working
with the Cardassians.

715
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,806
Selling out their own world
for a profit.

716
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,068
Collaborators.

717
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:55,906
Not even a Ferengi
would do that.

718
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:58,105
lt explains a lot of things.

719
00:34:58,146 --> 00:34:59,579
Do you have enough
to charge her?

720
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:01,047
Not yet

721
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:03,209
but l'd like to bring her
in for questioning.

722
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:04,343
With your permission

723
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:07,355
l'll ask the Bajoran authorities
to transport her here.

724
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:30,707
Nobody ever had to teach me
the ''justice trick.''

725
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:32,906
That's something
l've always known.

726
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:36,415
A racial memory
from my species, l guess.

727
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:40,683
lt's really the only clue l have
to what kind of people they are.

728
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:45,523
Are these kinds of thoughts
appropriate for a Starfleet log?

729
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,391
l don't care.

730
00:35:48,997 --> 00:35:51,625
There's no room in justice

731
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:55,124
for loyalty
or friendship or love.

732
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:59,334
Justice, as the humans
like to say, is blind.

733
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:01,274
l used to believe that.

734
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:04,972
l'm not sure l can anymore.

735
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:07,607
Yes, l lied about my alibi.

736
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:10,584
That doesn't make me a killer.

737
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,985
Where were you
when he was murdered?

738
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:16,115
Asleep, alone.

739
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:19,058
No one saw you
in the community quarters?

740
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,061
l wasn't there.

741
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,858
l found a small corner and...

742
00:36:21,897 --> 00:36:23,660
You're lying.

743
00:36:23,698 --> 00:36:24,665
l...

744
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:25,688
Don't bother.

745
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:27,668
Your whole face changes.

746
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:30,068
l should have seen it before.

747
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,629
You don't lie well.

748
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:35,234
Thanks.

749
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,871
So why don't you
start telling the truth?

750
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:42,782
Whose side are you going
to be on, Constable?

751
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:44,409
l'm not going to play your game.

752
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,647
When l tell you the truth,
you'll have to choose.

753
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:48,918
No, no, that's why
l was given this job.

754
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,152
That's why all of you
always come to me with problems.

755
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:53,182
l'm the outsider.

756
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:54,456
l'm on no one's side.

757
00:36:54,496 --> 00:36:56,396
All l'm interested
in is justice.

758
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:58,456
lf you're innocent,
you'll go free.

759
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,628
lf not, l'll turn you over
to Cardassian authorities.

760
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,366
That's the only choice here.

761
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,377
l didn't kill him.

762
00:37:13,882 --> 00:37:18,876
When he was killed,
l was on Level 21.

763
00:37:18,954 --> 00:37:21,980
21? Ore processing?

764
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:24,287
Check the Cardassian
security logs.

765
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,817
You'll see a breach
on 21 last night.

766
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,890
l'm in the Bajoran underground.

767
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:35,835
l came here to commit
acts of sabotage

768
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,098
against the Cardassians.

769
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:38,400
Last night, l succeeded.

770
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:45,007
The ore processor was damaged
by a sub-nucleonic device

771
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:46,308
at 2500 hours last night.

772
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:50,182
lt'll be out of operation
for two weeks.

773
00:37:50,218 --> 00:37:54,211
Give the mine workers
a little time off at least.

774
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:58,885
l'll describe the device l used
if you still don't believe me.

775
00:37:58,927 --> 00:38:02,419
That's why you needed
an alibi from Quark.

776
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:04,864
lf you tell the Cardassians
the truth

777
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:06,560
none of this will matter.

778
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:08,796
l'll be executed
for the sabotage.

779
00:38:08,837 --> 00:38:11,533
Who cares about Bajorans
killing Bajorans

780
00:38:11,573 --> 00:38:13,336
when you can hang a rebel?

781
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:18,837
ls this her?

782
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,643
l told you
when l have the name...

783
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:22,309
ls this her?

784
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:28,889
No.

785
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:31,016
You can go.

786
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,698
lf you're lying,
shape-shifter...

787
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,899
lf you know as much about me
as you say you do, Gul Dukat

788
00:38:44,973 --> 00:38:46,565
you know l don't lie.

789
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:50,044
l am convinced
that she did not kill Vaatrik.

790
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:12,864
ls it too late for visitors?

791
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:13,868
l'm sorry, sir.

792
00:39:13,902 --> 00:39:15,199
No visitors are permitted here.

793
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:17,136
Then perhaps you could just
put these in water for him?

794
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:19,114
Of course...

795
00:39:50,545 --> 00:39:51,876
Odo to Bashir.

796
00:39:51,913 --> 00:39:53,437
Report to the lnfirmary
immediately.

797
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:54,448
On my way.

798
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:55,881
lt's over, Rom.

799
00:39:55,951 --> 00:39:56,883
Over!

800
00:39:56,985 --> 00:39:58,043
You're a hero.

801
00:39:58,086 --> 00:39:59,383
l am?

802
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,548
You saved your brother's life.

803
00:40:29,684 --> 00:40:32,482
l've never seen him before
in my life.

804
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,487
Really?

805
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:35,386
Your communication records
indicate

806
00:40:35,423 --> 00:40:37,516
that you made several
calls to his home

807
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,049
and received several as well.

808
00:40:39,094 --> 00:40:42,188
You also transferred
a large sum of money

809
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,596
into his account two days ago.

810
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:47,101
l want to confer
with my advocate.

811
00:40:47,135 --> 00:40:48,261
Certainly.

812
00:40:48,303 --> 00:40:50,931
l'll make arrangements
for you to speak with him.

813
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:52,530
Meantime, the two of you

814
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:55,134
can introduce yourselves
to one another.

815
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:06,183
l don't care what you think
you know, shape-shifter.

816
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:10,317
You will never be able to prove
that l killed my husband

817
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:11,655
because l didn't.

818
00:41:12,694 --> 00:41:14,093
l know.

819
00:41:33,948 --> 00:41:36,781
When did you realize?

820
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:38,809
The possibility occurred to me

821
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:41,879
when you got the name
Ches'sarro so quickly.

822
00:41:41,923 --> 00:41:44,153
Your friends
from the underground

823
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,923
must have already suspected him
of being a collaborator.

824
00:41:48,029 --> 00:41:53,194
Once l knew the eight names
were a list of collaborators

825
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:57,136
the murder of Vaatrik
made sense for the first time.

826
00:41:57,172 --> 00:42:00,573
He must have been
a collaborator, too.

827
00:42:00,608 --> 00:42:03,577
He had the money for ginger tea.

828
00:42:03,611 --> 00:42:06,171
He had the private quarters.

829
00:42:06,214 --> 00:42:10,674
l never had a motive
for his murder until now.

830
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:13,449
He kept his wife
in relative luxury.

831
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:16,514
She surely
wouldn't have killed him.

832
00:42:16,558 --> 00:42:20,187
So who would kill
a Cardassian collaborator?

833
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:26,062
Someone in the Bajoran
underground, of course.

834
00:42:30,305 --> 00:42:32,637
A colleague of mine
was given the job

835
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:34,733
of sabotaging the ore processor.

836
00:42:34,776 --> 00:42:36,744
Vaatrik was my responsibility.

837
00:42:36,778 --> 00:42:38,507
You were here to execute him.

838
00:42:38,546 --> 00:42:39,513
No.

839
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:41,037
l was here to find the list.

840
00:42:41,082 --> 00:42:43,778
The names of the Bajorans
who were selling us out.

841
00:42:43,818 --> 00:42:48,187
We'd been informed that Vaatrik
was their direct link to Dukat.

842
00:42:48,223 --> 00:42:49,884
Ah...

843
00:42:49,924 --> 00:42:54,258
That must have been why Dukat
chose me to investigate.

844
00:42:54,295 --> 00:42:58,026
He had to stay as far away
from this incident as he could

845
00:42:58,066 --> 00:43:01,832
so as not to endanger his
network of Bajoran sympathizers.

846
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,862
Obviously, l never found
the list.

847
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:07,669
But that's what l was
looking for in his shop

848
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:09,506
when Vaatrik walked in on me.

849
00:43:09,544 --> 00:43:12,240
l didn't have a choice.

850
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:15,372
l misjudged you, Major.

851
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:19,786
You were a better liar
than l gave you credit for.

852
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:22,415
You were working
for the Cardassians.

853
00:43:22,457 --> 00:43:24,891
l haven't been
for more than a year.

854
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:28,224
You've had all that time
to tell me the truth.

855
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:32,097
l tried to tell you
the truth a hundred times.

856
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,798
What you think of me...

857
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,637
matters a lot.

858
00:43:46,414 --> 00:43:48,746
l was afraid...

859
00:43:48,783 --> 00:43:52,048
That it might affect
our friendship?

860
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,689
Maybe it doesn't have to.

861
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:14,071
Will you ever be able
to trust me the same way again?
