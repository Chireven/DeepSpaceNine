1
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:06,394
What a waste of a morning.

2
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:08,899
That Galipotan freighter
that was scheduled

3
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:11,164
to be here at 0700
still hasn't arrived.

4
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:12,669
Oh, well, that's the price

5
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:14,569
for doing business
with a culture

6
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:17,632
that refuses to even acknowledge
the concept of time.

7
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:20,543
Though l must say,
they make magnificent sweaters.

8
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,513
l hope l'm not
boring you, Doctor.

9
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:23,844
Oh, not at all.

10
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:25,850
No, l-l was just
up late last night.

11
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:28,182
Entertaining one
of your lady friends?

12
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:29,481
Unfortunately not.

13
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:32,149
No, l was reading
the last few chapters

14
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,317
of <i>The Never-ending Sacri</i>fi<i>ce.</i>

15
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,451
lsn't it superb?

16
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,688
Without a doubt

17
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:39,356
the finest Cardassian
novel ever written.

18
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:41,866
l'll take your word for it.

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,993
So, you didn't enjoy it?

20
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:46,800
Well, l-l thought
it was interesting.

21
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,136
Maybe a little dull in parts.

22
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,405
Oh, wonderful!

23
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:54,207
At this rate, we'll be
done eating lunch

24
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:55,439
just in time for dinner.

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,778
Well, there's always Quark's.

26
00:00:57,816 --> 00:00:59,579
True, but l'm really
not in the mood

27
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:01,779
for noisy, crowded
and vulgar today.

28
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,880
l suppose the Klingon restaurant
is out of the question.

29
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:06,049
l can't believe

30
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:07,558
that l'm having lunch
with a man who thinks

31
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:10,618
<i>The Never-ending</i>
<i>Sacri</i>fi<i>ce</i> is dull.

32
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:14,120
l just thought the story got a
little redundant after a while.

33
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,760
l mean, the author's
supposed to be chronicling

34
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:18,770
seven generations
of a single family

35
00:01:18,804 --> 00:01:21,500
but he tells the same story
over and over again.

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,906
All of his characters
lead selfless lives

37
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:26,672
of duty to the state,
grow old and die.

38
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,043
Then, the next generation
comes along

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,104
and does it all over again.

40
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:30,739
But that's exactly the point,
Doctor.

41
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:33,580
The repetitive epic
is the most elegant form

42
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:35,142
in Cardassian literature

43
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:38,987
and <i>The Never-ending Sacri</i>fi<i>ce</i>
is its greatest achievement.

44
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:41,185
But none of his characters
ever really come alive.

45
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:44,524
And there's more to life
than duty to the state.

46
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,055
A Federation viewpoint
if ever l heard one.

47
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,328
This is ridiculous.

48
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:51,131
Can't you just move
to the front of the line?

49
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:53,399
Tell them it's a medical
emergency or something.

50
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:54,564
We'll be there in a minute.

51
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:56,437
Look, maybe if you
lent me another book

52
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:57,533
by a different writer...

53
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,544
lt would only be
a waste of time.

54
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,411
When it comes to art,
you're obviously a prisoner

55
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:04,813
of Federation dogma
and human prejudice.

56
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,341
l'm sorry you feel that way.

57
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:08,478
l was just trying...

58
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:10,488
Are you all right?

59
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:11,648
l'm fine.

60
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,850
You don't look fine.

61
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,359
Your skin is clammy
and your pupils have contracted.

62
00:02:15,394 --> 00:02:17,624
l assure you,
l'm in perfect health.

63
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:20,893
Now you were asking
about other Cardassian books.

64
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,457
Something maybe
a little more access...

65
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:24,901
Perfect health.

66
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,494
Then Cardassian standards

67
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:28,563
must be a little lower
than mine.

68
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:29,631
Come on.

69
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:31,642
Doctor, what do you
think you're doing?

70
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:33,644
l'm taking you to the lnfirmary.

71
00:02:33,678 --> 00:02:35,168
That won't be necessary.

72
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:36,942
Well, maybe not,
but humor me.

73
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:39,507
Frankly, Doctor...

74
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:41,849
l'm a little tired
of humoring you.

75
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:44,117
Now, there's nothing
wrong with me

76
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:47,182
that a little peace
and privacy wouldn't cure.

77
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,816
Now, if you'll excuse me

78
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,021
l seem to have lost my appetite.

79
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,634
What was that all about?

80
00:02:58,036 --> 00:03:00,869
l have no idea.

81
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,828
Can you tell
what's wrong with it?

82
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:06,831
ln my expert medical opinion

83
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:09,129
l'd say it's... sick.

84
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:13,364
l know that, but why is it sick?

85
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:15,566
l'm a doctor, not a botanist.

86
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,905
Did you ask Professor O'Brien?

87
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,639
Keiko's at a hydroponics
conference on Rigel lV.

88
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,271
She won't be back for a week.

89
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:23,747
And none of your past hosts

90
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,682
have had any experience
with plants?

91
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:28,151
Daxes have never
been much on gardening.

92
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:29,244
Tobin was the only one

93
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,720
who ever tried
his hand at it

94
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,552
but he had even less
luck with plants

95
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:33,751
than he did with women.

96
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,919
Do you even know
where it's from?

97
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,156
l picked it up on Ledonia lll.

98
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,032
May l?

99
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:44,001
Be my guest.

100
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:51,141
Oh, that explains it.

101
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:53,906
Ledonian soil contains
a benevolent mycorrhizal fungus

102
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:56,175
that helps the native plants
retain water.

103
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:59,547
The fungus in this potting soil
has almost completely died out.

104
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:01,313
But if we can salvage
what's left

105
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:03,218
and cultivate a new batch
in the lab

106
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:04,619
that should do the trick.

107
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,123
Keiko would be proud of you.

108
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:07,749
lt's all there on the screen.

109
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:10,886
l only wish my humanoid patients
were as easy to treat.

110
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:13,727
Did Chief O'Brien
dislocate his shoulder again?

111
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:14,959
No, it's Garak.

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,467
Today at lunch,
he seemed as though

113
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,332
he was going to have
some kind of seizure.

114
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,667
He was having trouble breathing

115
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:21,672
and he appeared to be
in a great deal of pain.

116
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:23,674
But when l tried to get him
to come to the lnfirmary

117
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,005
he outright refused.

118
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:27,910
Maybe he just doesn't like
going to see the doctor.

119
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:29,470
Ah, that's not it.

120
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,449
lt's that damned Cardassian
evasiveness of his.

121
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:35,146
l mean, keeping me guessing
about his past is one thing

122
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,619
but when it comes
to his health...

123
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:38,384
l don't know.

124
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,589
Why can't he just tell me
what's going on?

125
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:44,561
lt sounds like you're
taking this personally.

126
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:45,824
l suppose l am.

127
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:46,888
lt's just that Garak and l

128
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:48,489
have been having
lunch together once a week

129
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,522
for more than a year now.

130
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,034
You'd think he'd come
to trust me a little.

131
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,161
Why should he?

132
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,296
lt's not like the two of you
are really friends.

133
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:57,172
Well, no, of course not.

134
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,869
l suppose
when it comes right down to it

135
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,968
l don't trust him either.

136
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:02,138
l mean, for all l know,
the man is a Cardassian spy.

137
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,112
Exactly.

138
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:05,115
Exactly.
And if he doesn't want my help

139
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:06,741
that's his prerogative.

140
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:33,296
So, l take it,
we understand each other.

141
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:36,631
Garak, how long have you
been living on this station?

142
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:37,965
Too long.

143
00:07:38,003 --> 00:07:40,972
And in all that time,
have l ever let you down?

144
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:43,304
l have never done business
with you until now.

145
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:46,311
Which is why this deal
is so important to me.

146
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:50,475
l want our business relationship
to get off on the right foot.

147
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:52,005
Now relax.

148
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,711
You'll get your merchandise.

149
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:54,719
Soon, Quark.

150
00:07:54,753 --> 00:07:56,653
l can't wait much longer.

151
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:03,220
You and Garak
going into business?

152
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:06,856
l couldn't help overhearing
your conversation.

153
00:08:06,898 --> 00:08:07,990
Oh, that.

154
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:09,159
l'm helping Garak

155
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,795
get a new sizing scanner
for his shop.

156
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:13,532
A sizing scanner.

157
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:15,267
Not just any sizing scanner.

158
00:08:15,307 --> 00:08:17,434
The best,
straight from Merak ll.

159
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:20,604
Calibrated to be accurate
down to the micrometer

160
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:23,944
and l might add,
at a very reasonable price.

161
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:26,974
Really? l thought Garak
sounded a bit upset.

162
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:28,485
Upset? Garak?

163
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,579
Oh, l hadn't noticed.

164
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:34,524
Now, is there anything
l can do for you, hmm?

165
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,357
A little Saurian brandy to go

166
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:42,197
or maybe a late-night
session in a holosuite?

167
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:43,826
No, thank you.

168
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:47,100
l think l'll call it a night.

169
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:48,766
Suit yourself.

170
00:08:57,482 --> 00:09:00,781
There, how does that feel?

171
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,252
Much better.

172
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:06,053
Well, try not to yell
at any more admirals for awhile.

173
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:07,318
l wasn't yelling.

174
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:10,419
l was just expressing
my feelings, loudly.

175
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:11,429
Chief.

176
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:12,430
Commander.

177
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,261
You wanted to see me?

178
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:15,630
Ah, yes.

179
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,225
l was hoping
you could give me a hand.

180
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:19,430
l've been trying to access
the old Cardassian medical files

181
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:20,995
but l haven't been
having much luck.

182
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,028
l'm not surprised.

183
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:24,507
The Cardassians
did a general systems sweep

184
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:25,874
before they pulled out.

185
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:28,209
The medical files
would have been deleted

186
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:29,804
along with everything else.

187
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:32,408
ls there any way
to recover them?

188
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:34,078
Maybe.

189
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:36,986
These subroutines don't
look anywhere near as bad

190
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:38,717
as the engineering files did.

191
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:41,089
l might be able
to reconstruct the data

192
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:43,185
by micro-scanning
the purge trace.

193
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:44,593
Well, how long will that take?

194
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:47,223
Mmm. Two, maybe three weeks.

195
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:51,395
Ah. Well, that settles that.

196
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:53,233
Thank you anyway, Chief.

197
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:54,966
l'm sorry l couldn't
be of any more help.

198
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:56,769
Quark to Bashir.

199
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:57,866
This is Bashir.

200
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:00,776
Doctor, l need you
in my bar right away.

201
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:10,320
Oh, come on, Garak.

202
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:12,653
Don't you think
you've had enough?

203
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:13,953
On the contrary.

204
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:15,687
Anyone who talks about

205
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:18,389
the numbing effects
of your liquor

206
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,490
is severely overstating
the case, huh?

207
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,066
What's all this?

208
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:25,797
He came in complaining
about a headache.

209
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:26,804
The next thing l knew

210
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:28,396
he drank up
half my stock of <i>kanar.</i>

211
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,878
Oh, Doctor,
what a pleasant surprise.

212
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:36,142
l apologize
for my outburst at lunch

213
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:38,546
but l promise
l'll make it up to you.

214
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,074
Please, join me.

215
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:44,347
l think l will.

216
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:45,378
May l?

217
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:46,549
By all means.

218
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:48,286
What are you doing?!

219
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:51,352
l think it's
a little noisy in here.

220
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:54,456
Um, l'd prefer to drink
somewhere quiet.

221
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:57,434
Why, an excellent idea.

222
00:10:57,469 --> 00:11:00,336
We'll go to my quarters.

223
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:01,999
Whatever you want.

224
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,204
But, first, l must make
a stop at the lnfirmary.

225
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:07,768
The lnfirmary?

226
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:10,246
Oh, my dear Doctor.

227
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:12,978
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

228
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:15,145
Now, give me back my bottle.

229
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,984
Give me my bottle back.

230
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:20,389
l will...

231
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:21,517
in the lnfirmary.

232
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,824
l'm not going to the lnfirmary

233
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:26,660
and l refuse to play
this ridiculous game.

234
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,495
Now, give me...

235
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:31,802
Give...

236
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:39,371
Make it stop, make it stop.

237
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:42,639
Bashir to Ops.
Medical emergency.

238
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,478
Two to beam to the lnfirmary.

239
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:45,983
Energize.

240
00:11:56,761 --> 00:11:57,819
Some kind of implant?

241
00:11:57,862 --> 00:11:58,886
Apparently.

242
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,988
What's it for?

243
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:01,726
Well, l was hoping
you could tell me.

244
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:04,030
After working for
the Cardassians for five years

245
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:06,094
l'd guess you'd know them
as well as anyone.

246
00:12:06,204 --> 00:12:07,569
Maybe so,
but l never bothered

247
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:08,903
to look inside their skulls.

248
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,271
No, l don't suppose you did.

249
00:12:10,308 --> 00:12:12,776
Do you think this is the cause
of Garak's condition?

250
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:13,835
lt's possible.

251
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:15,106
l mean, whatever this thing is

252
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:16,943
it's situated
in his postcentral gyrus

253
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:18,540
and has filaments
that connect it

254
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,346
to his entire
central nervous system.

255
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,979
Maybe it's some kind
of punishment device--

256
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:25,819
a parting gift from
the Cardassian government.

257
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:26,915
l thought of that

258
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,357
but, based
on the amount of scarring

259
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:29,382
in the surrounding tissue

260
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,985
this implant's
been in there for years.

261
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,122
And as far as l can tell,
Garak's only been in pain

262
00:12:33,164 --> 00:12:34,131
for the past few days.

263
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:35,860
lnteresting.

264
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,028
l wish l had an answer
for you, Doctor.

265
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,834
Well, l was hoping
you could help me get one.

266
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:44,569
l think Quark knows
what this thing is.

267
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,236
Now, what makes you say that?

268
00:12:46,277 --> 00:12:48,245
l overheard them talking
the other night.

269
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,112
Garak was negotiating to buy
some merchandise from Quark.

270
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:52,411
He seemed quite desperate.

271
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,680
l tried to ask Quark
what it was about, but...

272
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,550
No need to explain, Doctor.

273
00:12:56,588 --> 00:13:00,149
The direct approach seldom
works with people like him.

274
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:03,455
But this could answer
some of my own questions.

275
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:07,329
Quark has sent several coded
messages to Cardassia Prime

276
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:08,798
in the past few days.

277
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,300
Really?

278
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:11,632
Mmm. l routinely monitor

279
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,797
all of Quark's
subspace communications.

280
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:16,102
ls that legal?

281
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:18,971
lt's in the best interest
of station security.

282
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:23,003
Doctor, do you want to know
what Quark knows or not?

283
00:13:23,048 --> 00:13:24,948
l see your point.

284
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:27,679
Then meet me in Security
at 0200 hours.

285
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:30,552
Quark always makes
his clandestine calls

286
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:32,112
after the bar closes.

287
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:33,681
l wouldn't miss it.

288
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:45,626
Quark, you parasite.

289
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,604
lt's been too long.

290
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,131
ls Hartla still working for you?

291
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:54,337
The dabo tables wouldn't
be the same without her.

292
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:57,405
Oh, what l wouldn't
give to see her again.

293
00:13:57,449 --> 00:13:59,076
l'm sure she misses you, too.

294
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,848
l'll bet she does.

295
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:04,218
Yeah.

296
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:05,984
She would have bankrupted me

297
00:14:06,024 --> 00:14:08,959
if the occupation would
have lasted much longer.

298
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:13,225
But l'm sure you didn't
contact me just to reminisce.

299
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:15,061
What can l do for you?

300
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,365
How would you like to earn
a little extra latinum?

301
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:20,871
Enough to buy yourself
a promotion?

302
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:23,396
You have my undivided attention.

303
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:26,239
l need a piece
of Cardassian biotechnology

304
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:29,542
and the schematics relating
to its installation.

305
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:31,811
Hmm, biotechnology, huh?

306
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,115
Why, that shouldn't be
too difficult.

307
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:36,347
What is it?

308
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:40,483
You know, l never ask
those kinds of questions

309
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:44,120
but l've got
the requisition code number.

310
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:45,560
Well, give it to me.

311
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:46,723
l'll look for it.

312
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:48,255
l knew l could count on you.
Here it is.

313
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:51,097
l hope you don't have
one of these little bugs

314
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:52,467
hidden in my quarters.

315
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:53,801
Should l?

316
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:55,135
Transmission complete.

317
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:56,299
Hold on.

318
00:14:56,341 --> 00:14:59,037
This won't take long.

319
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:01,944
Take your time.

320
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:09,178
Quark, you idiot!

321
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,551
ls something wrong?

322
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:12,249
ls something wrong?!

323
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,655
l'm ruined!

324
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:14,988
My career is over!

325
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:16,960
What did l do?!

326
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:19,088
You and your damned
requisition code.

327
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:21,098
lt's for classified
biotechnology, Quark.

328
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,963
Even the cursed number
is classified.

329
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:24,263
Where did you get it?!

330
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,463
No, don't tell me!

331
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:30,031
l don't want to know.

332
00:15:30,074 --> 00:15:32,508
lf l'm lucky,
l can still get through this

333
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:34,034
with my skin intact.

334
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,104
Maybe they won't trace
the request back to me.

335
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:38,308
Who won't?

336
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:43,046
The Obsidian Order.

337
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,612
Nice talking to you, Boheeka.

338
00:15:45,657 --> 00:15:47,569
We'll have to do it
again sometime.

339
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:49,594
We'll have to do it
again sometime.

340
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:52,573
The Obsidian Order.

341
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:54,541
That certainly
complicates things.

342
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:56,009
Who are they?

343
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:58,012
They're the ever-vigilant
eyes and ears

344
00:15:58,046 --> 00:15:59,673
of the Cardassian Empire.

345
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:02,012
lt is said
that a Cardassian citizen

346
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,848
cannot sit down to a meal
without each dish

347
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:07,684
being duly noted
and recorded by the Order.

348
00:16:07,722 --> 00:16:09,690
What happens
if you eat something

349
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:11,692
that doesn't meet
with their approval?

350
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,786
People have been known
to disappear for less.

351
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:17,662
Whether you agree
with their goals or not

352
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:21,499
you can't help but admire
their efficiency.

353
00:16:21,536 --> 00:16:25,199
Even the Romulan Tal Shiar
can't compete with them

354
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,037
when it comes
to intelligence gathering

355
00:16:27,142 --> 00:16:28,268
and covert operations.

356
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:30,368
What has all this
to do with Garak?

357
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:31,879
l wish l knew.

358
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:33,881
Do you think the Order

359
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:36,179
put that implant
inside Garak's head?

360
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:37,912
l have a better question.

361
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:40,420
lf the implant
is a punishment device

362
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:44,448
then why is Garak trying
to get his hands on another one?

363
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:46,585
He did asked for specifications.

364
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:49,859
Maybe he's trying to find
some way of removing it.

365
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:51,297
Well, either way,
l'd like to have

366
00:16:51,332 --> 00:16:52,731
a talk with him
when he wakes up.

367
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,462
You'll have to get in line.

368
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:55,867
Thank you

369
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,166
Constable.

370
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:04,834
Computer, report on the status
of patient Garak.

371
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:08,007
Patient Garak is no longer
in the lnfirmary.

372
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:09,346
What?

373
00:17:09,384 --> 00:17:10,715
When did he leave?

374
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:14,779
Patient checked out
at 0320 hours.

375
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:37,039
Garak, are you in there?

376
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:38,635
Computer, open the door

377
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,875
to Chamber 901,
Habitat Level H-3.

378
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:43,748
Emergency medical override,
Bashir 1-Alpha.

379
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:48,521
Ah, Doctor,
what a pleasant surprise.

380
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:51,582
l'm sorry, l must have
missed the door chime.

381
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:53,423
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

382
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:54,587
Triptacederin?

383
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:56,187
How much of this did you take?

384
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:59,689
A mere 30cc's--
not nearly enough, l'm afraid.

385
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:02,430
30cc's would anesthetize
an Algorian mammoth.

386
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,371
Oh, we Cardassians must
be made of sterner stuff.

387
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:06,498
l barely feel it.

388
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,633
Listen to me, Garak.

389
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:09,575
l've had just about enough
of your nonsense.

390
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:11,738
Now you're coming back
to the lnfirmary with me.

391
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,247
Oh, l don't think so.

392
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:15,112
Believe me when l tell you

393
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,516
there's nothing
you can do for me.

394
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:18,985
Oh, and Quark can, is that it?

395
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,148
l thought l was
supposed to be the spy.

396
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,748
Quark's not coming, Garak.

397
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,020
How do you know?

398
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:28,585
l heard him talking
to his Cardassian contact.

399
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,598
He couldn't get
the item you requested.

400
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:31,599
Really?

401
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:34,864
That's most distressing

402
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:40,205
but l suppose
not all that surprising.

403
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:44,905
Ah, well,
maybe it's for the best.

404
00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:48,814
My hypospray, if you please.

405
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,375
Another dose of triptacederin
might kill you.

406
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:52,943
Thank you for your concern,
Doctor

407
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:54,921
but l'd rather
have the hypospray.

408
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:57,049
l'm not going to let you
commit suicide.

409
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:58,183
l'm here to help you.

410
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:00,194
l doubt you can!

411
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:07,158
l think you'll find
that l'm experiencing

412
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:11,468
some slight deterioration
of my cranial nerve cluster.

413
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:12,768
lt's not so slight, l'm afraid.

414
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:15,435
We've got to get you
to the lnfirmary.

415
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,000
My dear Doctor

416
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:19,741
l have no intention
of putting myself on display

417
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:23,217
for the amusement of the Bajoran
inhabitants of this station.

418
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:25,344
lt's not your pride
l'm worried about.

419
00:19:25,386 --> 00:19:26,353
lt's that implant

420
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:28,651
you're carrying around
inside your head.

421
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,180
You know about that, do you?

422
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:32,022
lt's some sort of punishment
device, isn't it?

423
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,688
Punishment device?

424
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,325
Well, l suppose, in a way,
that's what it's become.

425
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:43,030
lf it wasn't put there
to punish you

426
00:19:43,071 --> 00:19:44,231
then what's it for?

427
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:49,236
Garak! l need to know
what we're up against.

428
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:51,575
lf you tell me what it's for

429
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:53,410
maybe l could find
some way to remove it.

430
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:55,177
lt's hopeless, Doctor.

431
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:57,309
Believe me, it can't be removed.

432
00:19:57,352 --> 00:19:58,341
How do you know?

433
00:19:58,386 --> 00:19:59,717
That's the whole point.

434
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:04,054
lf it could be easily removed,
it would be useless.

435
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,583
You see, on Cardassia

436
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:10,257
l was entrusted
with certain information--

437
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:12,926
information that needed
to be kept safe

438
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,867
regardless of the situation.

439
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:17,997
My implant was given to me
by Enabran Tain himself--

440
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:20,166
the head of the Obsidian Order.

441
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,732
lf l was ever tortured

442
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:26,008
it was designed to stimulate
the pleasure centers of my brain

443
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:27,776
to trigger the production

444
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:30,409
of vast amounts
of natural endorphins.

445
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:33,284
l do hope you appreciate
the irony, Doctor.

446
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:37,758
The whole purpose of the implant
was to make me immune to pain.

447
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,555
What caused it to malfunction?

448
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:45,327
lt was never meant
for continuous use.

449
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:46,765
Continuous use.

450
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,393
What do you mean?

451
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:55,274
Living on this station
is torture for me, Doctor.

452
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,677
The temperature
is always too cold.

453
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:01,113
The lights always too bright.

454
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:03,674
Every Bajoran on the station

455
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:07,176
looks at me
with loathing and contempt.

456
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:13,456
So, one day, l decided
l couldn't live with it anymore

457
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:16,554
and l took the pain away.

458
00:21:16,597 --> 00:21:18,861
You activated the implant.

459
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,528
l created a device
which allowed me

460
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:24,663
to trigger the implant
whenever l wanted it.

461
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:28,073
At first, l only used it
a few minutes a day

462
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:31,476
but then l began relying
on it more and more

463
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:35,744
until, finally, l just turned
it on and never shut it off.

464
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:37,410
How long has it been on?

465
00:21:37,452 --> 00:21:39,079
Two years.

466
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,088
And now the implant
is breaking down.

467
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:42,645
That's correct.

468
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,715
So, why don't you just shut
the damn thing off?

469
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,021
lt's too late now.

470
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,620
My body has become
completely dependent

471
00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:52,463
on the higher endorphin levels
generated by the implant.

472
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:55,393
So, that's it then.

473
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:58,648
You're just going to give up
and let them win.

474
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:00,180
''Them,'' Doctor?

475
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:03,083
The Central Command,
the Obsidian Order--

476
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,518
whoever it is
who exiled you here.

477
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:05,748
You're just going
to roll over and die

478
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:06,846
let them destroy you

479
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:08,982
give up any hope of ever
seeing Cardassia again.

480
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:10,719
Doctor, did anyone ever tell you

481
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,455
that you are
an infuriating pest?

482
00:22:12,495 --> 00:22:13,655
Chief O'Brien, all the time

483
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:15,721
and l don't pay any attention
to him, either.

484
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:17,232
Has it ever occurred to you

485
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:19,962
that l might be getting
exactly what l deserve?

486
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:21,492
No one deserves this.

487
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:24,165
Oh, please, Doctor,
l'm suffering enough

488
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:25,834
without having to listen

489
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,002
to your smug
Federation sympathy.

490
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:30,705
Do you think that,
because we have lunch together

491
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:32,715
once a week, you know me?

492
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:37,243
You couldn't even begin
to fathom what l'm capable of.

493
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:38,651
l'm a doctor.

494
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:40,451
You're my patient.

495
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,015
That's all l need to know.

496
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:44,559
Wrong again.

497
00:22:44,594 --> 00:22:48,792
You need to know
who you're trying to save.

498
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,993
During the occupation

499
00:22:53,035 --> 00:22:56,903
l was a Gul in the Cardassian
mechanized infantry.

500
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:59,931
We were stationed just
outside the Bajoran capital.

501
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:01,739
Shortly before the withdrawal

502
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:05,179
a handful of Bajoran prisoners
escaped from my custody.

503
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:07,239
My aide, a man named Elim

504
00:23:07,283 --> 00:23:08,910
tracked them
to a Cardassian shuttle

505
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:11,078
about to depart for Terok Nor.

506
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,485
Elim got aboard

507
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:14,854
but the Captain refused
to let him search the ship

508
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:17,860
because he claimed he was under
strict orders from Gul Dukat

509
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:19,555
to depart immediately.

510
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:22,723
So, l had the shuttle destroyed

511
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:29,364
killing the escapees, Elim
and 97 Cardassian civilians.

512
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:32,306
You can't be serious.

513
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:34,400
l followed my orders.

514
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:39,506
None of those prisoners
escaped off of Bajor alive.

515
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:42,450
Unfortunately,
as it turned out

516
00:23:42,485 --> 00:23:45,147
one of the passengers
on the shuttle was the daughter

517
00:23:45,188 --> 00:23:46,815
of a prominent
military official.

518
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:49,791
l was stripped of my rank
and commission

519
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:54,923
and exiled from Cardassia.

520
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:58,365
So, now you know, Doctor.

521
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:04,897
l hope... l haven't shattered
too many of your illusions.

522
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,202
Listen to me, Garak.

523
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:13,773
Right now, l'm not concerned
with what you did in the past.

524
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:17,252
l'm simply not going to walk
out of here and let you die.

525
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:19,481
We need to turn
that implant off

526
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:21,820
and whatever withdrawal symptoms

527
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:23,985
or side effects
you may experience

528
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:28,122
l promise l'll help
you through them.

529
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:32,362
l need to know where
that triggering device is.

530
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:34,733
Where is it?

531
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:39,405
The desk, second drawer.

532
00:24:58,294 --> 00:24:59,989
Well, that will be all for now.

533
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:02,020
lf you need to reach me,
l'll be here

534
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:03,793
for at least the next 26 hours.

535
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,630
Computer, l'm reading
an ongoing erosion

536
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:08,432
of tissue in the patient's
lymphatic system. Explain.

537
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:11,440
Unable to determine a cause
due to insufficient data

538
00:25:11,474 --> 00:25:13,942
on Cardassian physiology.

539
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:15,170
All right.

540
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:16,439
Continue to monitor the status

541
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,844
of the patient's
cranial implant.

542
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,848
lnform me if it shows
any sign of reactivation.

543
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:22,477
Yes?

544
00:25:22,518 --> 00:25:24,315
Doctor.

545
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:27,345
l was hoping l could ask Garak
some questions.

546
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,755
He's asleep.

547
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:30,986
He has been ever since
l turned off his implant.

548
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:34,656
Now, come on,
we can talk outside.

549
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:36,426
Doctor, l need to talk to him
as soon as possible.

550
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:38,990
l have four cases left
in my homicide files

551
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:41,333
which l'm almost certain
were committed

552
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,667
by the Obsidian Order.

553
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:43,967
lf Garak was a member

554
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:46,497
he may be able
to shed some light on them.

555
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:48,635
l'm afraid your questions
will have to wait.

556
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:50,339
How long?

557
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:51,573
l don't know yet.

558
00:25:51,614 --> 00:25:54,742
Constable, Garak's body
has undergone a severe shock.

559
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:56,649
l don't know
when he'll recover.

560
00:25:56,686 --> 00:25:59,382
l'm not even sure
if he'll recover.

561
00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:01,788
ln that case,
l want to talk to him now.

562
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:02,791
Wake him up.

563
00:26:02,825 --> 00:26:03,951
l'll do no such thing.

564
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,394
Doctor, these are murder cases,
and Garak may be a suspect.

565
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:10,922
That may be so,
but he's still my patient

566
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:12,901
and l'll not have him disturbed.

567
00:26:12,935 --> 00:26:15,529
So, until further notice,
his quarters are off limits

568
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:17,698
to everyone except emergency
medical personnel.

569
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,005
So, if you'll excuse me,
l have a patient to attend to.

570
00:27:56,672 --> 00:27:57,850
Garak?

571
00:27:57,983 --> 00:27:58,972
Leave me alone.

572
00:27:59,084 --> 00:28:00,745
l don't think that would be
a good idea right now.

573
00:28:00,786 --> 00:28:02,811
Your blood chemistry
is severely imbalanced.

574
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:04,049
You need to rest.

575
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:05,556
Don't touch me.

576
00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:06,888
Just calm down.

577
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:09,895
l don't want to calm down,
Doctor.

578
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:12,329
l've been calm long enough.

579
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:14,059
Look at this place.

580
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:15,566
lt's pathetic.

581
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:19,401
To think that this is what
my life has been reduced to.

582
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:23,374
This sterile shell,
this... prison.

583
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:24,637
Take it easy, Garak.

584
00:28:24,677 --> 00:28:26,941
Look, you're obviously
experiencing some side effects

585
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:29,243
from the deactivation
of the implant.

586
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:30,407
Ridiculous.

587
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:31,939
l feel more clearheaded

588
00:28:31,984 --> 00:28:34,214
than l have
in the past two years.

589
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:40,384
Two years-- what a waste
these past two years have been.

590
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,291
There was a time, Doctor.

591
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:46,355
Oh! There was a time
when l was a power.

592
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,299
The protégé
of Enabran Tain himself.

593
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:52,202
Do you have any idea
what that means?

594
00:28:52,237 --> 00:28:53,636
l'm afraid l don't.

595
00:28:53,672 --> 00:28:55,071
No, you don't, do you?

596
00:28:55,107 --> 00:28:57,132
You don't know much of anything.

597
00:28:57,176 --> 00:28:58,939
Tain was the Obsidian Order.

598
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:02,072
Not even the Central Command
dared challenge him

599
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:04,048
and l was his right hand.

600
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,607
My future was limitless

601
00:29:05,651 --> 00:29:08,552
until l threw it away.

602
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:10,521
You mean when you had
that shuttle shot down

603
00:29:10,556 --> 00:29:12,217
to stop those prisoners
from escaping?

604
00:29:12,257 --> 00:29:13,315
Stopped them.

605
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,917
l only wish
that l had stopped them.

606
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,222
You didn't?

607
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:19,162
No, Doctor, my disgrace
is worse than that.

608
00:29:19,198 --> 00:29:20,495
Unimaginably worse.

609
00:29:20,532 --> 00:29:23,899
What could you have
possibly done worse than that?

610
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:26,404
l let them go.

611
00:29:26,438 --> 00:29:30,067
lt was the eve
of the Cardassian withdrawal.

612
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:33,476
Elim and l were
interrogating five Bajorans.

613
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:35,412
They were children, Doctor!

614
00:29:35,447 --> 00:29:38,041
None of them were older
than 14 years old.

615
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:39,243
They knew nothing.

616
00:29:39,284 --> 00:29:41,184
They lived in bombed-out rooms

617
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,347
scrounged for food
on the streets.

618
00:29:43,389 --> 00:29:45,380
They were filthy and they stank.

619
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:50,157
The room was freezing cold,
the air was like ice

620
00:29:50,195 --> 00:29:54,063
and suddenly the whole exercise
seemed utterly meaningless.

621
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:58,502
All l wanted was a hot bath
and a good meal.

622
00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:04,932
And so l let them go.

623
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:07,445
l gave them whatever latinum
l had in my pockets

624
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:08,468
and opened the door

625
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:11,347
and flung them back
into the streets.

626
00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:13,544
Elim couldn't believe his eyes.

627
00:30:13,585 --> 00:30:17,316
He looked at me
as if l were insane.

628
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:19,153
You took pity on those children.

629
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:21,216
There's nothing wrong with that.

630
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,420
No! l was a fool!

631
00:30:22,461 --> 00:30:24,986
l should have completed
my interrogation

632
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:28,227
and turned them over
to the troops for execution

633
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:31,634
but because l was chilly
and my stomach was growling

634
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,898
l failed in my duty

635
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:35,634
and destroyed everything
l had worked for.

636
00:30:35,674 --> 00:30:37,835
And so they exiled you.

637
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,503
That's right.

638
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:45,450
And left me to live out my days
with nothing to look forward to

639
00:30:45,484 --> 00:30:47,850
but having lunch with you.

640
00:30:47,886 --> 00:30:50,013
Well, l'm sorry
you feel that way.

641
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,614
l thought
you enjoyed my company.

642
00:30:52,658 --> 00:30:55,422
Oh, l did,
and that's the worst part.

643
00:30:55,461 --> 00:30:58,487
l can't believe
that l actually enjoyed

644
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,122
eating mediocre food

645
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:03,862
and staring into your
smug, sanctimonious face.

646
00:31:03,902 --> 00:31:08,930
l hate this place,
and l hate you.

647
00:31:08,974 --> 00:31:11,568
Okay, Garak,
that's your prerogative.

648
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,943
Now, l really think
you should lie down.

649
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,777
Get away from me!

650
00:31:16,815 --> 00:31:18,146
Garak...

651
00:31:24,823 --> 00:31:26,085
Garak, stop this.

652
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,320
l don't want to hurt you.

653
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:34,799
Bashir to lnfirmary.

654
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:38,325
l need an emergency medical team
in Garak's quarters now.

655
00:31:42,508 --> 00:31:45,341
Administer another
20cc's of hyperzine.

656
00:31:47,012 --> 00:31:47,979
He's not responding.

657
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:49,002
Give it a second.

658
00:31:49,047 --> 00:31:51,447
Begin cardio-stimulation.

659
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:53,915
His heartbeat is stabilizing.

660
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:55,943
But his lymphatic system
is still critical.

661
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:57,046
l don't understand it.

662
00:31:58,857 --> 00:31:59,824
l shut down the implant.

663
00:31:59,858 --> 00:32:01,587
lt can't be affecting
his blood chemistry.

664
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:03,527
Yet toxins are
still accumulating

665
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:05,689
in his lymphatic tissues.

666
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:09,064
Computer, display analysis
of all biochemical samples

667
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:11,865
taken from the patient
in the past 39 hours.

668
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:15,465
Display them
by chemical composition.

669
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:20,342
lsolate and display
sample number... 17.

670
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:25,611
Bring up sample 23.

671
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:27,881
Sample 27.

672
00:32:29,354 --> 00:32:31,015
Sample 32.

673
00:32:32,357 --> 00:32:34,518
Sample 35.

674
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:36,892
Sample 40.

675
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:38,487
Stop.

676
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,226
Bring back sample 35.

677
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:45,596
Superimpose the molecular
structure of this leukocyte

678
00:32:45,637 --> 00:32:47,901
with an analogous sample
taken from yesterday.

679
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:52,541
That's it.

680
00:32:52,578 --> 00:32:54,512
The molecular structure
of Garak's leukocytes

681
00:32:54,546 --> 00:32:55,513
has been altered.

682
00:32:55,547 --> 00:32:56,673
That must be what's causing

683
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:58,410
the accumulation
of toxins in his system.

684
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,213
Can we synthesize
Cardassian leukocytes?

685
00:33:00,252 --> 00:33:01,776
Probably, but that
could take weeks

686
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,287
and we don't have
that much time.

687
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:04,880
We have three
or four days at most.

688
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:06,288
lf we turned
the implant back on

689
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:07,724
we might be able
to keep him alive

690
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,726
another week or two.

691
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,727
No.

692
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:10,750
What?

693
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:16,093
l won't allow it.

694
00:33:16,134 --> 00:33:18,796
l never want that thing
turned on again.

695
00:33:18,837 --> 00:33:20,464
l understand how you feel

696
00:33:20,505 --> 00:33:23,406
but l'm not sure what
else l can do for you.

697
00:33:23,442 --> 00:33:28,277
Oh, you've done enough, Doctor,
more than l deserve.

698
00:33:28,313 --> 00:33:31,544
There's something
you have to know.

699
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,983
What's that?

700
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,078
The truth.

701
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:42,992
l've about given up on learning
the truth from you, Garak.

702
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:46,361
Oh, don't give up
on me now, Doctor.

703
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:48,798
Patience has its rewards.

704
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:51,428
Now listen carefully.

705
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,904
Elim wasn't my aide.

706
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:58,239
He was... my friend.

707
00:33:58,277 --> 00:33:59,835
We grew up together.

708
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:02,176
We were closer than brothers.

709
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:06,048
For some reason Enabran Tain
took a liking to us.

710
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:08,075
Before long, we were both

711
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,248
very powerful men
in the Obsidian Order.

712
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,952
They called us
''the sons of Tain.''

713
00:34:13,992 --> 00:34:17,052
Even the Guls feared us.

714
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:19,256
And then there was a scandal.

715
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:21,732
Someone in the Order was accused

716
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,793
of letting some Bajoran
prisoners escape.

717
00:34:24,836 --> 00:34:29,432
There were constant rumors of
who was going to be implicated.

718
00:34:29,474 --> 00:34:32,170
Fingers were being pointed
at me.

719
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,374
By then, Tain had retired
to the Arawath Colony.

720
00:34:36,415 --> 00:34:40,943
He couldn't protect me,
so l panicked.

721
00:34:40,986 --> 00:34:43,546
l did everything in my power

722
00:34:43,588 --> 00:34:48,082
to make sure that Elim
was accused instead of me.

723
00:34:48,126 --> 00:34:51,846
l altered records,
planted evidence

724
00:34:51,979 --> 00:34:55,710
only to discover
that he'd beaten me to it.

725
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,844
Well, he betrayed you first.

726
00:34:58,886 --> 00:35:00,945
Elim destroyed me.

727
00:35:00,988 --> 00:35:07,723
Before l knew what was going on,
l was sentenced to exile.

728
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,529
And the irony is, l deserved it.

729
00:35:12,566 --> 00:35:16,297
Oh, not for the reasons
they claimed

730
00:35:16,337 --> 00:35:22,867
but because of what l had tried
to do to Elim, my best friend.

731
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:26,209
Why are you telling me this,
Garak?

732
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:30,206
So that you can forgive me.

733
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:31,548
Why else?

734
00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:37,956
l need to know
that someone forgives me.

735
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:47,063
l forgive you...

736
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,934
for whatever it is you did.

737
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:52,666
Thank you, Doctor.

738
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:55,369
That's most kind.

739
00:36:03,217 --> 00:36:04,878
See that he rests comfortably.

740
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:06,681
l'll be back within 52 hours.

741
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:08,518
Where are you going?

742
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:11,889
To find the man
responsible for this.

743
00:36:58,205 --> 00:36:59,832
Dr. Bashir.

744
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:01,671
Welcome.

745
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:03,768
Please, make yourself at home.

746
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:13,012
Well, Doctor, you've come
all this way to see me.

747
00:37:13,054 --> 00:37:14,988
Aren't you going
to say something?

748
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:16,751
How did you know my name?

749
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:19,521
lnformation's my business.

750
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,028
You're Enabran Tain.

751
00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:24,429
And you're
Dr. Julian Subatoi Bashir.

752
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:26,865
l hope you weren't
greeted too rudely

753
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:28,892
upon entering Cardassian space.

754
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:31,598
Not nearly as rudely
as l expected.

755
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:34,631
Good, l alerted them
that you'd be coming.

756
00:37:34,675 --> 00:37:36,768
The military hates surprises.

757
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:39,245
Still, what you did
was very brave.

758
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,474
l'm impressed.

759
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:43,381
Can l get you
something to drink?

760
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:44,884
Tarkalean tea, perhaps?

761
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:48,446
l always drink Tarkalean... tea.

762
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:51,481
A good host knows
the needs of his guests.

763
00:37:51,525 --> 00:37:55,222
One Tarkalean tea, extra sweet.

764
00:37:55,262 --> 00:37:57,321
And a glass of <i>kanar.</i>

765
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,429
So, Lieutenant, how's Garak?

766
00:38:05,473 --> 00:38:08,033
Has his condition
improved at all?

767
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:12,069
That Cardassian Quark
was talking to, Boheeka

768
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:14,013
l suppose he really did have

769
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:16,482
a reason to fear
the Obsidian Order.

770
00:38:16,517 --> 00:38:19,611
Everyone has reason
to fear the Order.

771
00:38:19,653 --> 00:38:20,711
l don't understand it.

772
00:38:20,754 --> 00:38:22,278
Garak told me you were retired.

773
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:23,517
Oh, l am.

774
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:24,785
Have been for years.

775
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:27,555
But l try to keep informed
on current events.

776
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:29,028
l bet you could tell me

777
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:31,827
all kinds of things
l'd like to know, Doctor.

778
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:32,992
Oh, l'm sure l could.

779
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:35,661
l'll tell you anything
you want to know

780
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:38,069
about medicine,
biology, or tennis.

781
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:40,164
Do you want to hear my opinion

782
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:42,698
on the latest nillimite
alloy racket?

783
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:44,870
l don't think
that would be necessary.

784
00:38:44,912 --> 00:38:46,209
Have it your way.

785
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:48,715
Are all the Starfleet
Lieutenants

786
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:50,307
as brash as you are?

787
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:52,114
l couldn't say.

788
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:54,314
Though l doubt it.

789
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:55,447
So do l.

790
00:38:55,489 --> 00:39:00,392
Tell me, Doctor,
how sick is Garak?

791
00:39:00,427 --> 00:39:02,327
He's dying.

792
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:04,058
And you're trying to save him.

793
00:39:04,098 --> 00:39:05,122
That's right.

794
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,133
Strange.

795
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:08,965
l thought you were his friend.

796
00:39:10,204 --> 00:39:11,967
l suppose l am.

797
00:39:12,006 --> 00:39:14,031
Then you should let him die.

798
00:39:14,074 --> 00:39:18,170
After all, for Garak, a life
in exile is no life at all.

799
00:39:18,212 --> 00:39:22,842
Say what you will,
my job is to keep him alive

800
00:39:22,883 --> 00:39:25,044
and l need your help.

801
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:27,519
My help?
What can l do?

802
00:39:27,555 --> 00:39:30,046
The molecular structure
of Garak's leukocytes

803
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,148
has been disrupted.

804
00:39:31,192 --> 00:39:33,023
l need to synthesize
replacements

805
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,028
in order to stabilize
his condition.

806
00:39:35,062 --> 00:39:38,122
Unfortunately, my knowledge
of Cardassian biochemistry

807
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:39,598
is severely limited.

808
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:42,898
And you think l have access
to that kind of information?

809
00:39:42,937 --> 00:39:45,462
lnformation is your business.

810
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:48,031
Besides,
you're the one who ordered him

811
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:50,134
to put that implant in his head,
aren't you?

812
00:39:50,177 --> 00:39:52,839
l never had to order Garak
to do anything.

813
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,041
That's what made him special.

814
00:39:55,082 --> 00:39:56,413
So you're saying that

815
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,544
if you don't get the
information, Garak dies.

816
00:39:59,587 --> 00:40:00,713
That's it.

817
00:40:00,754 --> 00:40:03,154
Well, we can't
allow that, can we?

818
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,384
l'll see to it

819
00:40:04,425 --> 00:40:07,394
that all the necessary
data is transferred

820
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:09,396
to your station's computers.

821
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,590
Thank you.

822
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:12,792
Oh, don't thank me.

823
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:15,267
l'm not doing Garak any favors.

824
00:40:15,302 --> 00:40:17,827
He doesn't deserve
a quick death.

825
00:40:17,871 --> 00:40:22,740
On the contrary, l want to him
to live a long, miserable life.

826
00:40:22,776 --> 00:40:25,745
l want him to grow old
on that station

827
00:40:25,779 --> 00:40:28,077
surrounded by people
who hate him

828
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:31,346
knowing that he'll
never come home again.

829
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:34,479
What a lovely sentiment.

830
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:37,888
And it's from the heart,
l assure you.

831
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:42,589
And now, Doctor, l really
think you should be going.

832
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,790
One last thing.

833
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:45,264
Make it brief.

834
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:48,462
Garak mentioned an old friend
of his the other day--

835
00:40:48,502 --> 00:40:50,333
a member
of the Obsidian Order.

836
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:52,635
l was wondering
what happened to him.

837
00:40:52,673 --> 00:40:55,437
Did he give you
the name of this friend?

838
00:40:55,476 --> 00:40:57,603
He said it was Elim.

839
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,848
Elim.

840
00:41:01,882 --> 00:41:03,782
Mind letting me in on the joke?

841
00:41:03,817 --> 00:41:06,377
l can see that Garak
hasn't changed a bit.

842
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,911
Never tell the truth
when a lie will do.

843
00:41:09,023 --> 00:41:12,618
That man has a rare gift
for obfuscation.

844
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,097
Doctor, Elim is
Garak's first name.

845
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:19,857
Now run along home.

846
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,394
And please, tell Garak
that l miss him.

847
00:41:26,106 --> 00:41:30,736
l'll be sure
to give him the message.

848
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:34,111
Computer, one to beam up.

849
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:38,949
Energize.

850
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:02,837
May l join you?

851
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:03,865
Garak.

852
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:06,379
Thank you.

853
00:42:08,415 --> 00:42:10,110
What are you doing up?

854
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,920
You're supposed to be in bed.

855
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:13,680
Out of the question.

856
00:42:13,722 --> 00:42:16,452
l couldn't stand being cooped up

857
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:19,517
in that dreadful lnfirmary
for another second.

858
00:42:19,561 --> 00:42:21,859
Besides, l feel perfectly fine.

859
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:25,525
So, how's the l'danian
spice pudding today?

860
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:28,832
How's the spice pudding?

861
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,862
ls that all you have
to say for yourself?

862
00:42:31,906 --> 00:42:33,168
How can you just sit there

863
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,768
and pretend that the last
ten days never happened?

864
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,268
l, for one, Doctor,
am perfectly satisfied

865
00:42:39,314 --> 00:42:41,214
with the way things turned out

866
00:42:41,249 --> 00:42:44,741
and l see no need to dwell
on what was, doubtlessly

867
00:42:44,786 --> 00:42:48,244
a difficult time
for both of us.

868
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:52,749
By the way, l just had the
most interesting conversation

869
00:42:52,794 --> 00:42:54,318
with Constable Odo.

870
00:42:54,362 --> 00:42:57,058
lt seems he's
under the impression

871
00:42:57,098 --> 00:43:00,499
that l was a member
of the Obsidian Order.

872
00:43:00,535 --> 00:43:02,127
What did you tell him?

873
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,570
That he was mistaken, of course.

874
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:06,198
And he believed you?

875
00:43:06,241 --> 00:43:07,731
Well, he said something

876
00:43:07,776 --> 00:43:10,802
about keeping a closer eye on me
in the future.

877
00:43:10,845 --> 00:43:14,178
l told him, ''Be my guest.
l have nothing to hide.''

878
00:43:14,215 --> 00:43:17,343
Here, l've brought you
something.

879
00:43:17,385 --> 00:43:18,682
What is it?

880
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,680
<i>Meditations on a Crimson Shadow</i>
by Preloc.

881
00:43:23,725 --> 00:43:26,421
More Cardassian literature.

882
00:43:26,461 --> 00:43:29,021
l think you'll find this one
more to your taste.

883
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,588
lt takes place in the future

884
00:43:30,632 --> 00:43:32,122
during a time when Cardassia

885
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:33,998
and the Klingon Empire
are at war.

886
00:43:34,035 --> 00:43:35,297
Who wins?

887
00:43:35,336 --> 00:43:36,803
Who do you think?

888
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:38,169
Never mind.
Don't tell me.

889
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:40,197
l don't want you
to spoil the ending.

890
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:46,677
You know, l still have
a lot of questions

891
00:43:46,714 --> 00:43:49,239
to ask you about your past.

892
00:43:49,284 --> 00:43:52,515
l've given you all the answers
l'm capable of.

893
00:43:52,554 --> 00:43:54,419
You've given me answers,
all right.

894
00:43:54,456 --> 00:43:55,923
But they were all different.

895
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:59,323
What l want to know is, out of
all the stories you've told me

896
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,760
which ones were true
and which ones weren't?

897
00:44:01,796 --> 00:44:05,664
My dear Doctor,
they're all true.

898
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,032
Even the lies?

899
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:11,197
Especially the lies.
