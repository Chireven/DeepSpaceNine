1
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,922
You know,
if there's anything

2
00:00:11,963 --> 00:00:13,692
l can do for you
while you're here...

3
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:15,528
Oh, you've already
been helpful.

4
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:16,931
Just hearing about Dax
makes me

5
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:18,959
a little less nervous
about the whole thing.

6
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,868
Really? There's no
reason to be nervous.

7
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:22,702
Jadzia will be
a wonderful host...

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,401
Well, that is, she is
a wonderful host

9
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:25,739
in a Trill manner
of speaking.

10
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:27,438
l'm sure you'll learn
a lot from her.

11
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:28,706
She sounds very different

12
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:30,509
from the other Daxes
l have heard about.

13
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:31,515
ln what fashion?

14
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:32,607
Let me put it this way.

15
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,083
When l was told
that Jadzia Dax

16
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:35,745
had been designated
my field docent

17
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:37,880
l asked for reassignment.

18
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,321
You're joking!

19
00:00:39,357 --> 00:00:40,585
Why?

20
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,526
Because Dax is famous
for breaking initiates.

21
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,892
Breaking them?

22
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:47,193
l looked up the records.

23
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,357
Over the past 200 years

24
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,664
Dax has personally
eliminated

25
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:54,035
57 host candidates
from the program.

26
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:58,031
l suppose it's too late
to introduce myself to her.

27
00:00:58,076 --> 00:00:59,737
Too late?
l doubt it.

28
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:01,369
Jadzia's a night owl.

29
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:03,505
Computer,
locate Lieutenant Dax.

30
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:06,574
Lieutenant Dax is on
Level 7, Section 5.

31
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:07,811
Ah, of course.

32
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:10,878
Then take us
to Level 7, Section 5.

33
00:01:10,922 --> 00:01:12,787
That's the computer's way

34
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:15,088
of telling us
she's in Quark's.

35
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:19,126
Over 5,000 candidates

36
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:21,893
qualify for the training
program each year.

37
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:25,027
Only 300 symbionts are
available on the average.

38
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:27,162
lt doesn't take much
for one of us

39
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,068
to get knocked out
of consideration.

40
00:01:29,107 --> 00:01:31,405
The administrators only
want hosts who are...

41
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:33,805
Acquire!

42
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:35,312
Confront!

43
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:41,180
...the best and the brightest.

44
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:42,719
lt's the ears!

45
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:44,654
Every time
he goes to acquire

46
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,556
he scratches behind
his left ear, like this.

47
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:49,184
Don't play with my ears...

48
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:51,386
unless you're
serious about it.

49
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:53,455
Jadzia...

50
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:54,897
you have a guest.

51
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:57,560
Oh, you're not supposed
to be here till tomorrow.

52
00:01:57,602 --> 00:01:59,092
Yes, ma'am.

53
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:01,571
l caught a transport from
Starbase 41 a day early.

54
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:02,766
We found ourselves
sitting

55
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:04,434
next to each other
on the way here.

56
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:06,943
l've been telling
Arjin all about you.

57
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:08,138
Really?

58
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,238
Well, not quite all about you.

59
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:11,942
Do you play <i>tongo,</i> Arjin?

60
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:13,746
<i>Tongo?</i>

61
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:14,945
No, sir.

62
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:17,819
Then you'll have
to leave, Arjin.

63
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:19,823
The risk's to you,
Lieutenant.

64
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:21,757
Shame on you, Quark.

65
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,158
Where are your manners?

66
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:25,253
This is a Trill initiate
you're speaking to.

67
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:27,264
Of course he doesn't
play <i>tongo.</i>

68
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:29,727
l beg your pardon.

69
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:31,598
So, we'll have to teach him.

70
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:33,831
Actually, it is
very easy to learn.

71
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:36,305
How much money did
you bring with you?

72
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,171
Give the young fellow
a seat.

73
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,506
You, out!

74
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:41,034
lt was a very long trip.

75
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,773
l think perhaps
l should...

76
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,577
Oh, of course,
you're tired.

77
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:46,583
l'll take you
to your quarters.

78
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:47,982
Roll me away, fellows.

79
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,350
We can't roll you away.

80
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:50,718
They're sore losers.

81
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:54,020
You can't quit now.
You just won!

82
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:56,219
Female!

83
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:17,209
Yes?

84
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:18,907
Oh... l'm sorry.

85
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:22,246
l thought this was
Lieutenant Dax's quarters.

86
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:24,514
She's in the shower.

87
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:26,817
Oh... well, uh,
in that case...

88
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:28,618
ls she expecting you?

89
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:30,318
Yes, my name is Arjin.

90
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:32,623
She told me l should
be here at 0800...

91
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:33,923
ls that Arjin?

92
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:35,395
You're early again, Arjin.

93
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,091
We're going to have
to work on that.

94
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,461
l can come back.

95
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,933
Don't be silly.
Come in.

96
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,401
l'll only be a minute.

97
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:43,734
lt always takes me longer
to get ready as a female.

98
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:44,966
l have to go.

99
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,975
l have to be at Caledonia lV
by tomorrow.

100
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:48,499
When's my rematch?

101
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:50,102
Oh, l'll be back next week.

102
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:53,580
lt was fun.
Brutal, but fun.

103
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:55,105
Safe trip!

104
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,983
The replicator makes
a decent citrus blend.

105
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,114
Thanks, but l've already
had something to eat.

106
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:02,885
Would you get me a Black Hole?

107
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,290
A what?

108
00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:06,794
A Black Hole--
it's a Ferengi drink.

109
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:10,265
A bartender l've known
for a hundred years

110
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:12,199
introduced it to Curzon.

111
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:13,496
Or was it Lela?

112
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:14,968
Well, it was ages ago.

113
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:16,766
Try one.
You might like it.

114
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:19,000
Computer, black hole.

115
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,805
Oh, my muscles
are so sore.

116
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:24,710
Did you ever wrestle

117
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:27,078
Galeo-Manada style,
Arjin?

118
00:06:27,182 --> 00:06:28,080
Wrestle?

119
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:29,241
You should.

120
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:30,911
lt's a great way
to start the day.

121
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:32,250
lt makes you more alert.

122
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:33,845
l'll set you up with Trajok.

123
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,447
He's a great coach.

124
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,481
Okay.

125
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:41,489
Mmm... better.

126
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,498
So, you don't play <i>tongo...</i>

127
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:44,863
you don't wrestle.

128
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,334
What are we going
to do while you're here?

129
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,394
Well, l was
under the impression

130
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:51,065
that field training
consisted of...

131
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,630
l know all about
field training.

132
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:55,370
Jadzia went through it
a few years ago.

133
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,002
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:06:58,413 --> 00:07:01,382
Arjin, if you truly want
to become a Trill host someday

135
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,543
you'll never call me
''ma'am'' again.

136
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:05,849
Yes... Lieutenant.

137
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:09,416
Why don't you try ''Jadzia''?

138
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:13,723
lf you think
that's appropriate.

139
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:18,490
Oh, l'm sure it isn't
appropriate at all.

140
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,297
But then, l hate
to be appropriate.

141
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:32,674
Nothing!

142
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,874
Ah!

143
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,819
Over here, Chief.

144
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:56,536
No.

145
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:59,472
All right, come to Papa.

146
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:01,635
Major?

147
00:08:01,677 --> 00:08:03,167
Voles, sir.

148
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:04,508
Voles?

149
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:06,639
A Cardassian legacy.

150
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:08,047
They weren't bothering us

151
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,813
till we started moving
into areas of the station

152
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:12,479
that they've been hiding in.

153
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:16,548
Now they're spreading
out all over the place.

154
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:20,891
They seem to be attracted
to electromagnetic fields.

155
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,920
Give me a hand,
Major, will you?

156
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:26,434
Phasers on stun,
Mr. O'Brien.

157
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:29,631
l want those voles taken alive.

158
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,639
Benjamin, l'd like
you to meet Arjin

159
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:33,834
the host candidate
l told you about.

160
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,308
Commander Benjamin Sisko.

161
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:36,470
Sir.

162
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:38,035
And that's our First Officer

163
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,742
Major Kira,
and Chief Engineer O'Brien

164
00:08:40,782 --> 00:08:42,750
conducting repairs?

165
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:44,877
Chasing Cardassian voles.

166
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,080
Really?

167
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:48,213
l've never seen
a Cardassian vole.

168
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:49,484
Oh...

169
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:51,014
be my guest.

170
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:56,931
So, you're the one
who picked the black marble.

171
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:57,989
Sir?

172
00:08:58,033 --> 00:08:59,466
Field training with Dax

173
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:01,662
was the nightmare
of the initiate corps.

174
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:03,068
That was Curzon Dax.

175
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:05,039
Gotcha!

176
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:06,938
Arjin, here.

177
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:25,492
Spectacular, isn't it?

178
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:28,121
Uh... it's amazing.

179
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:39,235
Computer, play something
by Frenchotte.

180
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:40,332
Frenchotte?

181
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,933
A self-exiled Romulan.

182
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:43,501
l collect forgotten composers.

183
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:46,577
You feel like taking
the controls?

184
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:48,845
l've never flown
a Federation runabout before.

185
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:50,681
These things practically
fly themselves.

186
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:53,984
You have third-level
flight experience, don't you?

187
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:57,389
Actually, l just finished
my fifth level last month.

188
00:09:57,426 --> 00:09:59,792
Fifth! l didn't
finish third until...

189
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:01,523
Your last year of training.

190
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:03,497
You've been studying up
on me, Arjin.

191
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:05,523
Well, l can't say
that l blame you.

192
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,660
l did the same thing
when l found out

193
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:09,795
who my field docent
was going to be.

194
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:12,363
And how did you feel
when you found out

195
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:14,034
it was going to be
Curzon Dax?

196
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:17,568
''Nauseous'' might be
the best description.

197
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:21,048
l suppose it wouldn't be fair
for you to give me a few tips.

198
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,516
Tips?

199
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:24,883
On how you managed
to impress him.

200
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,388
Look, let's get
one thing straight.

201
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:30,391
l'm not Curzon or Lela
or any of the others.

202
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:31,915
l'm Jadzia Dax.

203
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,451
Jadzia is only a few years
older than you are.

204
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:37,124
You're her first initiate.

205
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,292
To be honest,
in a lot of ways

206
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:41,859
l still feel
like an initiate, myself.

207
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:45,236
l can still remember
the pressure of competition

208
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:47,537
when Jadzia was going
through it.

209
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:51,012
And l'm not going
to make this difficult for you.

210
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:53,776
You don't have
to impress me, okay?

211
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:57,342
-Okay.
-Okay.

212
00:10:57,385 --> 00:10:59,182
So, how did you?

213
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:02,552
lmpress him?

214
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:03,990
l didn't.

215
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:07,756
Curzon recommended that my
initiate period be terminated.

216
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:13,560
l've got it!
Engaging manual stabilizers.

217
00:11:13,602 --> 00:11:15,331
Shutting down all engines.

218
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,497
Computer,
analyze stability loss.

219
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:20,064
Stability loss
was due to an impact

220
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:22,508
by a subspace interphase pocket.

221
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:24,307
Nature of interphase pocket?

222
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:25,574
Unknown.

223
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:27,411
Damage report.

224
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:29,679
Starboard nacelle
nonfunctional.

225
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:32,209
Maximum available power
50 percent.

226
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:35,087
Jadzia...

227
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:37,523
you better
take a look at this.

228
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:42,921
Looks like we
snagged something

229
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:44,454
from that subspace pocket.

230
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:47,866
Computer, identify mass
on the starboard nacelle.

231
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:50,337
Unknown.

232
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:06,704
Maybe we could create

233
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:08,641
some kind of EM pathway
along the inner hull

234
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:10,076
and try to lure them
into a trap.

235
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,544
Uh-huh, but how
could you do that

236
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,843
without shutting down all
the other power systems?

237
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:16,214
l can't, and it would take
days to round them all up.

238
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:18,776
We'd have to evacuate
the station.

239
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,084
The only other thing
l can come up with

240
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:23,749
is a directional
sonic generator.

241
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,783
Now, l can adjust
it to a frequency

242
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:27,488
that'll be uncomfortable
to their ears

243
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,554
and drive them
out of hiding, one at a time.

244
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:31,258
But, at that rate,
l'll be doing this

245
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:32,766
for the rest
of my tour of duty.

246
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:35,668
lt ran right across
a dabo table!

247
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,467
How did it die?

248
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:38,938
Get into your food?

249
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:42,099
As landlords,
you're responsible for this.

250
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,509
l expect vermin control,
or l'm going to have to...

251
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,947
Leave?
Oh, please say, ''Leave.''

252
00:12:47,982 --> 00:12:51,543
l'd take a Cardassian vole
over you any day.

253
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:54,785
The girl insists
on fighting

254
00:12:54,823 --> 00:12:56,154
her latent attraction to me.

255
00:12:57,158 --> 00:12:59,558
What are you going to do
about these pests, O'Brien?

256
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:00,993
Relax, Quark.

257
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:02,326
We're working on something new

258
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,332
that ought to make the voles
beg for mercy.

259
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,458
What is it?

260
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,798
Well, a sonic...

261
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,167
Stop!

262
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,513
You all right?

263
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:21,447
Are you all right?

264
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:22,643
What?

265
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:24,242
Chief, the <i>Mekong</i>
just came back

266
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:25,616
through the wormhole.

267
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:27,086
They're showing damage.

268
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:28,315
Open a channel, Major.

269
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:29,584
Put them on screen.

270
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:30,682
Are you all right, Dax?

271
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:32,625
Our power reserves are gone.

272
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,684
We could use a tow.

273
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:34,717
What happened?

274
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:35,991
Not exactly sure.

275
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,055
We picked up some kind
of subspace seaweed

276
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,498
on our starboard nacelle.

277
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:42,401
We couldn't get rid of it
without causing further damage.

278
00:13:42,437 --> 00:13:44,405
You can shut down your
engines, Lieutenant.

279
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:45,667
We'll bring you into Pad D.

280
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:47,766
Set up a containment chamber
in the Science Lab

281
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:48,867
for me, would you, Chief?

282
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,275
When we get this thing
untangled

283
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:52,677
l'd like to study it
under controlled conditions.

284
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:54,306
We'll need a couple of hours.

285
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:55,543
Morning will be fine.

286
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,574
That'll give Arjin and me
a little time to recoup.

287
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:58,745
Acknowledged.

288
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:00,220
Stop by and fill me in later.

289
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:01,279
<i>Mekong</i> out.

290
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:05,056
Come on, l'll take
you to dinner.

291
00:14:14,836 --> 00:14:19,967
<i>Ak'la bella Doo-oo</i>

292
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:24,377
<i>bella Ak'la Doo-oo</i>

293
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:28,815
<i>la suhm la suhm</i>

294
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,810
<i>l'Kahtra la suhm...</i>

295
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:42,263
<i>Ak'la bella Doo-oo!</i>

296
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:46,364
She taught that to me.

297
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:47,663
Can you believe it?

298
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:49,636
A Klingon song
l'd never heard.

299
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:52,936
She collects
lost composers.

300
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:55,238
<i>Ak un lach'tel?</i>

301
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:57,870
<i>Doko, Doko,</i>
<i>un Koliay Trill.</i>

302
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:02,243
Don't get any ideas.

303
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:03,807
She's mine.

304
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:10,215
You haven't touched your <i>racht.</i>

305
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:11,589
No, l have.

306
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:13,491
lt's interesting.

307
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:16,224
No, you've moved it
around your plate

308
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:19,165
to make it look like
you've touched it.

309
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,067
l didn't have to move it.
lt moved itself.

310
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:24,400
Arjin, if this didn't
appeal to you

311
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,304
why didn't you say something?

312
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:28,309
No, it's all right.

313
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:31,335
l wasn't really
very hungry, anyway.

314
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:35,042
Speak up for yourself
while you're here, okay?

315
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,551
l'll make a concerted effort.

316
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:44,317
So... who sponsored you
for the program?

317
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,293
My father.

318
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:48,261
Was he joined?

319
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:51,697
No, but he had great
ambitions for his children.

320
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:55,897
He was a pilot instructor
at the Gedana post for 40 years.

321
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:57,336
He died last year.

322
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,569
l see where you got
your flight skills.

323
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:02,803
My sister was always
his choice for joining

324
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:05,005
but after she got accepted
to the program

325
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:06,570
she ran off and got married.

326
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:08,980
My father never
spoke to her again.

327
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:13,716
On the day that he died,
he turned to me, and he said

328
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:15,780
''l'm counting on you.''

329
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:19,054
His last words to me.

330
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:23,286
Did he want you to enter
Starfleet after joining?

331
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,390
To put your flight training
to good use?

332
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:30,162
Honestly, he couldn't care less
what l did afterwards

333
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:31,967
as long as l became joined.

334
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:34,338
That was his only goal.

335
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,208
And what about your goals?

336
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:43,077
There are so many possibilities
when you're joined.

337
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:45,312
l'm not sure what l'd do yet.

338
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:47,253
l figured l'd get
a lot of guidance

339
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:49,279
from the symbiont,
wouldn't you say?

340
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:51,656
Well, a symbiont's
influence is

341
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:54,753
very strong, Arjin,
but you're the host.

342
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:56,730
You've got to be
strong enough

343
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:59,961
to balance that influence
with your own instincts.

344
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:03,801
lf you can't, the symbiont
will overwhelm your personality.

345
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:13,280
Oh, they are a nuisance,
aren't they?

346
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:15,874
l was hoping you found
a way to deal with them.

347
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,784
Federation technology
isn't up to the task, eh?

348
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,583
Look, l just thought
in the interests

349
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,055
of good relations,
you might...

350
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:25,024
You've got the station.
You've got the voles.

351
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,460
By the way, their mating season
begins in about six weeks.

352
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:29,895
Thanks for your help.

353
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:33,059
The Federation could always
withdraw from Baj...

354
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,698
What's this?

355
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:38,296
Got me.
lt's from Julian.

356
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,604
He called it the solution
you've been looking for.

357
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:46,907
''lt worked in Hamlin.''

358
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:51,880
Very funny.

359
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:00,922
Your move.

360
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:04,022
Your seaweed's been safely
transported to the Science Lab.

361
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:05,827
Did you take a look at it?

362
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,630
Mm-hmm.
What do you think?

363
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,638
We did as much analysis
on the runabout as we could.

364
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,037
None of the
matter would scan.

365
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:13,438
We'll do more tests tomorrow.

366
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:16,500
How did your initiate come
through the experience?

367
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:17,806
Fine.

368
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:19,506
He's a good pilot.

369
00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:20,514
Uh-oh.

370
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:21,606
What?

371
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:22,673
l know that look.

372
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:24,309
What look?

373
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:25,910
That look, old man.

374
00:18:25,953 --> 00:18:27,045
The one that says

375
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:29,385
''This one isn't
going to make it.''

376
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:31,654
Not because of me.

377
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,786
But you have your doubts.

378
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:35,056
l have my doubts.

379
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:36,289
What is his problem?

380
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,423
l'm not sure what
he brings as a host

381
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:41,629
how he'll advance a symbiont
to the next level.

382
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:44,263
Frankly, he's more than
a little arrogant, Benjamin.

383
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:45,636
ls he?

384
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:47,641
Okay, for a Trill,
that's to be expected.

385
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:49,905
Check. But he's riding
his father's ambitions

386
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:51,343
and he doesn't have any idea

387
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:53,574
what he'd do with a symbiont
if he got one.

388
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:55,741
Have you confronted him?

389
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:58,684
lt's not my job
to confront him.

390
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,779
lsn't it?

391
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:02,983
My job is to show him
what it's like

392
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:05,686
to function as a joined
Trill-- that's all.

393
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,592
l can show you
the guidelines.

394
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:08,822
They're very clear.

395
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:10,252
Mm-hmm.

396
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:14,717
Who am l to confront him?

397
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:18,824
You're Dax.

398
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,488
Yes, but l'm not Curzon Dax

399
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,933
and l won't do to him
what Curzon did to me.

400
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:28,959
So...

401
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:30,835
what are you going to do?

402
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:35,507
This kid has
to measure up soon

403
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:37,978
or he'll never be chosen.

404
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:40,842
True?

405
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:43,112
So, you're not
doing him any favors

406
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:45,619
by avoiding
a confrontation, are you?

407
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:49,283
Curzon was tough--

408
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:52,452
maybe even abusive
in his own charming way--

409
00:19:52,494 --> 00:19:54,018
but he always demanded

410
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:56,620
the highest standards
of excellence

411
00:19:56,665 --> 00:19:58,656
from these host candidates.

412
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,998
You don't know
what he did to me.

413
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:03,231
l know you made it
through the program.

414
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:06,433
No thanks to him.

415
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:08,772
Are you sure?

416
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:49,049
Voles have eaten through the
security field's energy lines.

417
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:51,814
No telling how long it will
take me to set up another field.

418
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:54,447
So, nothing is secure
on this station anymore?

419
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:55,820
ls there any reason
to believe

420
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:57,518
there's an imminent threat
from this?

421
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,221
Not as far as l can tell,
but l can't tell you a lot yet.

422
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:02,025
l want to know
what we're dealing with

423
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,495
as soon as possible.

424
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:05,761
l'll schedule
a briefing for 1400 hours.

425
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,927
And take those phasers
off stun, Chief!

426
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:09,732
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

427
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:13,666
Arjin, how's your
astrophysics profile?

428
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,767
lt's one
of my better subjects.

429
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,177
Maybe that's why l was
sent here to work with you.

430
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:21,580
Set me up
a gravimetric microprobe.

431
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:24,608
l need to calibrate
the energy profile.

432
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:25,950
Jadzia...

433
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:27,978
l felt that last night

434
00:21:28,023 --> 00:21:31,186
maybe l didn't express myself
well about my own goals.

435
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:34,059
l think you expressed
yourself very clearly.

436
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:35,892
l just didn't want you
to think

437
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,160
that l hadn't set any
goals for post-joining.

438
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:40,167
l have thought
about Starfleet.

439
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:43,364
With my flight training,
it would be a perfect...

440
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:45,965
Starfleet is a career.
A pilot is a job.

441
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:48,840
What does that have to do
with being joined?

442
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:51,072
l'm not sure l understand.

443
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:53,080
No, l don't think you do.

444
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:54,443
l'm sorry?

445
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:57,451
l think you're telling me
what l want to hear.

446
00:21:57,485 --> 00:21:58,782
That's not true.

447
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,584
l think you went to your
quarters last night

448
00:22:01,623 --> 00:22:03,648
and you tossed
and turned in bed

449
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:06,160
because you knew
some of the things

450
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:08,185
you said to me concerned me.

451
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:09,924
And now you're
trying to fix it.

452
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:12,125
l'm... l'm just
trying to clarify...

453
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:13,429
l know what it's like.

454
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:15,231
l've tossed and turned myself.

455
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,465
Please don't insult me
by denying it.

456
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,237
l'm finished.

457
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:25,337
Let's run a phase
variant analysis.

458
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:32,578
l'm worried about you, Arjin.

459
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,918
Worried?

460
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:37,254
l'm worried you're not
preparing yourself

461
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:38,725
for being joined.

462
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,057
That's it?

463
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:43,062
A day and a half,
and you've made up your mind.

464
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:44,529
l didn't say that.

465
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:46,500
Look, you've gotten this far

466
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:49,298
by anticipating every demand
of the program

467
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:53,068
and performing above everyone's
expectations, am l right?

468
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:56,043
l'd like to think that's true.

469
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:58,705
And l'm telling you,
from this point on

470
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:01,147
that's not going to be
good enough.

471
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:05,781
Highly structured, but it
doesn't seem to conform

472
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,720
to any of our physical laws.

473
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:10,691
Computer, run a spectral line
profile analysis.

474
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:14,889
Spectral analysis will take
approximately seven minutes.

475
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:18,023
Just to... speak up for myself

476
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:21,728
l'm feeling
a little betrayed here.

477
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,829
l mean, after your impassioned

478
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:27,740
''l am Jadzia, fellow initiate''
speech in the runabout...

479
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:30,176
l understand
why you feel that way

480
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:31,678
but this isn't about me.

481
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:34,409
This is about the standards
for Trill hosts.

482
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:37,213
The opportunity is too rare
and too important

483
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:39,311
to waste on the wrong candidate.

484
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:46,022
And in your mind,
l'm a wrong candidate.

485
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,755
l don't know that yet.

486
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:52,790
But l felt it only fair to let
you know l am worried about you.

487
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:55,963
l see.

488
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,200
l should have known this.

489
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:04,006
l should have realized this.

490
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:06,546
You're Dax.

491
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:09,880
''Standards for Trill hosts''?

492
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:12,785
That is really incredible
coming from you.

493
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:15,312
l have never seen
any host in my life

494
00:24:15,356 --> 00:24:19,122
who is so far below those
standards as you are, ma'am.

495
00:24:20,428 --> 00:24:24,592
No wonder Curzon Dax tried
to terminate your training.

496
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:41,681
l was finally able to read
the EM flux.

497
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:43,445
There are high plasma
concentrations

498
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:44,884
in a rapidly-expanding mass.

499
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:45,886
How rapidly?

500
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,148
The energy buildup

501
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:49,520
is already straining
the containment chamber.

502
00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:51,582
On top of that, the mass
periodically undergoes

503
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:55,357
phased expansions,
and grows in spurts.

504
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:57,296
lt's a very specific
growth pattern

505
00:24:57,332 --> 00:24:58,890
that the computer recognized.

506
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:00,662
Recognized as what?

507
00:25:00,702 --> 00:25:02,897
The expansion patterns
of a universe.

508
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:03,904
What?

509
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:05,997
A universe?

510
00:25:06,074 --> 00:25:08,941
What we have here, Benjamin,
is a protouniverse

511
00:25:08,977 --> 00:25:11,104
in its earliest stages
of formation.

512
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:12,737
Unfortunately, as it grows

513
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,839
it's displacing
our own universe.

514
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:17,317
Can we get it back
where it came from?

515
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:19,513
This has turned
into an energy mass

516
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:21,681
with properties
that don't conform

517
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:23,122
to our own laws of nature.

518
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:25,022
l have no idea
what might happen

519
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,458
if we tried to move it

520
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:28,587
let alone take it back
into the wormhole.

521
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:32,327
Even if we get it there,
the wormhole's verteron nodes

522
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:34,858
would probably interact
with the energy fluctuations

523
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:38,031
of the protouniverse,
causing a devastating reaction.

524
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:40,266
lt could threaten
this whole system.

525
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:41,570
And if we don't do anything

526
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:44,043
it'll eventually obliterate
this system, and beyond.

527
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,943
Can't we contain it somehow?

528
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,005
Not without destroying it.

529
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,516
Under the circumstances

530
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,849
that sounds like
a pretty good option to me.

531
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:53,945
We can create a force field
that will contain it.

532
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:55,353
lf we can suppress it
long enough

533
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,722
the feedback pressure should
create an implosive wave.

534
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,192
lt would self-destruct.

535
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:01,957
How long before
the next phase of expansion?

536
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,429
About three hours.

537
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:07,298
The collateral shock waves
will probably destroy the lab.

538
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:10,429
Can we get this containment
field ready by then?

539
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,166
Yes, sir.

540
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,640
Have Odo evacuate Section 14.

541
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:16,337
Dismissed.

542
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,487
Ah...

543
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:28,318
Another?

544
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:30,324
Just keep pouring
until l drown.

545
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:31,825
Sounds pretty serious.

546
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:32,826
Serious?

547
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,020
No.

548
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:36,655
l just threw my whole life
out a porthole--

549
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:37,824
nothing serious.

550
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:39,389
There isn't a problem
in the world

551
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:41,834
that can't be fixed
by the right holosuite program.

552
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:45,305
Never trust a Trill, Quark.

553
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,329
Why not?

554
00:26:46,374 --> 00:26:48,808
They're... two-faced.

555
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:49,969
Does that go for all Trills

556
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:51,603
or just for the ones
with the worm?

557
00:26:52,714 --> 00:26:55,512
Any worm named Dax.

558
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,678
Did she break your heart, son?

559
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,778
What?

560
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:01,049
Mine, too.

561
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:02,920
And Bashir is in here
every other day

562
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:04,686
crying into
his synthale over her.

563
00:27:04,726 --> 00:27:05,818
The Promenade is littered
with the bodies...

564
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,005
lt wasn't my heart she broke.

565
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:09,405
lt wasn't my heart she broke.

566
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,407
lt was me.

567
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:12,102
My career, my life...

568
00:27:12,143 --> 00:27:13,303
Wait a minute.

569
00:27:13,344 --> 00:27:15,835
ls this about
all that ''initiate'' stuff?

570
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,509
She told me l wasn't
preparing myself to join.

571
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,677
With the worm?
So, that's her opinion.

572
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:23,346
What's that worth, anyhow?

573
00:27:23,388 --> 00:27:24,616
A bad recommendation

574
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:28,092
from your field docent,
and you can forget it.

575
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:31,061
Listen, son, when l was
a young man, no older than you

576
00:27:31,095 --> 00:27:34,292
l had an apprentice position
with the district sub-nagus.

577
00:27:34,332 --> 00:27:37,130
l licked his boots
like you couldn't believe.

578
00:27:37,168 --> 00:27:39,261
He loved me.
l was his golden boy.

579
00:27:39,304 --> 00:27:40,703
l was on the high road

580
00:27:40,738 --> 00:27:43,206
to the top of the Ferengi
business world

581
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:44,970
and then, it all fell apart.

582
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:47,204
How?

583
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:48,872
Rule of Acquisition 1 12:

584
00:27:48,913 --> 00:27:51,609
''Never have sex
with the boss' sister.''

585
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:55,612
l was fired, broke.

586
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:58,087
lt was quite a setback
to my ambitions.

587
00:27:58,122 --> 00:28:00,647
Well... how did you recover?

588
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:01,659
Never did.

589
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:02,785
Look at me--

590
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:05,421
tending bar out here
in wormhole junction

591
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:08,227
while the big boys
fly by me at warp speed.

592
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:12,396
You only get one shot
at the latinum stairway.

593
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:16,066
lf you miss it, you miss it.

594
00:28:16,107 --> 00:28:18,940
Welcome to the club, son.

595
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,079
Well... thanks.

596
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:25,776
Glad l could help.

597
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:45,101
Computer, confirm
the localized entropy decrease

598
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:46,433
in the energy mass.

599
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:47,768
Confirmed.

600
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:50,171
How much have the readings
decreased in the last hour?

601
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:53,143
Localized entropy readings
have decreased 12 percent

602
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:54,940
during the last 58 minutes.

603
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:56,276
This can't be right.

604
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:58,509
The whole thermodynamic
structure

605
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:00,244
would have to be changing.

606
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:02,149
Activate a quantometer probe.

607
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:05,053
Verify filter calibration.

608
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:07,148
Filter calibration verified.

609
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:11,287
Set energy flux resolution
to .1 microdyne.

610
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:14,662
Begin high-resolution
energy scans.

611
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:18,328
There must be a malfunction
in the sensors.

612
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:20,360
Computer, run
a self-diagnostic

613
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,532
and check
quantometer calibration.

614
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:24,666
Calibration is locked
and normal.

615
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:26,142
Diagnostic underway.

616
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:29,237
Are there any feedback anomalies
in the dynametric array?

617
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,747
Negative.

618
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:32,750
What's the feedback reading?

619
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:34,615
Feedback reading is zero.

620
00:29:34,652 --> 00:29:36,142
Diagnostic complete.

621
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:38,621
Sensors are
functioning normally.

622
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,249
Odo to Sisko.

623
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:44,261
Yes, Odo?

624
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:46,422
Section 14 has been evacuated.

625
00:29:46,464 --> 00:29:47,431
Acknowledged.

626
00:29:47,465 --> 00:29:48,432
Mr. O'Brien?

627
00:29:48,466 --> 00:29:49,933
Just finishing, Commander.

628
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:50,934
Sisko to Dax.

629
00:29:50,968 --> 00:29:53,300
We're preparing to establish
the containment field.

630
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:54,964
l want you out of the lab
during this.

631
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,370
l'm already out, Benjamin

632
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:58,602
but l'm not sure you're going
to want to do this now.

633
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:00,543
Why not?

634
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:03,775
l found indications of life
in the protouniverse.

635
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:13,117
Non-random thermodynamics...

636
00:30:13,157 --> 00:30:15,751
irregular power consumption.

637
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:18,626
The computer's confirmed it.
These are life signs.

638
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:19,857
Now, wait a minute.

639
00:30:19,897 --> 00:30:21,888
Single-cell microbes
are life-forms, too

640
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:24,401
but Dr. Bashir has
a hypospray that'll kill them

641
00:30:24,435 --> 00:30:26,198
to say nothing of the voles.

642
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:27,363
Kira, we could very well

643
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:29,202
be dealing with
intelligent life here.

644
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,571
Well, how is that possible?

645
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:32,803
You told us that this
protouniverse was just formed.

646
00:30:32,844 --> 00:30:33,833
lt's quite possible.

647
00:30:33,878 --> 00:30:35,277
We may have
only experienced hours

648
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:37,144
since this universe
was formed

649
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:38,546
but there's
no way of knowing

650
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,141
how fast time
is moving for them.

651
00:30:40,184 --> 00:30:41,276
Theoretically

652
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,980
billions of years
may have passed.

653
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,487
An entire evolution
of a species

654
00:30:44,522 --> 00:30:46,820
might have taken place
within the last few hours.

655
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:47,984
lt's possible.

656
00:30:48,025 --> 00:30:49,185
O'Brien to Sisko.

657
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:50,558
Go ahead, Chief.

658
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:52,028
Commander,
if we're going to implement

659
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,893
that containment field,
we'd better do it now.

660
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:55,728
ln two minutes,
this thing's going to expand.

661
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:57,199
Get your people
out of there, Chief.

662
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:59,203
We're not going to put up
the containment field.

663
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:00,204
Aye, sir.

664
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:03,105
Commander, this is only
going to delay the inevitable.

665
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:04,540
Take us to Yellow Alert, Major.

666
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:06,475
Move the repair
crews into position.

667
00:31:19,757 --> 00:31:23,454
Warning, hull breach.
Level 22, Section 14.

668
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:24,586
Sisko to O'Brien.

669
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:25,926
Seal off Section 14.

670
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:27,658
Move your repair crews in.

671
00:31:27,698 --> 00:31:28,960
Aye, sir.

672
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,127
How long before
the next expansion?

673
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:32,136
Roughly five hours.

674
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,296
How much will it expand?

675
00:31:33,337 --> 00:31:34,429
About 300 percent.

676
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:36,633
We'll lose a whole section
of the station.

677
00:31:36,674 --> 00:31:38,608
By tomorrow,
the station will be gone.

678
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:40,577
We could beam them into space--

679
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:43,102
give us some more time
to come up with a solution.

680
00:31:43,147 --> 00:31:44,478
We already have a solution

681
00:31:44,515 --> 00:31:45,641
and the longer we wait

682
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:47,514
the harder it's going to be
to implement it.

683
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:49,019
l'm sorry, but it's us or them.

684
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:50,111
We have to destroy it.

685
00:31:50,154 --> 00:31:52,622
You can't just wipe
out a civilization.

686
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:54,557
We'd be committing mass murder.

687
00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:57,026
lt's like stepping on ants, Odo.

688
00:31:57,128 --> 00:31:59,562
l don't step on ants, Major.

689
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:01,724
Just because we
don't understand

690
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:04,826
a life-form, doesn't
mean we can destroy it.

691
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:06,837
Well, do you have a better idea?

692
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:10,937
Does anyone?

693
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:13,967
l'll give you my decision
in an hour.

694
00:32:22,987 --> 00:32:25,785
Personal Log, supplemental.

695
00:32:25,823 --> 00:32:26,949
One hour.

696
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:28,982
One hour to make a decision

697
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,427
that could mean the life
or death of a civilization

698
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:34,488
or the end to our own.

699
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:37,968
My mind keeps going back
to the Borg.

700
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:41,631
How l despised
their indifference

701
00:32:41,672 --> 00:32:44,004
as they tried
to exterminate us.

702
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:47,636
And l have to ask myself,
''Would l be any different

703
00:32:47,678 --> 00:32:51,842
if l destroyed another universe
to preserve my own?''

704
00:32:56,354 --> 00:32:57,981
Hey.

705
00:32:58,022 --> 00:32:59,011
Hi, Dad.

706
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:01,047
What are you doing
back so early?

707
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:02,787
l just wanted to see you.

708
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,598
He told you, didn't he?

709
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:08,758
Told me what?

710
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,165
Chief O'Brien.
Darn it, he promised.

711
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:13,762
lf there's something
you want to tell me

712
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:15,135
l want to hear it.

713
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:23,276
l love her, Dad.

714
00:33:23,314 --> 00:33:24,611
Okay.

715
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:27,345
She's everything l ever
wanted in a woman.

716
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:29,444
l'm sure she's
a wonderful girl.

717
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:31,751
Oh, she's not a girl;
she's a woman.

718
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:34,257
She doesn't like
to be called a ''girl.''

719
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,556
Everyone calls her that,
and she hates it.

720
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:39,188
She wants to be something
better than that.

721
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,197
Than what?

722
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:41,755
Than a dabo girl.

723
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,996
You're in love
with a dabo girl?

724
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:46,229
Wait a minute.

725
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,897
You said Chief O'Brien
told you that...

726
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:49,132
No, l didn't.

727
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:52,404
Who is she,
and how old is she, Jake?

728
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:53,467
Oh, geez...

729
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:54,944
l wanted to tell you

730
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:57,777
but l was sure you
wouldn't understand.

731
00:33:57,815 --> 00:33:59,746
So now, you're hiding
things from me?

732
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:01,141
You mean, you would
have understood?

733
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,614
Of course not.

734
00:34:06,285 --> 00:34:08,810
lt's Mardah, isn't it?

735
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:13,254
The one you've been
tutoring in entomology.

736
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:15,556
l really want you
to meet her, Dad.

737
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,256
l really want to meet her.

738
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:20,094
Can l invite her
to dinner tonight?

739
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:22,101
No.

740
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:24,763
Not tonight.

741
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:26,601
But soon.

742
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,436
Thanks, Dad.

743
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:29,805
You'll love her.

744
00:34:34,914 --> 00:34:37,439
What's so interesting
in there?

745
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:39,110
l can see my future.

746
00:34:39,152 --> 00:34:41,450
l wouldn't trust
a glass of synthale

747
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:43,955
to tell you the future.

748
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,720
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

749
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:49,990
Just use a sharp blade,
so l won't feel it.

750
00:34:50,063 --> 00:34:53,624
You don't know me as well
as you think you do.

751
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,829
l'm sure you looked
at all the training profiles

752
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:59,963
but that doesn't tell you
who Jadzia really was

753
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:01,769
before she was joined.

754
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:06,571
She was the quietest, shyest

755
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:09,581
most withdrawn young woman
you've ever known.

756
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:12,584
Brilliant...
top grades...

757
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:15,917
and not a clue
to what life was about.

758
00:35:15,955 --> 00:35:18,583
She had never lived
outside the program

759
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:19,955
and it didn't matter

760
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:22,586
because she was sailing
through it.

761
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:24,926
Until she met Curzon Dax.

762
00:35:24,964 --> 00:35:29,094
Curzon sized her up
in about 20 seconds

763
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:33,799
and made the next two weeks
the most miserable of her life.

764
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,071
She cried herself
to sleep every night.

765
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,204
She hated him for it.

766
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:42,111
But when the field
training was over

767
00:35:42,148 --> 00:35:44,548
and she learned about
Curzon's recommendation

768
00:35:44,584 --> 00:35:46,677
to terminate her
from the program

769
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,846
she went back a different woman.

770
00:35:48,888 --> 00:35:51,118
She found her voice
and reapplied.

771
00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:55,218
She tore through the program
with a passion, a vengeance.

772
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:56,421
And in the end

773
00:35:56,462 --> 00:35:59,158
the administrators
chose her for joining.

774
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,894
How did you wind up
with the Dax symbiont?

775
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:03,265
When l found out

776
00:36:03,302 --> 00:36:06,897
Curzon was dying,
l requested the Dax symbiont.

777
00:36:06,939 --> 00:36:08,804
And Curzon didn't object?

778
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:09,899
No.

779
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:12,410
And l've never been sure
quite why.

780
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:16,404
Except, as l've come to know
Curzon's dark sense of humor

781
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:20,442
l have a feeling the irony
might have appealed to him.

782
00:36:20,486 --> 00:36:24,388
Jadzia Dax is not Curzon Dax.

783
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:26,584
But l am Dax

784
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:30,585
and l am slowly coming to terms
with what that means to me.

785
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,258
Sometimes it means
gambling or wrestling.

786
00:36:33,299 --> 00:36:35,859
Sometimes it means
waking up an initiate

787
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:39,963
before he slides into the middle
of the pack and gets overlooked.

788
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:43,132
You're giving me another chance?

789
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:46,907
You are the only one who can
give yourself another chance.

790
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:48,971
You can't simply do this anymore

791
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,447
to meet other people's
expectations--

792
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:54,715
not your father's,
not your teachers', not mine.

793
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,221
You need to discover

794
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,281
what Arjin wants out of life,
out of joining.

795
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:00,622
Lieutenant...

796
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,595
we'll try to take it back
through the wormhole.

797
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,062
How soon can you be ready?

798
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,088
l want to be sure
the containment field

799
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:09,431
can block out
any verteron-node radiation

800
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:11,231
as we pass through it.

801
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,294
Uh, about two hours?

802
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:14,101
Better get started.

803
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,604
Wouldn't hurt to have
a level-five pilot along.

804
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:31,947
Chief?

805
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:34,926
The containment field is
in place and holding, sir

806
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,656
but l'd like to run
a practical test

807
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:37,958
on the verteron integrity.

808
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,622
''Like to'' or ''need to''?

809
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:41,633
That thing expands again
in less than an hour.

810
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,532
Well, this is
the strongest force field

811
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:44,934
l know
how to construct, sir.

812
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,871
The test would
at least give us the odds

813
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:48,931
of getting it through
the wormhole intact.

814
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,374
l'm not playing
the odds today.

815
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:51,933
Sisko to <i>Rio Grande.</i>
Your status?

816
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,673
Systems check complete.

817
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:54,907
Auxiliary power to shields.

818
00:37:54,947 --> 00:37:57,177
l'd say we're packed and
ready to go, Benjamin.

819
00:37:57,216 --> 00:37:58,240
Ready transporter.

820
00:37:58,284 --> 00:37:59,979
Locking onto
the containment field.

821
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:01,008
Energize.

822
00:38:03,522 --> 00:38:06,457
Chief, we're getting
a phase variation here.

823
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,084
Stand by.

824
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:11,187
The energy fluctuations are
driving the transporter crazy.

825
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:16,164
We've got it now.

826
00:38:16,202 --> 00:38:18,500
Switching your transporter
to secure mode.

827
00:38:18,537 --> 00:38:20,164
Readings are stable.

828
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:21,503
When you're ready, Dax.

829
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,667
Take us out gently, Arjin.

830
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,734
Firing thrusters.

831
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:34,184
Energy readings from the
containment field are holding.

832
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,279
Take us to 50 kph.

833
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:38,688
Confirmed, 17 seconds
to wormhole.

834
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:40,521
Hold at 50 kph.

835
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,958
Ten seconds to the wormhole.

836
00:38:42,061 --> 00:38:44,427
Reading higher levels
of neutrino activity.

837
00:38:44,463 --> 00:38:46,192
A short cross
to the other side

838
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:47,392
and we're home free.

839
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:48,593
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Ops.

840
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:51,102
Com links will terminate
in five seconds.

841
00:38:52,138 --> 00:38:53,799
See you later.

842
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,103
Acknowledged, <i>Rio Grande.</i>

843
00:38:58,244 --> 00:39:00,974
May the Prophets guide you.

844
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:13,382
Containment-field stability
is down to 85 percent.

845
00:39:13,426 --> 00:39:15,223
Every time we pass through
a verteron node

846
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:17,286
there's resonance leakage
from the energy mass.

847
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,922
ln 20 seconds,
we'll be out of here.

848
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:19,930
We'll never make it.

849
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:22,865
Field stability is down
to 65 percent and falling.

850
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,927
We've got to kill
our forward acceleration now!

851
00:39:25,004 --> 00:39:27,438
All engines stop.

852
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:31,204
38 percent stability,
still falling...

853
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,803
26 percent...

854
00:39:33,846 --> 00:39:37,839
Computer, thrusters on reverse,
two-second burst.

855
00:39:37,883 --> 00:39:39,510
All stop.

856
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,682
lt's stabilizing.

857
00:39:45,725 --> 00:39:48,785
The containment field
is at 27 percent.

858
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:51,729
26 percent and holding.

859
00:39:58,904 --> 00:39:59,871
Now what?

860
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:00,963
Well, we can't stay here.

861
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:04,440
ln 42 minutes,
that energy mass expands.

862
00:40:04,477 --> 00:40:07,207
And once it intersects
with one of those verteron nodes

863
00:40:07,246 --> 00:40:09,441
they'll feel the result
in the Cardassian home world.

864
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:11,074
But the containment field
is so weak now

865
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,982
it will fail as soon as we start
to move again.

866
00:40:13,085 --> 00:40:14,985
Then, l guess we'll just
have to let it fail.

867
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:16,418
Let it fail?

868
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,820
But you said it yourself.

869
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:20,621
lf we pass through even
one of those verteron nodes

870
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:23,958
without the containment field,
the energy mass will explode.

871
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:25,793
Then we'll just have
to avoid them.

872
00:40:25,831 --> 00:40:28,197
You're talking
about precision flying

873
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:29,462
through a wormhole.

874
00:40:29,502 --> 00:40:30,867
lt's never been done.

875
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:32,598
Until now.

876
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,605
Jadzia...

877
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,004
l'm a level-three pilot.

878
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:36,371
You're a level-five.

879
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:39,003
l'll do it if l have to,
but l don't have time to argue.

880
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:42,573
Watch the conn read-outs.

881
00:40:42,615 --> 00:40:46,176
l'll try to keep at least
50 meters away from any node.

882
00:40:46,218 --> 00:40:47,310
Understood.

883
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:49,617
Computer, calibrate
internal scanners

884
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,283
to detect verteron radiation
in the cabin.

885
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,951
Activate sonic indicators.

886
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,757
Verteron levels are
well within safe limits.

887
00:40:56,796 --> 00:40:58,661
We'll start with
one short thruster blast

888
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:00,130
and we'll coast through.

889
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,784
That'll protect the containment
field for a few extra seconds.

890
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:03,781
Thrusters ready.

891
00:41:03,885 --> 00:41:05,546
l'm taking the inertial
dampers off-line.

892
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:07,679
lt'll be a rougher ride

893
00:41:07,722 --> 00:41:10,816
but it'll have
a little more response time.

894
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:12,553
Firing thrusters.

895
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:20,192
Velocity is
at 40 meters per second.

896
00:41:20,234 --> 00:41:23,431
Warning, containment field
at 10 percent.

897
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:25,098
60 seconds to Gamma.

898
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:29,508
Node to starboard,
bearing 037 mark 7.

899
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:32,012
Firing starboard thruster.

900
00:41:37,051 --> 00:41:38,348
Warning.

901
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:40,980
Containment field has collapsed.

902
00:41:43,024 --> 00:41:45,219
No more margin for error.

903
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:47,318
45 seconds to Gamma.

904
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:51,263
Node to port,
bearing 030 mark 51.

905
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:53,324
l've got it.

906
00:41:58,372 --> 00:41:59,839
35 seconds to Gamma.

907
00:41:59,874 --> 00:42:02,104
Verteron levels are still okay.

908
00:42:02,143 --> 00:42:05,203
Jadzia, look at this.

909
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:08,477
We're never going
to get through it.

910
00:42:08,516 --> 00:42:09,881
Reading a passage.

911
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:13,512
Adjust heading to 130 mark 47.

912
00:42:13,554 --> 00:42:15,181
Confirmed.

913
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:18,317
Sensors say it's directly ahead.

914
00:42:19,694 --> 00:42:21,161
l don't see it.

915
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:22,856
Hold your course.

916
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:24,330
l don't see it!

917
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:27,334
l see it!

918
00:42:27,368 --> 00:42:29,928
lt's less than 17 meters across.

919
00:42:30,037 --> 00:42:32,096
The ship is only 14 meters wide.

920
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,608
That gives you over two meters
to work with.

921
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:44,985
Verteron levels are red-lining.

922
00:42:47,021 --> 00:42:49,148
Five seconds to Gamma.

923
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:03,862
This is going to look very good
on your initiate record, Arjin.

924
00:43:03,905 --> 00:43:08,569
Now, let's get this thing
back where it belongs.

925
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:17,712
There's one thing
l want to do before l go

926
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:19,310
and that is to apologize

927
00:43:19,353 --> 00:43:21,913
for the things l said
to you in the lab.

928
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:25,083
That was the first time
you were being honest with me.

929
00:43:25,126 --> 00:43:28,653
Somehow, l always expected that
joining would make any Trill...

930
00:43:28,696 --> 00:43:32,826
complete, serene,
wise beyond her years.

931
00:43:32,867 --> 00:43:35,199
And l'm none
of those things?

932
00:43:35,236 --> 00:43:39,172
What l mean is,
you're nothing like l expected.

933
00:43:39,207 --> 00:43:41,334
l'm nothing like l expected.

934
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:44,208
Life after life--
with each new personality

935
00:43:44,245 --> 00:43:46,406
stampeding around
in your head--

936
00:43:46,447 --> 00:43:48,506
you get desires that scare you

937
00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:51,518
dreams that used to belong
to someone else.

938
00:43:51,552 --> 00:43:53,816
l wouldn't recommend
it for everyone

939
00:43:53,855 --> 00:43:56,688
but, in time, l might
recommend it for you--

940
00:43:56,724 --> 00:43:58,692
when you're ready.

941
00:43:58,726 --> 00:44:00,717
l know what l have to do.

942
00:44:02,897 --> 00:44:04,762
Good luck.

943
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:06,664
Thank you.

944
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,373
l'm not Curzon.
