1
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:06,164
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
supplemental.

2
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:08,860
Chief O'Brien and l are
on board a T'Lani cruiser

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,868
helping the T'Lani
and the Kelleruns

4
00:00:10,902 --> 00:00:13,029
eliminate their stockpiles
of harvesters--

5
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:15,062
deadly biomechanical
gene disrupters

6
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:19,271
used by both sides
in their centuries-long war.

7
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,178
Dr. Nydom,
how's our muon charge?

8
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:24,079
Coming up to full power.

9
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:30,321
Go ahead.

10
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,295
Computer...

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,198
this is harvester test sequence
number 37 5.

12
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:44,098
Muon generator
now at full power.

13
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:45,865
Once more unto the breach.

14
00:00:45,904 --> 00:00:47,201
l hope this works

15
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,707
because, quite frankly,
l'm running out of ideas.

16
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,936
lt took ten years
to perfect the harvesters.

17
00:00:51,977 --> 00:00:54,502
We've only been trying
to eliminate them for a week.

18
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:55,638
ls that all it's been?

19
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,343
lt feels like we've been
working for more than a month.

20
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:00,214
l've never seen
a nano-biogenic weapon

21
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,482
so resistant
to broad-spectrum radiation.

22
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,513
lt's just a matter
of finding the right combination

23
00:01:05,557 --> 00:01:06,717
of muon frequencies.

24
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:08,749
lt should be simple,
but it's not.

25
00:01:08,794 --> 00:01:10,386
Doctor?

26
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:12,761
Start the sequence,
or we will be here for a month.

27
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:14,959
Right, Chief.

28
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:21,496
l'm introducing the harvester
into the genetic bath.

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,872
Beginning muon influx now.

30
00:01:38,156 --> 00:01:42,855
Doctor, please check
for any gene-disrupter phasing.

31
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:50,193
The genetic integrity
of the sample is holding steady.

32
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,295
l'm not reading
any genetic disruption at all.

33
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:54,999
Are you sure?

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,701
Check the sequence again.

35
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:00,807
The results are identical.

36
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:02,404
What?

37
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:06,284
lt worked, didn't it?

38
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:09,754
Would somebody say something?

39
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:14,455
lt worked, all right.

40
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:17,087
The harvesters
have been destroyed.

41
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:21,866
Good news, l take it.

42
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,925
Ambassador Sharat, l am pleased
to inform you

43
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:26,403
that we have found a way
to eliminate the harvesters.

44
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,269
Excellent.

45
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:29,671
Well done.

46
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,768
l knew if our people
stopped killing each other

47
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:34,836
and worked together

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,441
we could put an end
to these horrible weapons.

49
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:39,507
This is a symbol

50
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:42,179
of the new future
we have embarked upon.

51
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,280
Yes, and let's not forget,
we couldn't have done it

52
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:48,588
without the help of our friends
from the Federation.

53
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,494
At first, we questioned
Dr. Nydom's decision

54
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,088
to bring in outside help.

55
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,565
Obviously, it was
the right thing to do.

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,296
We're all very grateful
for your assistance.

57
00:02:58,336 --> 00:02:59,997
lt was our pleasure,
we assure you.

58
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:03,064
But eliminating the harvesters
is only half the task.

59
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:05,133
We must make certain
all scientific data

60
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,440
concerned with them
is wiped out as well.

61
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,673
l've purged every file

62
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:10,738
in the T'Lani
and Kellerun data banks

63
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:12,340
pertaining to the harvesters.

64
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:15,581
lf anyone gets it in their head
to build these things again

65
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,554
they'll have to start
from scratch.

66
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:18,817
Then it's finished.

67
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:19,915
Not quite.

68
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,823
We shouldn't rest

69
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:28,095
until the entire Kellerun
and T'Lani supply of harvesters

70
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,158
has been destroyed.

71
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:32,532
We will begin immediately.

72
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:51,902
Commander, l have Dr. Bashir
for you on subspace.

73
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:53,341
ln here.

74
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:56,107
Commander, we have
some good news to report.

75
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,613
l've already heard.

76
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,910
You have?

77
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:00,576
Yes, l received a message
from both

78
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:02,586
the T'Lani and Kellerun
Ambassadors, informing me

79
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,520
of your success
in neutralizing the harvesters.

80
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:05,647
Congratulations, gentlemen.

81
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,748
Thank you, sir

82
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:10,022
but the Doctor here deserves
the bulk of the credit.

83
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:11,995
Actually, it was a team effort.

84
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,224
The Doctor's just
being modest, sir.

85
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:16,790
He was the one
who came up with muon rays

86
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,301
as a possible solution.

87
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,667
Luckily, it worked.

88
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:21,069
When can we expect you back?

89
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:22,298
Soon, l hope.

90
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,773
The Ambassador said something

91
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:25,742
about a celebration
on T'Lani Prime.

92
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:27,539
Yes, it's set for tonight

93
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:29,443
but the Chief is quite anxious

94
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,345
to return back to the station.

95
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:32,747
lt's been a long week.

96
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,273
Still...

97
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:37,219
l think we can spare you
for another day.

98
00:06:37,254 --> 00:06:40,348
l agree... if that's okay
with you, Chief.

99
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:43,053
l suppose another day
won't kill me.

100
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:44,322
That's the spirit.

101
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,990
Then we'll expect you back
day after tomorrow.

102
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,089
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:49,598
Enjoy yourselves, gentlemen.

104
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,692
You've earned it.

105
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:05,409
The last cylinder.

106
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:09,886
l believe that you should have
the honor, Doctor.

107
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,012
My pleasure.

108
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,386
lt's ironic, isn't it

109
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:15,881
that the war should finally
come to an end up here

110
00:07:15,926 --> 00:07:17,257
above T'Lani lll?

111
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:22,061
A planet whose entire population
was decimated by harvesters.

112
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:26,102
l hope this will be
a lasting peace.

113
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:30,600
What is this?

114
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:33,166
Weapons aren't allowed up here.

115
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:25,495
They're all dead.

116
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:28,396
We will be, too,
if we don't get out of here.

117
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,923
O'Brien to <i>Ganges.</i>

118
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,233
Computer, activate remote
transporter sequence.

119
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:36,600
O'Brien to <i>Ganges!</i>

120
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,198
They must be jamming
communications

121
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:39,266
with the runabout.

122
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:42,473
We sure as hell can't stay here.

123
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:45,038
We'll have to beam down
to the surface.

124
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:47,209
But they'll be able
to follow us.

125
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:49,719
l'm programming the system
to overload

126
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:51,687
30 seconds after we transport.

127
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:53,121
Let's go.

128
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:03,827
l'll have a cup
of Alterian chowder

129
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:05,597
uttaberry crepes...

130
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:07,035
Ah, and a slice of...

131
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:08,468
Kira to Sisko.

132
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,734
Go ahead, Major.

133
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,570
The T'Lani
and Kellerun Ambassadors

134
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:13,338
have just arrived
on the station.

135
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:14,742
They're asking to see you.

136
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:16,712
Are O'Brien
and Dr. Bashir with them?

137
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:18,908
No, Commander,
and the Ambassadors refuse

138
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,382
to speak to anyone but you.

139
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:22,749
Show them to my office.
l'll be right there.

140
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,151
Yes, sir.

141
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,678
l'll have to cancel that order.

142
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,893
Are you saying both
of my officers are dead?

143
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:36,661
Along with some
of our greatest scientists.

144
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,863
We're sorry you had
to share in our misfortune.

145
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:41,531
What happened?

146
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:43,802
lt was...

147
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:46,674
lt was a terrible accident.

148
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,940
lt appears one
of your officers--

149
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,879
a Chief O'Brien, l believe--

150
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:53,679
inadvertently tripped
a security device.

151
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:55,548
A lethal pulse of radiation

152
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,918
flooded the room
killing everyone.

153
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:00,617
Ambassador Sharat
transported off the ship

154
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:03,354
just minutes before
the accident occurred.

155
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,622
This security device?

156
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:06,323
lt was built

157
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:08,194
into the lab's computers
decades ago.

158
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,756
We didn't even know it existed.

159
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,233
lf there were no survivors

160
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:14,260
how do you know that Chief
O'Brien caused the accident?

161
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,034
l was able to return
to the ship

162
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,563
almost immediately
after the accident.

163
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:18,768
The first thing l did

164
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:21,107
was to check
the internal security sensors.

165
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:23,202
They recorded
the entire incident.

166
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,306
We assumed...

167
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:28,409
you'd want to see for yourself.

168
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:33,012
Thank you.

169
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:36,550
Commander, l...

170
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,754
l just want you to know

171
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:40,229
we don't blame Chief O'Brien
for what happened.

172
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,959
On the contrary.

173
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,797
Both he and Dr. Bashir
will always be considered heroes

174
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:46,598
to both the Kellerun
and the T'Lani.

175
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:47,968
Without their help

176
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,405
we never could have
destroyed the harvesters.

177
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,672
Please extend our sympathies
to their families.

178
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:56,111
l'll do that.

179
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,833
Chief. Chief.

180
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:52,995
ln here.

181
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:54,937
Wait!

182
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:56,234
Don't touch anything.

183
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:57,433
But why not?

184
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:59,635
There's food
and medical supplies.

185
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,372
Yeah, they could
be booby-trapped.

186
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:03,710
The Cardassians used
to rig the supplies

187
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:06,045
they left behind
with pressure grenades.

188
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,846
l've seen more than one soldier

189
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:10,080
permanently lose
his appetite that way.

190
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,772
Well, did you find anything?

191
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:13,600
Looks all right.

192
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,800
Good.

193
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:20,141
At least we won't starve.

194
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:23,183
Here.

195
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:24,650
No.

196
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:25,652
Why not, Chief?

197
00:12:25,686 --> 00:12:27,051
l thought you loved
military rations.

198
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,747
Yeah, Federation rations.

199
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,314
l've had enough T'Lani food
this past week

200
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:32,757
to last me a lifetime.

201
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,497
Well, we've got
to keep our strength up.

202
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,195
We're going to have to find
some way

203
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:44,067
of warning the T'Lani
that the Kelleruns

204
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:45,229
have broken the treaty.

205
00:12:45,272 --> 00:12:46,466
l still can't figure it.

206
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:47,939
Why would the Kelleruns wait

207
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,602
till the harvesters
were destroyed

208
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,110
before they made their move?

209
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:53,773
Maybe they didn't hand over

210
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,304
all the harvesters
for destruction.

211
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:56,543
Maybe they're convinced

212
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,381
they can defeat the T'Lani
with conventional weapons.

213
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:00,818
l suppose, but that might mean

214
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:03,015
continuing the war
for another hundred years.

215
00:13:03,056 --> 00:13:05,251
Well, whatever the reason,
we'd better keep moving.

216
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:06,953
Wait! Listen to me, Julian.

217
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,589
The Kelleruns are going to
expect us to be on the move.

218
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:12,656
We start running,
their sensors will pick us up

219
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:13,996
before we've gone a kilometer.

220
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:16,025
lf we stay still,
maybe, just maybe

221
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:18,331
it'll take them longer
to find us.

222
00:13:18,372 --> 00:13:20,169
The way l see it,
we have only one chance

223
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:22,232
to survive this thing

224
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:23,868
and that's to stay alive
long enough

225
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,344
for Commander Sisko to find us.

226
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:27,540
But that won't be
for at least another day.

227
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,175
He still thinks we're
celebrating on T'Lani Prime.

228
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:33,015
l said it was our only chance.

229
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:36,547
l didn't say it was a good one.

230
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:46,493
What have we here?

231
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:51,564
Looks like some
kind of com system.

232
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:54,699
Maybe we can contact
the T'Lani from here.

233
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:57,301
Do you think
you can get it working?

234
00:13:57,344 --> 00:13:59,437
Well, l'll have to open it up--

235
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:02,243
see if there's
a backup power supply.

236
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:10,483
Why don't you take
a seat, Doctor?

237
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:13,288
Well, l thought
maybe l could help.

238
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:15,887
l took the engineering
extension courses

239
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:17,294
at Starfleet Medical.

240
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:18,662
Extension courses?

241
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,929
They were actually
quite informative.

242
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:22,026
Julian?

243
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,195
Hmm?

244
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:24,828
Do you really want to help me?

245
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:25,838
Yes.

246
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:27,601
Then let me do my job.

247
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:30,575
Of course.

248
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,011
l'll, uh, l'll inventory
the supplies, then.

249
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,880
Fine. Why don't you do that?

250
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,717
The last cylinder.

251
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,852
l believe that you should have
the honor, Doctor.

252
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:49,691
My pleasure.

253
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:08,105
The harvesters
have been destroyed.

254
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,547
Congratulations.

255
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,244
Thank you.

256
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:13,184
We must make certain
that all records

257
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,881
of their existence
are wiped out.

258
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:18,379
l've purged every file in the
T'Lani and Kellerun data banks

259
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:19,915
pertaining to the harvesters.

260
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,225
lf anyone gets it in their head
to build these things again

261
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:25,163
they'll have to start
from scratch.

262
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:26,722
Then it's finished.

263
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,498
Hold on.
What's this?

264
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:33,563
Chief?

265
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:35,040
l don't know.

266
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,406
Closing the last file
seems to have activated

267
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:39,036
some kind of security program.

268
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,239
lt looks like it was part

269
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,838
of the original
operating system.

270
00:15:41,882 --> 00:15:42,871
l can't shut it down.

271
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,406
Do you know
anything about this?

272
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:45,611
No.

273
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:48,143
Maybe you should try
cutting the power.

274
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:50,782
lt's not responding.

275
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,657
l've heard of security
weapons like this--

276
00:15:57,697 --> 00:16:00,632
a radiation pulse that
vaporizes any intruder

277
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,862
who doesn't enter
the proper code.

278
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:05,497
l'm surprised the Chief
didn't detect it.

279
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,700
lt must have been buried
very deep in the system.

280
00:16:07,741 --> 00:16:08,901
l'd like to talk

281
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:11,775
to the Chief of Security
for that ship.

282
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:13,643
So would l.

283
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,671
Remember, they lost people, too.

284
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:18,479
But the T'Lani were responsible
for O'Brien and Bashir's safety.

285
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:20,315
They should have known
about that device

286
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:21,411
and deactivated it.

287
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:23,184
That will do, Major.

288
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,956
l'd like for you to contact
Bajoran medical officials.

289
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:28,983
We'll need a doctor

290
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,122
to be temporarily assigned
to the station

291
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:34,463
until Starfleet can send us
a replacement for Dr. Bashir.

292
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:38,562
Dax, inform Starfleet
of the accident.

293
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:41,802
Tell them we'll need
a new Medical Officer

294
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:44,242
and a new Chief of Operations.

295
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:49,206
Would you like me to go
with you to see Mrs. O'Brien?

296
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:53,379
No, l'll take care of it.

297
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,947
Find out how l can contact
Julian's family.

298
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:02,989
Major, inform the crew we'll
be holding a memorial service

299
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,293
tomorrow evening at 1800 hours.

300
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:07,425
Yes, sir.

301
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,958
All right, people

302
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:12,972
l know the next few days
are going to be hard

303
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:15,600
but we all have jobs to do.

304
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,601
Dismissed.

305
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:36,889
So, having any luck?

306
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,626
l wish you'd stop
asking me that.

307
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,826
l'm sorry.

308
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:43,028
lt's just all this
standing around.

309
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:46,037
At least you're doing
something constructive.

310
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:49,667
You just keep your eyes open
for any Kellerun soldiers.

311
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:52,701
Don't worry, l will.

312
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,443
lt's such a mess in here.

313
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:00,180
You'll make it work, Chief.

314
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,415
This is the kind
of challenge you live for.

315
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:04,787
You know, l was looking forward

316
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:06,985
to the celebrations
on T'Lani Prime.

317
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:08,858
l don't know if you've noticed

318
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:11,227
but T'Lani women
are quite attractive.

319
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:13,630
l'm not blind, you know.

320
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:14,793
Of course not.

321
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:16,495
But you are married.

322
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:18,197
Just 'cause you're married

323
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:20,604
doesn't mean you stop
looking at women.

324
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,040
Just as long as you don't
let your wife see you look.

325
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:28,346
For me, tonight's celebrations
would have been an adventure.

326
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:31,908
The most you could have hoped
for was a good meal.

327
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:34,682
Women--
that's all you think about.

328
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:36,484
No, it isn't.

329
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:39,424
Although l do think
about them a lot.

330
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:44,419
Yeah, well, one of these days
you'll fall in love with one.

331
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:46,625
l did once.

332
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,793
Not work out?

333
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:51,861
Not quite.

334
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:53,839
Close.

335
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:56,239
Oh, l don't know.

336
00:18:56,276 --> 00:19:00,235
Somehow, marriage
just doesn't seem fair.

337
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,770
Fair?

338
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:03,373
Fair... to them.

339
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,815
l mean, look at us.

340
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:06,910
Our lives are constantly
in danger.

341
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:08,887
There's enough to worry about

342
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:11,982
without worrying about
the wife and kids at home

343
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:13,286
worrying about us.

344
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:18,792
l'm sorry, Chief.

345
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,799
l just feel that way.

346
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,495
A lot of career officers
feel that way.

347
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:29,098
Well, you career officers
don't know what you're missing.

348
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,540
Really?

349
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:35,145
That may be so.

350
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,877
l just look at you
and Mrs. O'Brien, and l...

351
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:43,180
What about me and Mrs. O'Brien?

352
00:19:43,221 --> 00:19:45,985
Nothing.

353
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:47,821
What?

354
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:49,827
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

355
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,498
lt's no secret that your
assignment to this station

356
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:02,529
hasn't been conducive
to your marriage.

357
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:04,565
Say that again?

358
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:08,705
Why don't we just forget it?

359
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:11,806
That's the first
intelligent thing you've said

360
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,374
since we got here.

361
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:33,634
Are you cold?

362
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:35,036
Yes, aren't you?

363
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:38,199
No. Actually,
it's quite warm in here.

364
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:40,939
You're looking a little pale.

365
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:42,469
l'm fine.

366
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:46,978
Your blood pressure's low
and you're running a fever.

367
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:48,280
You better sit down.

368
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,877
l don't want to sit down.

369
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:51,183
l've got work to do.

370
00:20:51,222 --> 00:20:52,519
Roll up your sleeve.

371
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:53,524
Why?

372
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:54,718
Do it.

373
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,885
Please.

374
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:05,796
You were behind the genetic bath
when it shattered, weren't you?

375
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:08,499
You have something
to tell me, Doctor?

376
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,338
You've been infected
by the harvesters.

377
00:21:33,197 --> 00:21:35,188
Come in.

378
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:39,595
Commander Sisko.

379
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:50,339
Keiko.

380
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:54,007
Something's happened to Miles.

381
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:56,043
There was an accident.

382
00:21:56,087 --> 00:22:00,888
Both your husband and Dr. Bashir
were involved.

383
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:02,552
They're dead.

384
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:05,556
l'm sorry.

385
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:10,465
Tell me what happened.

386
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:14,904
The T'Lani security sensors
recorded the entire incident.

387
00:22:20,912 --> 00:22:23,710
l want to see it.

388
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:25,613
l'll have it sent to you.

389
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:32,017
Miles was a fine officer
and a fine man.

390
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:33,647
l'll miss him.

391
00:22:35,293 --> 00:22:37,022
Thank you, Commander.

392
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:41,121
l would like to be alone now.

393
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:46,330
lf there's anything you need,
just let me know.

394
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:03,450
Chief?

395
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:04,921
lt's my eyes.

396
00:23:04,956 --> 00:23:07,220
They're... getting fuzzy.

397
00:23:07,258 --> 00:23:09,522
You better sit down.
l'll take over from here.

398
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,357
What makes you think
you can fix this?

399
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:13,455
Because you're going
to talk me through it.

400
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:15,261
Now take a seat.

401
00:23:17,835 --> 00:23:19,564
Maybe...

402
00:23:21,906 --> 00:23:24,534
just for a minute...

403
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:29,807
or two.

404
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:33,414
Now, tell me where you left off.

405
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:38,013
You see the dark blue coil
in the upper right-hand corner?

406
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,852
No.

407
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:41,449
lt's there...

408
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:43,016
beside the...

409
00:23:43,094 --> 00:23:45,426
the green cylinder.

410
00:23:45,463 --> 00:23:47,761
Just... just below it.

411
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,358
Yeah, l see it.

412
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:52,494
You have to...

413
00:23:52,537 --> 00:23:57,975
you have to lock
the base of the coil

414
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:02,343
into the tiny receptor...
just below it.

415
00:24:07,218 --> 00:24:09,243
You know, l just remembered

416
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:12,688
l still have Julian's
medical school diaries.

417
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:14,692
He let you read them?

418
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:18,218
He felt they would help me
understand him better.

419
00:24:18,262 --> 00:24:21,925
How? By reading about
all the women he went out with?

420
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:24,093
That's not what they were about.

421
00:24:24,135 --> 00:24:25,625
When he gave them to me

422
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,470
he told me that they were about
his innermost thoughts...

423
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:33,375
his struggle to graduate
top of his class

424
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:37,006
his dream of having a career
in Starfleet

425
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:40,848
his constant fear of failure.

426
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:44,010
Really.

427
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:46,022
And did you?

428
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,648
Understand him better?

429
00:24:50,495 --> 00:24:52,963
l never got around
to reading them.

430
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:58,391
l suppose l should send them
to his parents.

431
00:24:59,604 --> 00:25:01,128
You could keep them.

432
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,498
Really?

433
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,975
l think he'd like that.

434
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:08,102
He cared a great deal about you.

435
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:11,872
l know.

436
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,146
l cared about him, too.

437
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:24,126
These, um... are on the house.

438
00:25:25,196 --> 00:25:26,322
How come?

439
00:25:26,364 --> 00:25:27,991
l thought we'd have a toast

440
00:25:28,032 --> 00:25:30,967
to the memory of Chief
O'Brien and Dr. Bashir.

441
00:25:31,002 --> 00:25:33,562
That's very thoughtful, Quark.

442
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,535
l can be thoughtful.

443
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,110
To our dear, departed comrades.

444
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:49,313
We may have had our differences,
but l'll say this for them--

445
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:52,811
and it's the highest
tribute l can think of--

446
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:54,757
they were good customers.

447
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:59,354
They always paid
their bar bills on time.

448
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:00,523
That's it?

449
00:26:00,565 --> 00:26:02,499
l'm not done yet.

450
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:05,969
At times like this,
l'm reminded of

451
00:26:06,037 --> 00:26:08,938
the 57th Rule of Acquisition:

452
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:12,670
''Good customers are
as rare as latinum.''

453
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:16,807
''Treasure them.''

454
00:26:45,893 --> 00:26:47,258
Mrs. O'Brien...

455
00:26:47,294 --> 00:26:49,592
Major, l need to see
Commander Sisko.

456
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,927
lt's very important.

457
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:52,432
l'll tell him you're here.

458
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:55,367
l just wanted you to know
how sorry l am--

459
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:56,994
how sorry we all are.

460
00:26:57,071 --> 00:26:58,504
Thank you.

461
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:04,336
lf anyone gets it in their head
to build these things again...

462
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:06,471
Watch. lt's coming up
in just a few seconds.

463
00:27:06,514 --> 00:27:08,846
Then it's finished.

464
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:10,851
Computer, freeze image.

465
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:12,944
There.
Do you see it?

466
00:27:13,053 --> 00:27:14,486
l see the Chief drinking coffee.

467
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:15,648
Exactly.

468
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:17,384
Now look at the time index.

469
00:27:17,424 --> 00:27:18,448
1500 hours.

470
00:27:18,492 --> 00:27:19,584
That's right.

471
00:27:19,627 --> 00:27:20,753
Late afternoon.

472
00:27:20,794 --> 00:27:23,888
Miles never drinks coffee
late in the afternoon.

473
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:25,296
lt keeps him up all night.

474
00:27:25,332 --> 00:27:26,822
Maybe he made
an exception this time--

475
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,664
working long hours,
under a lot of stress...

476
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:29,930
l know my husband.

477
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,495
He never drinks coffee
late in the day.

478
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,235
Maybe he isn't drinking coffee.

479
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:35,367
Maybe it's tea.

480
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:36,774
l checked the data clip.

481
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,971
lt contained
a spectroscopic analysis.

482
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:40,981
The liquid in Miles's
cup consists

483
00:27:41,015 --> 00:27:43,210
of vegetable-based
oils and caffeine.

484
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,217
lt's coffee, all right.

485
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:45,218
You're suggesting

486
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:46,913
someone tampered
with this recording?

487
00:27:46,954 --> 00:27:48,979
Yes, l am, and l want
to know the reason why.

488
00:27:49,056 --> 00:27:51,115
Lieutenant, when
were you planning

489
00:27:51,158 --> 00:27:53,649
on bringing the <i>Ganges</i>
back from T'Lani lll?

490
00:27:53,694 --> 00:27:54,718
Tomorrow.

491
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:56,923
l don't see any reason
to wait, do you?

492
00:27:56,964 --> 00:27:58,454
l'll leave right away.

493
00:27:58,499 --> 00:28:00,694
Good.
l'll come with you.

494
00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:06,066
Mrs. O'Brien, if this recording
has been altered,

495
00:28:06,106 --> 00:28:07,733
we'll find out why.

496
00:28:18,986 --> 00:28:20,749
You were right, Chief.

497
00:28:20,788 --> 00:28:23,916
The contacts on the
sub-processor are corroded.

498
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:26,926
Yeah.

499
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:28,690
They need to be cleaned.

500
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:30,959
Oh, um, l think
there are some sterile pads

501
00:28:31,031 --> 00:28:33,158
in the med kit.

502
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:39,634
Here we go.

503
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:46,910
Don't leave me, Chief.

504
00:28:46,947 --> 00:28:48,005
l still need you.

505
00:28:50,217 --> 00:28:51,684
Don't worry.

506
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,380
l'm not going anywhere.

507
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:00,016
So, who was she?

508
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:02,618
Who?

509
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:05,257
''Not quite. Close.''

510
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:08,692
Palis. Palis Delon.

511
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,170
She was a dancer-- a ballerina.

512
00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:13,799
She had the most exquisite feet.

513
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:16,239
l'm serious.

514
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:20,212
lt's very important for a dancer
to have good arches.

515
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:22,647
She was gorgeous

516
00:29:22,683 --> 00:29:24,344
not to mention brilliant.

517
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:26,319
l used to watch her onstage.

518
00:29:26,353 --> 00:29:29,789
l couldn't believe how anyone
could be so graceful.

519
00:29:29,823 --> 00:29:32,849
And she was crazy
about you, huh?

520
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:36,590
We were crazy about each other.

521
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,157
l used to think,
''Julian, you lucky devil.

522
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,930
You found the perfect woman.''

523
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,905
We used to finish
each other's thoughts.

524
00:29:45,939 --> 00:29:47,907
There.

525
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:53,679
What do you think?

526
00:29:53,714 --> 00:29:56,683
Good... good.

527
00:29:56,717 --> 00:29:59,117
Put it back in the com panel.

528
00:30:14,668 --> 00:30:17,330
Looks like we have some power,
anyway.

529
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:29,309
Still no response
from the transmitter, though.

530
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:32,648
Try re-tuning
the R-F oscillators.

531
00:30:35,756 --> 00:30:39,453
So what happened
with you and Palis?

532
00:30:39,493 --> 00:30:41,757
What happened is l graduated.

533
00:30:41,795 --> 00:30:44,525
Her father was
the top administrator

534
00:30:44,565 --> 00:30:46,931
at a medical complex in Paris.

535
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:48,525
He offered me a job.

536
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:52,528
Promised l'd be Chief of Surgery
within five years.

537
00:30:52,573 --> 00:30:56,475
But you would have to give up
your Starfleet career.

538
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,002
l can't tell you
how close l came.

539
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:03,380
But... here l am.

540
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:06,147
You made your choice.

541
00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:07,414
Yeah.

542
00:31:07,454 --> 00:31:10,651
Sometimes, l wake up
in the middle of the night

543
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:12,420
and l think to myself...

544
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:16,486
will l ever find anyone
that wonderful again?

545
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,725
The oscillator's working

546
00:31:18,766 --> 00:31:21,030
but the frequency's
still fluctuating.

547
00:31:23,837 --> 00:31:25,327
Let me take a look.

548
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,364
Oh!

549
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:33,671
What is it?

550
00:31:33,714 --> 00:31:37,013
lt's... my legs.

551
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,314
l can't feel them.

552
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:48,183
We're approaching T'Lani lll.

553
00:31:48,228 --> 00:31:50,753
Establishing a synchronous orbit
alongside the <i>Ganges.</i>

554
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:53,426
Open a channel
to the T'Lani cruiser.

555
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:56,903
Commander Sisko,
what a pleasant surprise.

556
00:31:56,937 --> 00:31:58,802
l take it you're here
for your runabout?

557
00:31:58,839 --> 00:31:59,965
That's correct.

558
00:32:00,007 --> 00:32:01,133
We were about to leave

559
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:03,541
for the memorial service
on T'Lani Prime.

560
00:32:03,577 --> 00:32:05,408
You're welcome to accompany us.

561
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:06,810
Perhaps we will, but first

562
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:09,907
l'd like to see for myself
where the accident took place.

563
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,817
Of course.

564
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:14,480
While you're on the cruiser

565
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:16,250
l think l'll beam
over to the <i>Ganges</i>

566
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,655
and take a look around.

567
00:32:17,691 --> 00:32:18,885
Good idea.

568
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:27,295
Chief.

569
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:29,393
Chief, it's working.

570
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:31,301
Signal's very faint.

571
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:35,604
You'll have to switch to
a higher-carrier frequency.

572
00:32:35,642 --> 00:32:38,975
Reset the actuators
on the chambers coil.

573
00:32:39,012 --> 00:32:41,003
That's better.
lt's still pretty weak, though.

574
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:42,446
l'm sending a distress signal.

575
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,109
lt's set to repeat
every two minutes.

576
00:32:44,151 --> 00:32:46,619
Let's hope the T'Lani find us
before the Kelleruns do.

577
00:32:46,653 --> 00:32:49,554
They better get here soon.

578
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:52,655
Don't worry, Chief.

579
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:54,593
l'm going to get you home.

580
00:32:56,663 --> 00:32:57,789
ln a box, maybe.

581
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:58,798
Nonsense.

582
00:32:58,832 --> 00:33:01,858
Don't go giving up on me now.

583
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:03,767
l'm not giving up.

584
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:04,949
l'm dying.

585
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,318
Listen to me...
listen to me, Julian.

586
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,886
You must tell Keiko and Molly...

587
00:33:13,924 --> 00:33:16,188
You tell them yourself.

588
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:22,224
You were wrong, you know...

589
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,858
about marriage.

590
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,892
Whatever you say, Chief.

591
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:28,029
Listen to me, Julian!

592
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,471
You're the one

593
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,136
who's always talking
about adventure.

594
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,769
Ha... adventure.

595
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:39,511
Marriage is the greatest
adventure of them all.

596
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:43,486
lt's filled with
pitfalls and setbacks

597
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,512
and mistakes and...

598
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:48,719
but it's a journey
worth taking...

599
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,694
because you take it together.

600
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:57,634
l know Keiko's been unhappy
about us coming to the station.

601
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,102
We still argue about it.

602
00:34:00,137 --> 00:34:02,105
But that's all right

603
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:04,767
because at the end of the day

604
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,744
we both know
we love each other.

605
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:09,268
Chief...

606
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:10,871
And that's all that matters.

607
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:11,882
Chief...

608
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:12,883
Huh?

609
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,475
You better get some rest.

610
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,529
The T'Lani will be here soon.

611
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,466
l see there's still
some residual traces

612
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,064
of the radiation pulse.

613
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,271
Well, that's to be expected
given the pulse's intensity

614
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,778
but it poses no danger.

615
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:42,938
Tell me, Ambassador

616
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,947
have you been able
to learn anything else

617
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,213
about the fail-safe device
that caused the accident?

618
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,482
Not yet, Commander,
but we're working on it.

619
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,955
lt was Ambassador Sharat that
brought you the data clip?

620
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:54,320
That's right.

621
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:55,825
And l suppose
he showed it to you

622
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,918
as soon as you arrived?

623
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,293
Of course.

624
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,527
Could the clip have been
altered before you saw it?

625
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:09,202
Why would Ambassador Sharat
alter the data clip?

626
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,764
l have no idea.

627
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,469
Dax to Sisko.

628
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,841
Sisko.

629
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,470
Commander,
when you're through there

630
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,912
could you join me on the <i>Ganges?</i>

631
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,473
Yes, l'll be here
a few more minutes.

632
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,645
Commander, the T'Lani
and the Kellerun

633
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:24,051
have finally made peace.

634
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,521
That peace cannot survive

635
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,581
unless both sides
trust each other.

636
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:38,932
What have you got, Dax?

637
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,800
lt looks like someone
erased five seconds

638
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,203
from the <i>Ganges'</i> computer log.

639
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,934
Show me.

640
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,499
At first, l thought it was just
some kind of power fluctuation.

641
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,171
but when l checked
the log's memory core

642
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,180
it showed traces
of a remote transport command.

643
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,511
Did you find any indication

644
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,244
of transport activity
at that time?

645
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,376
No.

646
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,680
And you're saying

647
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,947
somebody erased it later on?

648
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,545
Look at the time index when
the call for transport came in.

649
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,558
1534-- that's
a full three minutes

650
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:04,026
after the accident
on the T'Lani cruiser.

651
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,757
Which means if either
Chief O'Brien or Julian

652
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,025
made that request...

653
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,623
They would have been alive

654
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,828
after the fail-safe device
went off.

655
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,268
Good work, Lieutenant.

656
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,402
Chief...

657
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,431
Chief!

658
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:21,341
Don't leave me now.

659
00:36:21,378 --> 00:36:22,538
Breathe.

660
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,911
That's better.

661
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,972
Now you're doing it.

662
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:35,753
Tell me, Julian...

663
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:39,752
ever talk to that
ballerina of yours?

664
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:43,096
Not since l left Earth.

665
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:45,727
Well, maybe...
maybe you should.

666
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:47,638
Well, maybe one day l will.

667
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,127
Well, maybe one day l will.

668
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:07,884
Ambassador E'Tyshra.

669
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:09,186
Am l glad to see you.

670
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,091
Chief O'Brien was infected
by the harvesters

671
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,720
when the Kelleruns
attacked your ship.

672
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,230
They killed
all of the scientists.

673
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,256
Not all of them.

674
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,892
You're too late, Sharat.

675
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:19,868
No, Doctor, he's right on time.

676
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:22,838
But why kill
Nydom and the others?

677
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,170
To ensure
that the peace agreement

678
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,470
between our two races will last.

679
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,374
But we'd already destroyed
the harvesters.

680
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,175
There was no reason
for more killings, unless...

681
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,910
lt's not enough to simply
destroy the harvesters.

682
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,646
We have to be sure
no one can ever recreate them.

683
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,587
The only way to do that
was to eliminate everyone

684
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:41,887
who possessed such knowledge,
including the two of you.

685
00:37:41,925 --> 00:37:45,452
But we have no use
for such horrible weapons.

686
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:48,932
As long as the knowledge exists,
there's a danger it may be used.

687
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,160
That's a risk
we refuse to live with.

688
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:52,668
l truly am sorry, Doctor

689
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,035
but at least you
have the consolation

690
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,439
of knowing that your deaths
will be for a noble cause.

691
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,665
Wait.

692
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,463
Let him speak.

693
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:26,833
Help me...
help me up.

694
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,008
l want to die on my feet.

695
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:42,008
l'm sorry l didn't
get us home, Chief.

696
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,644
You did your best.

697
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:48,655
lt's been an honor...
serving with you.

698
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,684
Thank you, Chief.

699
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,626
That means a lot.

700
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:06,969
Commander, am l glad to see you!

701
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,673
Chief O'Brien is going
to be dead within the hour

702
00:39:10,714 --> 00:39:12,511
if we don't get him back
to the station.

703
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:13,777
What happened?

704
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:15,614
He was exposed
to the harvesters.

705
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:17,405
That should stabilize him
for now.

706
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,506
They told us
you were both dead, Julian.

707
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,768
We would have been

708
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:22,799
if the T'Lani and Kelleruns
had had their way.

709
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:24,311
They're killing
everyone involved

710
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:25,369
with the harvesters project.

711
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:26,846
The T'Lani cruiser's
coming this way.

712
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:27,846
They're hailing us.

713
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:29,007
lgnore them.

714
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,177
Send a general distress signal

715
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:33,847
on all Federation
subspace frequencies.

716
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,719
They're blocking
all subspace communication

717
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:38,554
with a broadband inversion.

718
00:39:38,593 --> 00:39:40,584
They're hailing us again.

719
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:44,587
ls the inversion field
affecting sensors, as well?

720
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,260
All short-range
sensors are useless.

721
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,030
Which means...

722
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,731
theirs are useless, too.

723
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:05,348
Ambassador, Commander Sisko
is attempting to escape.

724
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:06,375
We are in pursuit.

725
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,887
Can we overtake them?

726
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:10,446
Their runabout
is no match for this ship.

727
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,788
Fire a warning shot.

728
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:15,028
Confirmed.

729
00:40:15,062 --> 00:40:17,758
Commander Sisko is hailing us.

730
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:18,890
l thought he would.

731
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,992
By firing on this vessel

732
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:24,334
you've committed an act of war
against the Federation.

733
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:26,738
Commander, we have no quarrel
with the Federation or with you.

734
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:30,471
But we must insist you turn over
Dr. Bashir and Chief O'Brien.

735
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,172
Why?
So you can murder them?

736
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:34,113
Unfortunately, Commander,
your officers

737
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:36,673
are the only two people left
who have seen the data

738
00:40:36,717 --> 00:40:38,912
concerning the development
of the harvesters.

739
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,284
They have no intention
of using that information.

740
00:40:41,322 --> 00:40:42,584
You have my word.

741
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:44,750
Their intentions are irrelevant.

742
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:48,159
The fact is, the threat remains
as long as the knowledge exists.

743
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,822
Commander, l know this
is painful for you.

744
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,331
lt wasn't easy for us

745
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,663
to order the deaths
of our own people

746
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,134
but it is necessary.

747
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:57,069
And if l refuse
to turn them over?

748
00:40:57,104 --> 00:40:59,766
You can't outrun us,
and you can't fight us.

749
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:02,401
We can destroy your runabout
at any time.

750
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:04,968
Lieutenant Dax and l have
no knowledge of the harvesters.

751
00:41:05,012 --> 00:41:06,445
Are you willing to kill us, too?

752
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,540
We'll do whatever we have to do
to ensure our safety.

753
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,279
Commander,
you are running out of options.

754
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:12,547
You have one minute

755
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:14,885
to turn over Dr. Bashir
and Chief O'Brien.

756
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:16,286
You want them?

757
00:41:16,324 --> 00:41:19,691
You're going to have
to take us all.

758
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,524
He leaves us no choice.

759
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,893
The runabout is turning.

760
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:25,090
lt's heading back
in our direction.

761
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:26,690
Full stop.

762
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,097
He's preparing to fire.

763
00:41:30,137 --> 00:41:31,229
Employ shields.

764
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:33,263
Shields employed.

765
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:35,400
Put the runabout on screen.

766
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:39,604
He must know his phasers
can't hurt us.

767
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:44,844
He's aiming his vessel
straight for us.

768
00:41:44,885 --> 00:41:46,853
The man must be crazy.

769
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:48,980
Fire phasers.

770
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:58,090
lt's over.

771
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:03,496
Head back to T'Lani lll.

772
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:06,199
Prepare to take
the other runabout in tow.

773
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:09,804
Ambassador...

774
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:12,677
sensors indicate
the other runabout

775
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:15,113
is no longer in orbit.

776
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:16,810
Well, then, where is it?

777
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:18,011
l don't know.

778
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:19,280
lt's gone.

779
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,379
lt can't just have disappeared.

780
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:23,890
l'm picking up a warp signature.

781
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,983
Sisko.

782
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:30,626
Maybe he and the others weren't
on that runabout we destroyed.

783
00:42:30,665 --> 00:42:32,895
They could have transported
to the other runabout

784
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,365
while our sensors were down.

785
00:42:34,402 --> 00:42:37,803
And then piloted the first ship
by remote navigation.

786
00:42:39,173 --> 00:42:41,038
But we saw them die.

787
00:42:42,843 --> 00:42:44,071
Did we?

788
00:42:50,284 --> 00:42:51,376
What's this?

789
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:52,909
Something Molly made for you.

790
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:55,114
She painted it herself.

791
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,714
Oh, it's lovely.

792
00:42:56,757 --> 00:42:58,748
She has real talent.

793
00:42:58,793 --> 00:42:59,885
How's my patient?

794
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:01,792
Better.
Can l go home now?

795
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,127
You should be out of here
by tomorrow.

796
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,860
l just wanted to let you know

797
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,768
how much l appreciated what
you said back on T'Lani lll.

798
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:11,635
What did l say?

799
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,106
That it was an honor
serving with me.

800
00:43:15,376 --> 00:43:16,570
Oh... right.

801
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:19,670
And l'd like to return
the compliment, if l may.

802
00:43:19,714 --> 00:43:22,774
lt's been an honor
serving with you, too, Chief.

803
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:25,875
You know, Mrs. O'Brien, they say

804
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:28,888
that when two people face death
together, it creates a bond

805
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:30,218
that cannot be broken.

806
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:32,054
l never believed that
until l went...

807
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:33,117
Julian...

808
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,525
Hmm?

809
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,195
Oh.

810
00:43:38,232 --> 00:43:40,700
Um, of course
you'd like to be alone.

811
00:43:40,735 --> 00:43:41,929
l understand.

812
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,605
Miles, he saved
your life, you know.

813
00:43:51,645 --> 00:43:54,205
Mmm. He's never going
to let me forget it.

814
00:43:54,248 --> 00:43:55,442
So, what was it like

815
00:43:55,483 --> 00:43:57,815
spending all that time
alone with him?

816
00:43:57,852 --> 00:43:58,876
lt was hell.

817
00:43:58,919 --> 00:44:00,614
You can see for yourself.

818
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:02,645
The man never stops talking.

819
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:07,760
You know, l wouldn't mind
a cup of coffee right now.

820
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:10,992
Miles, you never drink coffee
in the afternoon.

821
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:12,225
Well, sure l do.

822
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:14,412
You do?
