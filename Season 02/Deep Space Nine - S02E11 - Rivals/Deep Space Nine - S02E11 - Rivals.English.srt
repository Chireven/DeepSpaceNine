1
00:00:10,202 --> 00:00:13,694
When my husband was alive,
we ran the business together

2
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:15,502
and l managed to put away

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,532
a bit of latinum
every year just for myself.

4
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:21,171
Now he's gone, well...

5
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:24,546
l've got quite a little sum.

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,278
That's important.

7
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,548
Well, to be honest,
it's not enough--

8
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:30,020
not for the future--

9
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:33,616
not for the way l want
to live out my retirement.

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,389
So, l've decided
to invest it all in...

11
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:39,295
l can't believe
l'm telling you this.

12
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,697
l just met you.

13
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,361
But l feel like
l can really trust you.

14
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:46,667
lt's like l've
known you forever.

15
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:51,074
When hearts are in sympathy,
time collapses.

16
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:52,940
l'm taking everything l saved

17
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:55,503
and l'm purchasing
the mining concession

18
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:58,675
on the entire
Vlugtan asteroid belt.

19
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:02,209
How ambitious, and such
an adventurous undertaking

20
00:01:02,254 --> 00:01:04,882
for a woman
of your delicate sensibilities.

21
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:06,356
But are you sure that's wise?

22
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,619
Prospecting can be risky.

23
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:09,149
Not this time.

24
00:01:09,227 --> 00:01:11,855
My father was
a stellar cartographer.

25
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:14,889
30 years ago, he conducted
a full spectrum

26
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,128
mineral analysis
of those asteroids

27
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:20,798
but he never had the means
to follow up on what he found.

28
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:24,468
And now you plan to carry
out your father's dream.

29
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,171
When his survey results
become public

30
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:30,840
l'll get seven times
my investment back-- overnight.

31
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:35,649
l still can't believe
l'm telling you this.

32
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:37,951
My secret plan.

33
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:40,549
l've been thinking
about it for years.

34
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:42,560
l never even told my husband.

35
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:44,824
lt must be
all this Gamzian wine.

36
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:48,189
How brave you are

37
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,997
to do all of this on your own.

38
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:53,698
lt hasn't been easy.

39
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:58,540
There's so much to keep
track of, so much to do.

40
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,171
Maybe l could help.

41
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:08,717
Would you consider some
kind of partnership?

42
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,483
Let's go.

43
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:12,547
Exactly where are we going?

44
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,990
To Security.

45
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:15,890
But l've done nothing wrong.

46
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,758
lt's true.
We were just talking.

47
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:19,593
You were talking, Madam.

48
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:21,121
He was listening.

49
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,967
Security Chief Odo, isn't it?

50
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:28,973
l've been watching you
ever since you arrived.

51
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:30,565
Should l be flattered?

52
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,806
Martus Mazur, a refugee
from the El-Aurian system.

53
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:36,871
Well, everyone has to be
from somewhere.

54
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:38,746
Where are you from, Odo?

55
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,979
Don't pull that routine on me.

56
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:42,316
What routine?

57
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:44,515
l know all about you El-Aurians.

58
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:47,354
You're listeners.
People like to talk to you.

59
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:50,190
Everyone has to have
someone to confide in--

60
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:52,355
someone to hear their stories.

61
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:54,092
l offer a sympathetic ear

62
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,498
and if they request my help,
l give it to them.

63
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:58,127
That couple
from Pythro V told me

64
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,331
you asked for their
financial access codes.

65
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,397
Some might call helping
an elderly couple

66
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:04,500
invest their savings
a compassionate act.

67
00:03:04,543 --> 00:03:07,512
Not when you invest it
in your own business--

68
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:09,514
a business that promptly folds.

69
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:11,846
l had a run of bad luck.

70
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:14,044
No one regrets it
more than l do.

71
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:15,780
You're a con man.

72
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,584
And they've signed a complaint.

73
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,789
This isn't necessary.

74
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,351
lt really isn't necessary.

75
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:25,693
l'm not going anywhere.

76
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,391
Let's have a drink.

77
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:29,366
Talk a bit?

78
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,359
Chief.

79
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:48,065
Hello, Doctor.

80
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:49,130
Great job.

81
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,369
You built it yourself,
didn't you?

82
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,070
Yeah, just finished.

83
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,578
l missed playing

84
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:57,548
and l figured
there would be at least

85
00:05:57,582 --> 00:06:00,050
a couple of other players
on board.

86
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:02,383
Didn't think
you'd be one of them.

87
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,082
Captain of the team
at Starfleet Medical Academy.

88
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:07,114
We took the Sector Championships
in my final year.

89
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:09,353
Against other medical students?

90
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:10,691
Against everybody.

91
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,629
Played a Vulcan in the finals.

92
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,131
Talk about stamina.

93
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,224
Didn't think he ever actually
broke a sweat.

94
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,700
And you won?

95
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:19,727
Took him
on a back wall riser shot.

96
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:23,101
Oh, well, l can't say

97
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:27,134
l've had much in the way
of formal training myself

98
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:31,046
but it's been a serious pastime
for a lot of years.

99
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:33,448
Oh, some of the toughest players
l've come up against

100
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:35,248
didn't really know
what they were doing.

101
00:06:35,286 --> 00:06:36,344
Really?

102
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:38,720
Ah... formally, l mean.

103
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:41,824
Hey, whatever works, works.

104
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,259
This exercise, for example

105
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:45,819
l picked up at a tournament
from a top player.

106
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,889
lt's a 5,000-year-old
battle warm-up.

107
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:50,826
According to the legend

108
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,927
it makes the heart
a friend to the hand.

109
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:00,626
Medically, l don't really know
what that means

110
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:02,533
but, uh, it seems to give me
a lot of energy.

111
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,731
Fancy a game?

112
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:06,262
Serve.

113
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:09,299
l guess by the lines,
you prefer the old-style rules?

114
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,770
l can play any style you like.

115
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,510
Traditional it is, then.

116
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,177
Always been
my personal favorite.

117
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:19,880
Serve.

118
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:30,395
One.

119
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:44,039
Pardon me, friend.

120
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:51,016
Pardon me.

121
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:30,453
Friend...

122
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:33,187
friend, are you all right?

123
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:37,623
l thought you died.

124
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:40,463
lf only l could be
so fortunate.

125
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:42,628
You were snoring.

126
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,900
Please accept my apologies.

127
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:47,305
l didn't mean to disturb you.

128
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:52,108
But, as you can see,
my health is not so good.

129
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:55,580
Yes. Well, l'm sorry
l had to wake you.

130
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:58,346
l wasn't always like this.

131
00:08:58,385 --> 00:08:59,750
Of course not.

132
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:03,917
l had youth, vigor, fame...

133
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,758
wealth beyond measure.

134
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:10,593
All gone.

135
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:14,465
l'm not listening.

136
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:19,368
All because of this.

137
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,112
A gambling device?

138
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:34,950
Did you win?

139
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:37,219
Of course not.

140
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:40,750
You gambled away
everything you had?

141
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:42,819
ln a manner of speaking.

142
00:09:42,863 --> 00:09:47,266
Every trade deal l struck
was a disaster.

143
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:49,326
Every alliance l formed
fell apart.

144
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,103
Every endeavor backed,
a failure.

145
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,643
Well, what does this
have to do with a toy?

146
00:09:56,677 --> 00:09:59,441
Sounds like you just had
a lot of rotten luck.

147
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,447
Yes...

148
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,540
rotten luck.

149
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:09,318
ln the end,
it all comes down to luck.

150
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:17,227
l won!

151
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:18,322
That's nice.

152
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:19,957
What did you win?

153
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:46,960
Officer...

154
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,861
you've got
a dead prisoner in here.

155
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:52,388
Officer!

156
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,565
How'd it go?

157
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:12,415
Good workout?

158
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:13,886
Medical school...

159
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:16,082
Captain of the team
at medical school.

160
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:18,318
Who are you talking about?

161
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:20,020
Bashir.

162
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,425
You had a game?

163
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:22,929
No, he had a game.

164
00:11:22,963 --> 00:11:25,363
l just kind of stumbled around
the court for 90 minutes

165
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,889
and made
a complete ass of myself.

166
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:29,129
l'm sure
he didn't see it that way.

167
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:31,137
The hell he didn't--

168
00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:33,833
that smug look on his face.

169
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:36,934
''l guess you prefer
old-style rules.''

170
00:11:36,977 --> 00:11:39,138
Like l was some kind of fossil.

171
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:42,477
ln my day, l could have wiped
the court with him.

172
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:44,677
That's a point.
You're not a kid anymore.

173
00:11:44,718 --> 00:11:47,687
lt's nothing to be ashamed of.

174
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:49,689
People just naturally slow down.

175
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:52,157
Oh, like molasses in winter,
huh?

176
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:53,523
Thanks.

177
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,358
Miles, you're taking this
way too seriously.

178
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:58,957
l'm out of shape, that's all.

179
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,365
l just need to get me wind back.

180
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:03,393
Sector champion, my eye.

181
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:06,804
He's vulnerable
to every one of my best shots.

182
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:13,272
l just...
l just couldn't get them there.

183
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:15,179
This time.

184
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:22,880
l thought he was going
to have a heart attack.

185
00:12:22,923 --> 00:12:25,084
Come on, Julian,
it couldn't have been that bad.

186
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,649
No, really,
his face was flushed.

187
00:12:26,694 --> 00:12:27,991
l could have taken his pulse

188
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:29,996
just watching
the side of his neck.

189
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,292
Then why didn't you stop it?

190
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:32,765
Well, don't think
l didn't try.

191
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,427
After the first game,
l told him l had

192
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:35,901
an appointment--
he ignored me.

193
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:38,097
After the second game,
l told him l was getting tired.

194
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:39,435
He didn't believe me.

195
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:42,806
And then his racket broke,
and l thought, ''Finally...''

196
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:44,276
But no, he made me stay there

197
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,677
while he went away
and replicated another one.

198
00:12:46,714 --> 00:12:48,147
So, what finally happened?

199
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:51,614
While he was gone

200
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:53,620
l called my assistant
and told her...

201
00:12:53,654 --> 00:12:55,246
May l?

202
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:57,257
...told her to call me back
after five minutes

203
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,589
and say there was an emergency
at the lnfirmary.

204
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:00,593
Oh, that's terrible.

205
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:01,958
There was no other way out.

206
00:13:01,995 --> 00:13:04,259
Otherwise, there would have been
an emergency--

207
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:05,560
Chief O'Brien's coronary.

208
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:07,863
Well, at least it's all over.

209
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:08,993
That's just it.

210
00:13:09,036 --> 00:13:11,004
This is just the beginning.

211
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:12,869
The Chief wants a rematch

212
00:13:12,906 --> 00:13:15,704
and l'm telling you,
it's going to kill him.

213
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:17,540
Honestly, Julian,
you're exaggerating.

214
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:19,569
O'Brien can't be a day over 38.

215
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:21,979
That's too young to die.

216
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:27,779
l guess l'm overstating
the health risk.

217
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:30,119
That's not the point.

218
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,953
The Chief has a lot of pride

219
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:32,959
and for good reason.

220
00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:34,893
l really respect him--
the things he does

221
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:36,327
the kind of man he is.

222
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:41,661
l just... l just don't
want to humiliate him.

223
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,249
Another winner.

224
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,758
What luck.

225
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:57,091
The Pythron couple
has refused to press charges.

226
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:58,662
You can go.

227
00:13:58,697 --> 00:13:59,664
Of course.

228
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:01,996
Didn't l tell you?

229
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:04,559
They're my friends.

230
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,467
All right.

231
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:10,338
Double or nothing.

232
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,502
House always takes blue.

233
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:14,478
Sorry, the drink's on you.

234
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:15,980
Can l help you?

235
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,504
Prosecco.

236
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,644
And how do you plan
on paying for this?

237
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:23,154
With charm, perhaps?

238
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:24,655
Double or nothing.

239
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,885
Double nothing is still nothing.

240
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:29,018
lf l lose, l'll give you this.

241
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:31,791
House always takes blue.

242
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,291
Lucky.

243
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,667
My luck's running good today.

244
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:40,262
So l've heard.

245
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:42,330
Decided not to testify,
did they?

246
00:14:42,374 --> 00:14:44,069
l don't know what you mean.

247
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:45,473
No?

248
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,569
The 47th Rule
of Acquisition says

249
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:50,581
''Don't trust a man wearing
a better suit than your own.''

250
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:52,583
Either you're a con artist

251
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:54,881
or you're covering up
an empty coin purse.

252
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,081
l happen to know it's both.

253
00:14:57,155 --> 00:15:00,022
Well, we can't be all
as successful as you are.

254
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,124
Too true.

255
00:15:12,237 --> 00:15:13,534
Some kind of game?

256
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:15,039
l've never seen that one before.

257
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:16,039
How do you play?

258
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:18,167
Just press the key.

259
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,253
Too bad.

260
00:15:37,662 --> 00:15:40,961
As l told you,
my luck's running good today.

261
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:42,796
Am l supposed to be impressed?

262
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:44,461
A little tinkering

263
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:46,767
some replication
and expansion...

264
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:49,968
lt might make
a nice addition to your casino.

265
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:51,566
And who would play this?

266
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,602
lt's just a child's toy.

267
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:57,615
My nephew, um...

268
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:01,176
it might keep him out of my ears
for a couple of days.

269
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:02,413
l'll take it.

270
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:05,423
That's a tidy sum.

271
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:08,426
l'm feeling benevolent today.

272
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,893
Have another.

273
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:19,127
l might have accepted,
but the offer of the drink--

274
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:22,197
that tells me
you're very interested.

275
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,038
Nonsense.
You read too much into nothing.

276
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:27,636
My benevolence
is known far and wide.

277
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,171
Oh, it's legendary, l'm sure.

278
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:36,051
l'll take 100 times
what you've got here.

279
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,022
Not in this space-time
continuum, you won't.

280
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:43,357
Go try to peddle this little
triviality down on Bajor.

281
00:16:43,395 --> 00:16:45,955
You might be able
to trade it for a meal

282
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:48,056
but it won't be a hot one.

283
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:52,263
You'll be in profit
by the end of the week.

284
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:58,500
Final offer.

285
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,875
Take it before
my generosity fades.

286
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:13,419
Perhaps l'll hold onto it
a bit longer.

287
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,426
Suit yourself.

288
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,428
But be under no illusion--

289
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:21,125
if l was serious about
acquiring this, it would be mine

290
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,828
and for substantially less
than what you had hoped for.

291
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,461
lt seems that overconfidence

292
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:27,734
comes in small packages
around here.

293
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:30,297
My track record
speaks for itself

294
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,674
just like your security file.

295
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:39,442
Thanks for the drink.

296
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:08,372
Times are difficult.

297
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:09,607
Oh, it's not that.

298
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:10,876
Business was good.

299
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,816
Then why are you shutting down?

300
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:15,684
My husband and l ran
this place for nine years.

301
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,679
Before that, we had
a shop on Bajor for 17.

302
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,125
But a few months ago,
he passed away

303
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:26,858
and my heart's
just not in it anymore.

304
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,957
Not the same, is it?

305
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,434
Working by yourself?

306
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:33,334
No.

307
00:18:33,371 --> 00:18:37,137
lt's so much nicer
working next to someone else.

308
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:50,354
You understand.

309
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:58,922
Nice shot.

310
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:15,175
Damn!

311
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,118
You think l'm stupid, too, hmm?

312
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:23,814
l... don't know
what you're talking about.

313
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:26,016
l don't need your charity.

314
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:28,321
Next time, you either
play your best game

315
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,850
or you don't play.

316
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:39,036
He can't do this.

317
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,560
l have an exclusive contract.

318
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:41,697
l want him arrested.

319
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,367
Who are you talking about?

320
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:45,035
Martus, that listener.

321
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:46,407
What's he done?

322
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:47,911
Just look.

323
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:49,914
Welcome, friends.

324
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:51,245
Welcome, welcome.

325
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:56,083
Welcome to Club Martus.

326
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:11,532
l have a contract

327
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:13,469
for which l paid considerably.

328
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,439
All gambling at DS9

329
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:17,441
happens at Quark's,
or it doesn't happen.

330
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:20,035
A few bribes to the Cardassians
when they ran this place

331
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:21,409
doesn't constitute a contract.

332
00:20:21,446 --> 00:20:22,970
Not in the eyes
of the Federation.

333
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,777
He's a con artist, a crook.

334
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:27,080
One more won't make
much difference.

335
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:28,676
Need l remind you
that without me

336
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,654
the other merchants
would have abandoned

337
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,316
this station
after the occupation.

338
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,517
You owe me!

339
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:36,994
You begged me to stay here
when you first came on board

340
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,496
and l did,
against my better judgment.

341
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,089
l didn't beg.
l blackmailed you.

342
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,326
And don't pretend it hasn't
paid off for you either.

343
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,928
lt's paid off fine until now.

344
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,097
Martus is cutting
into my profits.

345
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,697
l want him stopped,
before it gets any worse.

346
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:53,108
Too late for that, my brother.

347
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,769
What's the meaning of this?

348
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:57,338
l've promised
your underpaid sibling

349
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:00,783
a one-quarter partnership
in my establishment.

350
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:02,810
Make me a better offer.

351
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:05,288
A... a bidding war, over you?

352
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:07,348
Ha, don't make me laugh.

353
00:21:09,094 --> 00:21:10,755
Careful, Martus.

354
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:12,888
He shaves the latinum.

355
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:14,398
l do not.

356
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:15,922
Not much.

357
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,812
Martus?

358
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:36,037
l've just received word

359
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:38,547
the Vlugtan government
has accepted my bid.

360
00:21:38,582 --> 00:21:40,174
Well, that's wonderful.

361
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:43,419
What's wrong?

362
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:45,615
They won't finalize
the transaction

363
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:50,184
until l commission a study on
the effects of asteroid mining

364
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:51,888
on inner-system navigation.

365
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:53,954
All my money is
committed to the bid.

366
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:56,057
l can't afford the study

367
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,226
and l only have
a week to get it done.

368
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,965
How much do you need?

369
00:22:01,005 --> 00:22:03,735
10,000 isiks.

370
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:05,366
10,000 isiks?

371
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,276
lt won't be easy to raise
that kind of money.

372
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:09,279
l know, l know.

373
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:11,781
l hope l can find
an investor in time.

374
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,612
l might know someone.

375
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:15,812
But what kind of return

376
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:18,788
can they expect
on their investment?

377
00:22:18,822 --> 00:22:23,850
Well, once l began mining,
l'd pay back ten times 10,000.

378
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:26,556
Don't worry, Alsia.

379
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:29,725
l'll do everything in my power
to keep your dream alive.

380
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:32,031
Oh, Martus.

381
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:35,596
l don't know how to thank you.

382
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:37,436
ls there some problem, Rom?

383
00:22:37,474 --> 00:22:38,941
Not with this batch

384
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:42,742
but, with my brother around,
you can never be too careful.

385
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,441
You mean to say
he'd poison the canapés?

386
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:45,948
Maybe not poison

387
00:22:45,983 --> 00:22:47,974
but a small intestinal bug?

388
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,849
l wouldn't put it past him.

389
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:51,684
Oh, don't worry about Quark.

390
00:22:51,722 --> 00:22:54,919
l've had the most astonishing
run of luck lately.

391
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,086
l'm beginning to think
l can do no wrong.

392
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:02,698
Neatness counts.

393
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,064
Never think it doesn't.

394
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:10,698
A toast...

395
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:12,800
to the Queen of the Promenade.

396
00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:16,142
A woman whose business
acumen is matched

397
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,671
only by her beauty and charm.

398
00:23:18,716 --> 00:23:20,513
Have l missed anything?

399
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:22,018
To you...

400
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:24,282
my treasure.

401
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:28,384
Are you as pleased as l am?

402
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:30,188
What do you think?

403
00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:32,957
l think we make
quite a good team.

404
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:37,525
Perhaps we should consider
formalizing our relationship.

405
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:41,368
Are you proposing to me?

406
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:44,272
What do you think?

407
00:23:44,308 --> 00:23:47,334
Oh, it's beautiful.

408
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:50,074
You deserve nothing less.

409
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:54,647
And these are wonderful.

410
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,482
Where did you find them?

411
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,987
l had them replicated

412
00:23:58,022 --> 00:24:00,286
from a hand-held version
a friend gave me.

413
00:24:00,324 --> 00:24:02,258
l've never seen
anything like them.

414
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:03,919
No one has.

415
00:24:03,961 --> 00:24:05,485
All right.
ls this everything

416
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:06,894
you'll need for the lab?

417
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,420
l think so.

418
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,727
l don't believe it.

419
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:13,236
Believe what?

420
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,864
l've had the computer looking
for this program for weeks.

421
00:24:15,906 --> 00:24:17,999
lt was buried somewhere
in the deep code level

422
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:19,566
right before
the Cardassians left.

423
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,907
Huh. How did you find it?

424
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:22,844
l'm not sure.
lt's more like it found me.

425
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,472
Just lucky, l guess.

426
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:28,015
l am so sorry.

427
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:29,142
What happened?

428
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:31,211
Well, you served.
l returned low.

429
00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:32,779
You slipped on the ball.

430
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:33,949
l slipped on a ball?

431
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:35,424
Stepped right on it,
mid-flight.

432
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:36,756
Never seen anything like it.

433
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,552
Easy now, let me check you out.

434
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:41,223
l'm fine. Serve.

435
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:43,597
Dr. Bashir,
report to the lnfirmary.

436
00:24:43,634 --> 00:24:46,569
l'm sorry, Chief.
l have to go.

437
00:24:46,603 --> 00:24:48,366
l'll get you next time, okay?

438
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:49,872
Look, about that...

439
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:51,636
lt's just that...
l guess l don't enjoy

440
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:53,142
this game
as much as l used to.

441
00:24:53,177 --> 00:24:54,906
l hope you don't mind.

442
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:56,742
l'm sure you'll find
another opponent.

443
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:18,333
Where is everybody?

444
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:21,735
My friendly competitor's place.

445
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,399
A listener.

446
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,998
So what?

447
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:26,736
So he listens.

448
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:28,404
l can listen.

449
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,675
l can listen as well as anyone.

450
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:32,011
What happened?

451
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:34,381
l fell down.

452
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:35,715
See? l'm listening.

453
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:36,878
Nothing to it.

454
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,410
How did you fall down?

455
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:41,424
Playing racquetball with Bashir.

456
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,982
Where?

457
00:25:43,026 --> 00:25:45,358
At the court.
Where do you think?

458
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:47,022
What was the score?

459
00:25:47,064 --> 00:25:48,031
Who cares?

460
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:49,225
l care. l'm listening.

461
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:50,733
Tell me your problems.
All of them.

462
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:53,429
l've got no problems
a good drop shot wouldn't cure.

463
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,437
He beat you.

464
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,029
Only by half a step, that's all.

465
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,665
He's got a few years on me,
so what?

466
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:00,540
l've got more experience.

467
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:02,044
The aging champion...

468
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:04,070
l've got spin shots
he's never seen.

469
00:26:04,114 --> 00:26:05,741
...versus the daring challenger.

470
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:07,374
So l had a few bad breaks, huh?

471
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,282
One more game,
that's all l needed.

472
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,377
Come one, come all...

473
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,513
l could have kicked him
all over the court

474
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:13,580
and he knows it, too.

475
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:14,784
Welcome to Quark's.

476
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,725
Thanks.

477
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,625
Don't mention it.

478
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:23,190
Quark's House of Champions.

479
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:24,200
Damn!

480
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:25,360
Something wrong, Major?

481
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:26,892
My terminal just
self-destructed.

482
00:26:26,937 --> 00:26:28,131
What?

483
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,902
l lost an evaluation report
l've been working on for weeks.

484
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:31,930
Even the backups?

485
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:33,567
Even the backups.

486
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,408
Funny. l've been hearing
a lot of bad luck stories

487
00:26:36,446 --> 00:26:37,708
in the last few hours.

488
00:26:37,748 --> 00:26:39,010
Doctor Bashir tells me

489
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:40,778
the lnfirmary is full
of minor accidents.

490
00:26:40,817 --> 00:26:42,011
People slipping and falling

491
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:43,383
walking through
turbolift doors

492
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,012
before they open--
that kind of thing.

493
00:26:45,122 --> 00:26:46,589
Well, l've had a great day

494
00:26:46,623 --> 00:26:48,853
so don't try sending
your misfortunes my way.

495
00:26:48,892 --> 00:26:50,291
Come on, you make
your own luck.

496
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:52,761
We all know that.

497
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:07,365
They all hit the jackpot
at once?

498
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:10,539
ls there any way
l can blame this on you?

499
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:12,208
l don't think so.

500
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:13,876
No, l suppose not.

501
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:17,296
All right.
Pay them all off.

502
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:20,364
Challenge of the Galaxy.

503
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,529
Match of the Century.

504
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:29,405
Wonder of the Wormhole.

505
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,741
House always takes blue.

506
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,949
lf it's action you want,
you've come to the right place.

507
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,720
Excitement?
We've got it all.

508
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,526
Thrills and spills.
Victory and defeat.

509
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:54,555
Look no further,
we've got it all.

510
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,764
And here he is-- the reigning
champion of Starfleet--

511
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:00,795
a legend on both sides
of the wormhole.

512
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,704
Ladies and gentlemen

513
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:05,574
Miles ''The Mechanic'' O'Brien.

514
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:11,309
What's this all about?

515
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,215
l got an emergency call.

516
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:14,879
Well, so did l

517
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,945
but l don't see any emergency.

518
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:18,955
And the challenger.

519
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:22,891
He's fast, he's deadly,
he's Julian Bashir.

520
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:25,761
They call him ''The Doctor.''

521
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:29,063
The grudge match of the galaxy.

522
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:31,228
Get down here.

523
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,636
And all for a worthy cause.

524
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:36,903
Yes, these noble competitors
have insisted

525
00:28:36,942 --> 00:28:40,070
that l donate half
the house's winnings

526
00:28:40,112 --> 00:28:42,672
to the Bajoran Fund for Orphans.

527
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:44,443
Orphans?

528
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:48,913
The Mechanic versus The Doctor.

529
00:28:48,954 --> 00:28:50,922
Tomorrow, 1200 hours.

530
00:28:50,956 --> 00:28:55,689
Only one will emerge victorious,
so place your bets

531
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:59,686
and in the meantime,
the tables are open.

532
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:01,596
This is outrageous.

533
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:04,500
We haven't agreed to anything.

534
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:05,833
As your exclusive promoter

535
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:07,930
l have the right
to arrange matches as l see fit.

536
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,200
Exclusive promoter?

537
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:10,503
Just sign here.

538
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,770
Forget it, Quark.

539
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:18,215
l understand how you feel,
but... think of the children.

540
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,946
The monks have already
made a down payment

541
00:29:20,986 --> 00:29:22,954
on new blankets for the winter.

542
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:26,081
Ah, well, l'm sure
the little ones

543
00:29:26,124 --> 00:29:28,786
can huddle together for warmth.

544
00:29:31,096 --> 00:29:35,430
Looks like you're going to get
that rematch after all.

545
00:30:03,495 --> 00:30:04,826
l don't believe it.

546
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:07,423
The program l found--
it disappeared.

547
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:09,764
Have you checked
the deep code level?

548
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:10,768
No luck.

549
00:30:10,802 --> 00:30:11,996
lt's funny.

550
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:14,733
lt's like the computer brought
that program up at random

551
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:17,367
and then just swallowed
it up again.

552
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:19,001
Major, you're all right.

553
00:30:19,077 --> 00:30:21,272
Not even a sprain,
which is more than l can say

554
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:22,974
for everybody else
in the lnfirmary.

555
00:30:23,015 --> 00:30:24,573
Still crowded?

556
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,982
Yeah, and Doctor Bashir tells me
it's a whole new batch.

557
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:28,008
More minor accidents?

558
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:29,178
Dozens of them.

559
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:31,951
Could there be a connection
between the accidents

560
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,686
and the increase
in the system failures?

561
00:30:34,726 --> 00:30:36,921
l didn't get hurt
by a system failure

562
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:38,361
l tripped and fell.

563
00:30:38,397 --> 00:30:40,957
Just coincidence, that's all.

564
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:43,900
There must be a logical
explanation for all this.

565
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:46,803
Maybe a virus or some kind
of spatial disruption.

566
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:48,806
lt would have to be something

567
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,138
that would affect
both people and machinery.

568
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:52,609
Get on it.

569
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:58,641
l always had smaller lobes
than the rest of the boys.

570
00:30:58,684 --> 00:31:00,276
They used to tease me about it.

571
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,616
Quark was the worst.

572
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,416
He told everyone l was adopted.

573
00:31:03,455 --> 00:31:06,083
l just don't understand.
Things were going so well.

574
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:08,149
On my Naming Day,
Quark substituted

575
00:31:08,193 --> 00:31:10,491
old vegetables for my presents.

576
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:11,689
Then he sold the presents

577
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,493
for more than our father
had paid...

578
00:31:13,532 --> 00:31:17,628
l couldn't care less
about your trivial childhood!

579
00:31:20,806 --> 00:31:25,368
We've been virtually abandoned
and l want to know why.

580
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,742
A bad streak-- it happens.

581
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,804
Not to me, it doesn't.

582
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,509
l require the comfort

583
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,518
of a compassionate soul.

584
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:39,984
Don't think l didn't see
through you

585
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:42,425
right from the start.

586
00:31:43,595 --> 00:31:45,722
lt's a joke.
Really.

587
00:31:45,764 --> 00:31:47,026
Well, in case

588
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:50,296
you've forgotten, l still
hold the lease on this place.

589
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:52,860
l want you out of here
by tomorrow

590
00:31:52,904 --> 00:31:55,634
and take those damn things
with you.

591
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:58,507
But... but...
but...

592
00:31:59,778 --> 00:32:01,405
But, treasure.

593
00:32:01,446 --> 00:32:03,971
Oh, l knew no good
would come of this.

594
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:05,643
l never should have left Quark.

595
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:07,276
What's going to happen now?

596
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,684
l'm not sure.

597
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:14,784
But l have an idea.

598
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,700
The profits from the club.

599
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:31,641
l believe it comes
to just about 10,000 isiks.

600
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:35,841
Oh, Martus, you don't know
what this means to me.

601
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:38,008
l know what it means to me--

602
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,382
ten times as much in return.

603
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:42,319
You won't regret this.

604
00:32:42,354 --> 00:32:44,982
You'll see.
We'll both be rich.

605
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:08,441
You can beat his backhand.

606
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,072
Keep the ball low

607
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,707
and to his left.

608
00:33:14,386 --> 00:33:16,820
Corner return on the serve.

609
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,619
Then kill shot left.

610
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:25,721
lf he returns again

611
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:29,222
high back wall.

612
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:30,894
And remember...

613
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:34,838
Win or lose,
tonight we celebrate.

614
00:33:40,746 --> 00:33:42,976
Miles, wait.

615
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:49,315
A silk handkerchief

616
00:33:49,354 --> 00:33:53,620
medieval Japanese design...

617
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:56,718
scented with my perfume.

618
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,560
Kick his butt.

619
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:14,971
Doctor, l brought you something.

620
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:18,447
A token of thanks from the monks
to show you how much

621
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:19,950
they appreciate
your participation

622
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:21,213
in their little fund-raiser.

623
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:22,584
Oh, thanks.
Put it over there.

624
00:34:22,621 --> 00:34:26,113
Um, aren't you going
to try some?

625
00:34:26,158 --> 00:34:27,625
What is it?

626
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,253
The monks tell me
it's a medicinal brew--

627
00:34:30,295 --> 00:34:32,525
an ancient secret
of their order.

628
00:34:32,564 --> 00:34:35,533
lt's supposed to impart
great energy and vigor.

629
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:40,129
Just the kind of thing to have
before an athletic competition.

630
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:44,575
But... you're
a man of science.

631
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:47,544
You probably don't believe
in folk medicine.

632
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:48,978
Actually, you'd be surprised

633
00:34:49,014 --> 00:34:50,845
just how often
traditional medicine

634
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:52,873
turns out to have genuine value.

635
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:54,579
Did they say
what was in this stuff?

636
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:55,813
They didn't exactly

637
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:58,448
but l'm sure it's all
completely natural.

638
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,754
Oh, the monks said
you should drink the whole thing

639
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,885
in one gulp in order
to get the proper effect.

640
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:04,725
Did they?

641
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,454
What are you doing?

642
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:12,728
Just curious about its contents.

643
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:15,065
Uh... what about your exercises?

644
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:16,660
This won't take a second.

645
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:17,932
Oh, why bother?

646
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,939
Don't you trust the monks?

647
00:35:21,008 --> 00:35:23,374
Ah, water, sucrose, dextrose

648
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:25,140
tribnel root extract

649
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:28,740
grain particulates,
yeast, synthehol...

650
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:30,876
and 17 milligrams

651
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:35,412
of hyvroxilated
quint-ethyl metacetamine.

652
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:37,424
Like l said, all natural.

653
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,619
lt's an anesthetic, Quark.

654
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,787
lf l drank that,
l'd hardly be able to stand

655
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:43,160
let alone play racquetball.

656
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:45,062
You were trying to fix
the match, weren't you?

657
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,327
Would l do that?

658
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:49,097
lf you had enough latinum bet
on Chief O'Brien, you would.

659
00:35:49,136 --> 00:35:52,071
No one's betting
on Chief O'Brien.

660
00:35:52,106 --> 00:35:53,095
All the money's on you.

661
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,869
lf you win, there
won't be any profits.

662
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:57,742
And if there aren't any profits

663
00:35:57,778 --> 00:36:01,236
l can't donate
anything to the monks.

664
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:06,242
No donations, no winter blankets
for the children.

665
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:12,817
But... if you lose,
then the house would win

666
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,795
and the monks would
get their blankets.

667
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,856
Are you suggesting
that l throw the match?

668
00:36:20,768 --> 00:36:21,928
For the children.

669
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:22,935
Forget it, Quark.

670
00:36:23,037 --> 00:36:24,334
But the blankets...

671
00:36:24,372 --> 00:36:26,272
Will be provided by you
one way or another.

672
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:28,298
And if the monks don't get
their blankets

673
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:30,435
Chief O'Brien and l
will be very upset.

674
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:32,241
Do l make myself clear?

675
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,248
Perfectly.

676
00:36:34,282 --> 00:36:39,584
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l have a match to play.

677
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:48,686
Kira said you've found
something.

678
00:36:48,729 --> 00:36:50,128
Oh, l found something,
all right.

679
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:51,654
l just don't know what it means.

680
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:52,791
Look at this.

681
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,198
Solar neutrinos.

682
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:55,361
Notice anything unusual?

683
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:56,802
There are a lot of them?

684
00:36:56,837 --> 00:36:58,429
The spin.

685
00:36:58,472 --> 00:37:01,236
Given the laws of probability,
from any point of view

686
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:04,574
about half of them
should be spinning clockwise

687
00:37:04,612 --> 00:37:07,080
and the other half
counterclockwise.

688
00:37:07,114 --> 00:37:10,208
But over 80% of them
are spinning clockwise.

689
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:12,048
You're saying people
are having accidents

690
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:15,544
because of the way
the neutrinos are spinning?

691
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:19,048
No, but l think it's a symptom
of the same problem.

692
00:37:19,093 --> 00:37:22,062
The neutrinos outside
the station are normal

693
00:37:22,096 --> 00:37:23,688
but inside the station

694
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:26,700
something very strange
is going on.

695
00:37:26,734 --> 00:37:28,395
Have a good game, Julian.

696
00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:29,926
You, too.

697
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,413
First point, O'Brien,
breaking the serve

698
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,782
and so it begins.

699
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,655
2-0, O'Brien.

700
00:37:57,698 --> 00:38:00,223
Not a rousing start
for The Doctor.

701
00:38:01,902 --> 00:38:03,529
Where is she?

702
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:05,198
Who?

703
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:07,867
Alsia. She was supposed
to meet me here

704
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:09,705
to tell me how the bid went.

705
00:38:09,744 --> 00:38:11,211
l still don't think it's fair

706
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:13,042
you investing my money
without asking.

707
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,604
Your money?

708
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:16,480
You promised me
one-quarter of the profits

709
00:38:16,517 --> 00:38:18,508
but then you gave her
everything we earned.

710
00:38:18,552 --> 00:38:21,885
l promised you one-quarter
of the profits after expenses.

711
00:38:21,922 --> 00:38:25,050
Expenses?
What expenses?

712
00:38:25,092 --> 00:38:28,687
Operating costs, overhead,
recapitalization.

713
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:31,857
Ooh, that does it.

714
00:38:33,634 --> 00:38:34,896
Where are you going?

715
00:38:34,935 --> 00:38:35,924
Back to Quark.

716
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,370
At least then
l'll get cheated by family.

717
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:40,533
Let's get out of here.

718
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:51,585
Ooh, another bad break
for Bashir.

719
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:54,782
9-3, O'Brien.

720
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:57,950
Quark, l'm cutting
the transmission.

721
00:38:58,059 --> 00:38:59,686
What? You can't.

722
00:38:59,727 --> 00:39:01,126
Watch me.

723
00:39:03,664 --> 00:39:06,292
Ladies and gentlemen

724
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:09,302
the players have called
a three-minute break.

725
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:10,894
Betting is reopened.

726
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:13,338
Three minutes,
three minutes only.

727
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:14,534
Why did you do that?

728
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:16,042
Something's wrong here.

729
00:39:16,077 --> 00:39:19,376
With me, maybe,
but you're having a great game.

730
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:21,438
Yeah, the best l've played
my entire life.

731
00:39:21,482 --> 00:39:23,916
l'm making shots l couldn't
have made 15 years ago

732
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:26,385
when l was playing
five hours a day, every day.

733
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,047
l can't miss.

734
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:31,650
And l can't hit the broadside
of a Plygorian mammoth.

735
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:34,422
Try throwing the ball
against the wall.

736
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:42,061
lt should have come
straight back to me.

737
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:43,764
You try.

738
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,952
O'Brien to Ops.

739
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:16,459
lt goes right into his hand
every single time.

740
00:40:16,504 --> 00:40:18,369
l must have done it
a dozen times by now

741
00:40:18,405 --> 00:40:19,667
and l haven't missed yet.

742
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:20,969
Nobody could be that lucky.

743
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:22,441
lt's impossible.

744
00:40:22,476 --> 00:40:24,467
Not impossible,
just extremely improbable.

745
00:40:24,512 --> 00:40:26,139
lmprobable?

746
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,978
Like the neutrinos on the
station spinning the same way

747
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:32,110
or a few dozen people
having minor accidents

748
00:40:32,153 --> 00:40:33,552
at the same instant

749
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:36,283
or a system failing
just at the wrong time.

750
00:40:36,323 --> 00:40:37,620
Exactly.

751
00:40:37,658 --> 00:40:39,819
Someone or something
on this station

752
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,851
is distorting the laws
of probability.

753
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:43,295
Changing them so incredibly

754
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,745
unlikely things
can happen on a regular basis.

755
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:47,641
How can we find out
what's causing it?

756
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:50,148
l think l know a way.

757
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:57,347
98% of the neutrinos
in this room

758
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,255
are rotating clockwise.

759
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:00,759
The games are open.

760
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:02,727
We're not here to play.
Dax?

761
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:04,286
100% clockwise.

762
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,922
lt's these machines.

763
00:41:05,998 --> 00:41:07,863
What, my gambling machines?

764
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,731
What's wrong with them?

765
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:12,169
Somehow, these machines
are altering

766
00:41:12,205 --> 00:41:14,901
the laws of probability
all over the station.

767
00:41:14,941 --> 00:41:16,738
So, that's what he meant.

768
00:41:16,776 --> 00:41:17,743
Who?

769
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:19,404
The alien who gave me
the original.

770
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:22,073
He said it all came down
to luck.

771
00:41:22,114 --> 00:41:24,548
That must be how it works.

772
00:41:24,584 --> 00:41:26,950
When you win,
it makes you lucky.

773
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:27,951
When you lose...

774
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:29,521
But these machines

775
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:30,886
are affecting
everyone on the station

776
00:41:30,923 --> 00:41:32,254
whether they're playing
them or not.

777
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:34,691
lmpossible.
You must be mistaken.

778
00:41:34,727 --> 00:41:35,921
Wait a minute.

779
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:37,589
You said there was
an original machine?

780
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,961
Yes, a smaller one.

781
00:41:39,065 --> 00:41:42,592
When l opened the club,
l replicated these larger ver...

782
00:41:44,303 --> 00:41:46,271
Larger versions.

783
00:41:47,807 --> 00:41:50,207
So, how do you turn them off?

784
00:41:50,243 --> 00:41:52,734
l'm not completely sure.

785
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:54,871
Then how did you turn them
on in the first place?

786
00:41:54,914 --> 00:41:56,472
l didn't... exactly.

787
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:58,915
l just told the replicator

788
00:41:58,951 --> 00:42:02,318
to scan the original
and make copies.

789
00:42:02,355 --> 00:42:07,258
l think they have some kind
of internal power source.

790
00:42:07,293 --> 00:42:09,056
Lieutenant.

791
00:42:09,095 --> 00:42:12,428
Wait, wait, wait!
What are you doing?

792
00:42:16,402 --> 00:42:17,733
Now, as for you...

793
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,863
You can't possibly blame me
for this, Commander.

794
00:42:19,906 --> 00:42:21,100
Oh, l'd like to.

795
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,870
Unfortunately, l don't have
anything l can charge you with.

796
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,071
Fortunately, l do.

797
00:42:26,112 --> 00:42:28,808
That elderly Pythron
couple you ''assisted''

798
00:42:28,848 --> 00:42:30,782
has had a change of heart.

799
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:33,614
They've decided to
press charges after all.

800
00:42:49,302 --> 00:42:50,667
Alsia!

801
00:42:50,703 --> 00:42:52,864
l knew you'd come to get me out.

802
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:55,738
lnside.

803
00:42:59,445 --> 00:43:01,072
What's the meaning of this?

804
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:02,580
Ask him.

805
00:43:02,615 --> 00:43:05,243
Your lady friend here
just tried to scam me.

806
00:43:05,284 --> 00:43:06,911
Scam?

807
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,316
Asteroid mining.

808
00:43:08,354 --> 00:43:10,686
To think anyone
would be foolish enough

809
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:12,452
to be taken in
by that old trick.

810
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:15,756
But don't worry, Martus,
l've come to get you out.

811
00:43:15,795 --> 00:43:17,922
ln return for what?

812
00:43:17,997 --> 00:43:20,227
Nothing.
Pure generosity.

813
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:21,927
Huh!

814
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:25,933
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

815
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:29,474
Oh, taken in
by one of your own victims

816
00:43:29,508 --> 00:43:31,339
and no one to turn to but me?

817
00:43:32,645 --> 00:43:36,411
l can't remember when l've been
so entertained.

818
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:38,883
l'm glad
you're enjoying yourself.

819
00:43:38,918 --> 00:43:41,409
Now, how about
giving me 2,000 isiks

820
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:43,547
to book passage out of here?

821
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:47,616
You want me to give you money?

822
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,628
Ridiculous.

823
00:43:49,662 --> 00:43:54,326
Of all the ungrateful arrogance.

824
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:58,030
Unless you want me
to stay here on the station.

825
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:01,873
All right.

826
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:05,809
l'll loan you 500 isiks.

827
00:44:05,845 --> 00:44:08,507
You can book passage
on a cargo ship.

828
00:44:08,547 --> 00:44:11,482
1,500.
After all, l do have expenses.

829
00:44:11,517 --> 00:44:13,007
600.

830
00:44:13,052 --> 00:44:15,714
1,200.
l still have my dignity.

831
00:44:15,755 --> 00:44:18,383
Dignity and an empty sack
is worth the sack--

832
00:44:18,424 --> 00:44:19,721
Rule of Acquisition
Number 109.

833
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:24,389
All right.

834
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,193
800.

835
00:44:26,232 --> 00:44:28,894
Go on.

836
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:31,711
l'm listening.
