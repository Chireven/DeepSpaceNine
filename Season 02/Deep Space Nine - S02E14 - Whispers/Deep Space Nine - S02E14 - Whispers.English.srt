1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,831
Computer,
set heading 410 mark 32.

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,838
Course laid in.

3
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:16,841
Maximum warp.
Engage.

4
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,843
Time to Parada system.

5
00:00:18,877 --> 00:00:21,209
One hour, 14 minutes.

6
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:28,883
Open a new file, computer.

7
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:35,559
O'Brien, Personal Log,
Stardate 47 581.2.

8
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:43,531
l've got to try to set
the record straight

9
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:45,695
about the last 52 hours.

10
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,298
l don't know
who's going to hear this.

11
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,538
l don't even know
if l'll be alive

12
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,604
by the time
this log is recovered.

13
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:01,480
l figure
they'll be coming after me.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,489
lf l'm right
about this whole thing

15
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:08,323
they won't want me
to warn the Paradas.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,796
Coffee, Jamaican blend--
double strong, double sweet.

17
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:17,991
l wish l could tell you
who they are

18
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:22,871
but that's a part of the puzzle
l haven't figured out yet.

19
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:25,900
A part of the puzzle, hell.

20
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:29,710
None of this whole damn thing
makes any sense.

21
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,151
l'm trying to remember

22
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:43,150
the first time l noticed
that things were wrong.

23
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:46,062
lt seems to me it was...

24
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:48,293
Yeah...

25
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,096
it had to be the first morning

26
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:52,103
after l got back
to the station.

27
00:02:10,188 --> 00:02:13,157
What are you two
doing up so early?

28
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:17,821
Um, l had a lot of work
to catch up on at school.

29
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:20,024
Thought l'd get an early start.

30
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:21,999
At 5:30 in the morning?

31
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:25,161
Coffee, Jamaican blend--
double strong, double sweet.

32
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:27,603
l have a dozen essays to read.

33
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:31,836
Did you have sweet dreams,
darling?

34
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:33,845
Go away!

35
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,676
Don't l get my morning kiss?

36
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:37,682
No!

37
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:40,879
Well, what did l do
to deserve that?

38
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,784
lt's just a phase, Miles.

39
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:44,015
She doesn't mean it.

40
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:45,181
Huh?!

41
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:47,657
Don't let it bother you.

42
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:56,860
What time did you
get to bed last night?

43
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:58,665
l don't know-- late.

44
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:00,637
l didn't want to wake you.

45
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:01,798
l was tired.

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,139
l guess that trip
really took it out of me.

47
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:07,145
What did they have you doing?

48
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:08,476
The Paradas?

49
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:10,640
They put me
through basic training

50
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:12,149
on all the security measures

51
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:14,675
they want in place
for the peace talks.

52
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,744
Odo would have had a field day.

53
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:18,813
l wish he could have been there.

54
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:20,825
l'd better get going.

55
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,885
l'll drop Molly at day care
on the way to Ops.

56
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:25,487
Uh, that's okay.

57
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,157
l'm taking her with me.
Molly?

58
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,666
What? To school?

59
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,691
When you've got
all that reading to do?

60
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,498
That doesn't make
a lot of sense.

61
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:34,505
There's something
l want to show her.

62
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:35,801
Uh, a Vulcan program

63
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,968
that teaches basic
problem-solving skills.

64
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,705
At 5:30 in the morning?

65
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:43,179
l want to do it
while her mind is fresh.

66
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:46,012
Oh, if you say so.

67
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,746
See you later.

68
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:13,310
What's this?

69
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:15,711
Just getting a head start,
Chief.

70
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:18,045
Head start?
Everybody seems to be getting

71
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,017
a head start on me today.

72
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,484
Sir?

73
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,957
DeCurtis, l appreciate
your bushy-tailed enthusiasm

74
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,458
but l was waiting for Odo

75
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:29,551
to come back from Bajor
to do this.

76
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:32,062
We have to realign
the entire security net

77
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:33,291
for the peace talks.

78
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:34,764
The Constable might have

79
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,733
a few things
to say about it all.

80
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:40,101
Commander Sisko didn't feel
we should wait for Odo.

81
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:42,868
Sisko gave you permission
to start this

82
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,637
without asking me first?

83
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:45,904
l don't think so.

84
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:48,310
You might want to check
with him, sir.

85
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:49,779
l'm only following orders.

86
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:52,840
l'll check with him, all right.

87
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:54,511
Mr. O'Brien?

88
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,517
Carry on!

89
00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:32,804
Computer, how much longer
to Parada system?

90
00:07:32,842 --> 00:07:34,707
53 minutes.

91
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:37,474
Direct sensors
back toward the wormhole.

92
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:41,074
Scan for other warp signatures
on this heading.

93
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:42,982
One warp signature found.

94
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:45,749
Display.

95
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:48,086
Can you identify?

96
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:51,422
ldentification confirmed:
Starfleet Runabout <i>Mekong.</i>

97
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:52,826
Ah, l figured as much.

98
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:56,821
They'll wait for me
to drop out of warp and then...

99
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:59,096
Well, we'll have
to cross that bridge

100
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:01,102
when we come to it, won't we?

101
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:02,764
Please restate question.

102
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:05,706
Oh, disregard, computer.

103
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,441
Continue Personal Log.

104
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:15,214
Okay...

105
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:19,620
So, it was all a little curious

106
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:22,317
but who could have guessed
at that time?

107
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:24,792
l mean, the way they were acting

108
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:27,159
they might have been trying
to pull off

109
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:30,063
one of those surprise parties
that l can't stand.

110
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,431
Only my birthday's
not until September

111
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:34,368
and, believe me,
as it turned out

112
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:37,566
l had nothing else to celebrate.

113
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:38,574
Ah, there he is now.

114
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:39,973
l've been waiting for you,
Chief.

115
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:40,976
What is it, Julian?

116
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,170
No more excuses this time.

117
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:43,178
Excuses?

118
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:44,804
l'd like you
in my office in an hour.

119
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:45,814
For what?

120
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:46,940
Your physical.

121
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:48,416
You can't put this off
any longer.

122
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:49,645
Look, this isn't a good day.

123
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:50,777
lt's the perfect day.

124
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,380
Commander Sisko has arranged
to have you covered.

125
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:55,083
What are you doing,
going to the Commander

126
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:56,091
about my checkup?

127
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:57,682
Because this has been...

128
00:08:57,727 --> 00:08:59,490
l know how you feel about...

129
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:00,928
Forget it.

130
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:02,590
l've got things to do.

131
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:04,600
l'm afraid l'll have to insist.

132
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:07,262
lf l have to order you
as your superior officer

133
00:09:07,303 --> 00:09:08,429
l will.

134
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:09,995
ls there a problem?

135
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:16,209
Mr. O'Brien says
he's unavailable for a physical.

136
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:17,974
Make yourself available, Chief.

137
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:19,811
-Commander...
-Dr. Bashir's annual report

138
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:23,285
on the senior staff is due
at Starfleet next week.

139
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:25,947
We've all had
to go through this.

140
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:29,116
Fine. Fine.
l'll be there in an hour.

141
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:36,588
Commander, can l talk
to you for a minute?

142
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:44,638
Ensign DeCurtis mentioned to me
that you were a little upset.

143
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:46,039
Well, not upset, exactly.

144
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:48,168
No, no, no.
You have every right to be.

145
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,645
l'm sorry l assigned him
before advising you.

146
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,807
l guess l dropped
the ball on that one.

147
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:54,008
Well, l guess l just felt

148
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,984
a little left out
of the loop, you know?

149
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:57,315
Understood.

150
00:09:57,353 --> 00:09:59,651
l've gone through your reports
on the Paradas.

151
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:01,816
They seem unusually preoccupied
with security.

152
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:03,825
Well, they may be
a little paranoid

153
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:05,520
but l suppose we would be, too

154
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:08,428
if we'd been engaged
in a civil war for 12 years.

155
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:12,259
Anything else l should
know about them?

156
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:13,495
Any unusual protocols

157
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:15,504
we should observe
when they get here?

158
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:17,335
No, nothing
too out of the ordinary.

159
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:18,806
lt's all pretty much
in my report.

160
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:23,107
Now, tell me something
that's not in the report.

161
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:24,645
Sir?

162
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,114
You know, the kinds of things
we don't include in reports

163
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:28,650
but might help me
in these talks.

164
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:31,619
Well, l'd have to give it
some thought.

165
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:34,384
Well, there was one thing
l noticed.

166
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:37,915
Well, l don't know if it means
anything or not

167
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,121
but the Paradas have an odor

168
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:43,632
from some kind of skin
excretions, l'd guess.

169
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,258
lt changes with their moods.

170
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:48,498
When they're upset, it can get
pretty strong, actually.

171
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:51,870
Oh, well, l'll try
not to get them upset.

172
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:53,568
Good idea.

173
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:55,804
Their leaders have been
in regular contact with us.

174
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:57,369
l've assured them
we'll be following

175
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:59,711
all of their security
recommendations to the letter.

176
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:02,013
l'll see to that.

177
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:04,019
Well, l certainly want you
to check everything

178
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,918
before they get here,
but the up-front work

179
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:07,547
can be done
by the engineering crews.

180
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,955
l have bigger problems for you.

181
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:10,754
Bigger?

182
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,023
All three upper pylons
are down again.

183
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:14,256
Well, that's impossible.

184
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:17,095
l went over that repair work
when l got back.

185
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:20,532
The pressure locks seemed
to be at maximum efficiency.

186
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:21,695
You'd better check again.

187
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:23,295
We had to tow in
a Bolian freighter

188
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,670
to a lower dock this morning.

189
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:27,505
Well, it can't be anything
that serious.

190
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:30,273
l rebuilt
that entire subsystem myself.

191
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:32,110
l'll get on it right away.

192
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:34,512
After your physical.

193
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,108
Yes, sir.

194
00:11:36,218 --> 00:11:39,016
By the way,
l noticed you and Keiko

195
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:42,286
out in front of the school
this morning, talking.

196
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:43,883
ls there anything wrong?

197
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:47,327
Oh, Jake is having some problems
with his grades.

198
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,263
Oh, l'm sorry to hear that, sir.

199
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:50,993
Keiko's very fond of the boy.

200
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:54,002
l'm sure she'll work
that much harder to help him.

201
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:55,560
l'm sure she will.

202
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:09,779
Are you nearly finished?

203
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:13,516
l believe you've poked
into every orifice in my body

204
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:15,524
and created a few new ones.

205
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:18,220
Any dizziness?
Oversleeping?

206
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,660
Lack of energy?
Euphoria?

207
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:21,788
Yes! All of them!

208
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:24,095
Especially euphoria,
lots of euphoria!

209
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,667
Seriously.

210
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,862
Look, if you are determined
to keep me here

211
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:29,837
until you find
something wrong with me

212
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:31,840
l'll see if l can't grow you
a hangnail!

213
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:33,501
Eye problems?
Hearing? Headaches?

214
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,941
Headache-- there you go!

215
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:38,003
ln fact, l'm getting
a very bad one right now.

216
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:39,776
Short temper.

217
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:43,080
Flies off the handle under
the slightest provocation--

218
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,848
perfectly normal behavior.

219
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:46,855
Ah, l'm glad
you're enjoying this.

220
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:49,517
Sorry. l know how you feel
about doctors.

221
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:52,118
lt's not doctors
l have a problem with.

222
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:53,855
lt's you, Julian.

223
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:56,126
Well, your sense of humor
seems normal enough.

224
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:57,699
l don't have a sense of humor.

225
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:58,757
Cough.

226
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:00,963
How's the sex life?

227
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,971
l don't have a sense of humor.

228
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:03,994
Cough!

229
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:07,070
Everything all right
in that department?

230
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:10,976
That department is none of
Starfleet's business, or yours.

231
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:12,674
Mother and father
in good health?

232
00:13:12,715 --> 00:13:13,875
Oh, come on, Julian!

233
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,747
You knew my mother died
two years ago.

234
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:16,809
Did l?

235
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:18,820
You don't remember me
telling you

236
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:20,822
when my father
remarried last spring?

237
00:13:20,856 --> 00:13:24,883
Me blathering on about this
woman l've never met before?

238
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:26,724
Of course.

239
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:28,662
Now l remember.

240
00:13:28,697 --> 00:13:29,994
Are you finished?

241
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:31,329
Not quite.

242
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:32,834
l just have

243
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:34,961
one or two more tests to run.

244
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:37,370
This is insane.

245
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:41,103
l haven't had a physical
take this long since l was born.

246
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:43,441
Look, unless l'm dying
or something

247
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,242
l think it's about time...

248
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:47,511
Wait.

249
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,108
That's it, isn't it?

250
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:53,018
l mean, there is
something wrong with me.

251
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:55,353
That's why everybody seems
so strange.

252
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:58,588
Relax, Chief.

253
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:01,562
l'm giving you
a clean bill of health.

254
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:03,224
You can get dressed.

255
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,809
Hey, Chief!

256
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:19,818
Hello, Jake.

257
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:20,910
l need a favor.

258
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:21,942
Sure, what is it?

259
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,614
l'm working
on a subspace transceiver

260
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,317
for my science project,
but l can't seem to figure out

261
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:28,155
how to get the emitter
crystal to work.

262
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:29,626
Subspace transceiver model--

263
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,255
l used to build them
when l was your age.

264
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,662
l'll be glad to help.

265
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:35,633
You don't think
it's a conflict of interest

266
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,794
or anything-- you being
married to the teacher?

267
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,394
Oh, we'll have to clear it
with Keiko

268
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:40,700
but l don't think she'll mind.

269
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,172
Besides, it's a chance
to help get

270
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,799
those grades of yours back up,
right?

271
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:44,968
Oh, my grades are great.

272
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,001
l just want to keep them
that way.

273
00:14:56,922 --> 00:15:00,016
Sisko was telling the truth
about one thing:

274
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:02,026
The upper pylons
had failed again.

275
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:03,560
lt didn't make any sense

276
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:06,223
because the new pressure locks
l'd installed

277
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:08,028
seemed to be working just fine

278
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,500
so it had to be
an entirely new problem.

279
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:13,334
l realized it wasn't going
to be a quick matter

280
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,033
to track it down, after all.

281
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:16,768
And l couldn't help thinking

282
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:19,038
how this was going
to keep me occupied

283
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:22,842
while the security arrangements
for the Paradas were underway.

284
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,213
How's it coming, DeCurtis?

285
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:33,315
Chief, l thought
you had your hands full

286
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:34,518
with the upper pylons.

287
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,585
l do, but l thought
l'd take a break

288
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:37,925
check in on your progress.

289
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:40,591
Everything's on schedule here.
We made a complete sweep

290
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:42,759
of all the quarters
assigned to the Paradas.

291
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:43,893
Good. Open it up.

292
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:45,528
l'd like to look it over myself.

293
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:46,538
l can't, Chief...

294
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,233
That's an order!

295
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:50,673
Sir, the security seal
was activated

296
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,176
the minute we left.

297
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:54,805
Only Major Kira
has the access codes.

298
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:56,973
O'Brien to Kira.

299
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:58,505
Go ahead, Chief.

300
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,815
l'd like the access codes
to the Parada quarters.

301
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:04,321
Chief, what are you doing
down there?

302
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:07,450
Commander, l spent
the last week going over

303
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:10,120
these arrangements
with the Paradas.

304
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:11,629
l really need to be...

305
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:14,029
l want those upper pylons
operational, Chief.

306
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:15,690
That's your priority.

307
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:17,565
Understood?

308
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,764
Yes, sir.

309
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,694
Chief!

310
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:53,364
ls this the right inverter
for the subspace transceiver?

311
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:56,568
Where did you get this?

312
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:59,270
l haven't seen one of these
since l was a kid.

313
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,403
l replicated it.

314
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:01,605
l found the design

315
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,274
in a really,
really old data file

316
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,646
in the library program.

317
00:17:04,683 --> 00:17:05,911
Really, really old?

318
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:07,009
Oh, l didn't mean that...

319
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:08,417
Don't worry about it.

320
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:10,785
Why don't you come by
my place tonight after dinner?

321
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,949
We'll see if we can add
the rest of the pieces.

322
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,458
Oh, that's great.

323
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,360
Jake, did anything unusual
happen here at the station

324
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:19,523
when l was
in the Gamma Quadrant last?

325
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:21,623
Jake, your father's
been looking for you.

326
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,259
l think he's back
in your quarters.

327
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:25,793
lt may be important.

328
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,600
See you later.

329
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:30,039
Everything under control, Chief?

330
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:32,676
Under control, Major.

331
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:40,548
l worked on the pylon controls
the better part of the day.

332
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:43,554
''A needle in a haystack''
wouldn't do this job justice.

333
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:46,887
When l finally found the crack
in the RF power conduit.

334
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:49,621
l couldn't imagine
how it could have occurred

335
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:50,889
so deep in the system

336
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:53,489
unless someone had broken
it deliberately.

337
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,504
Hard day?

338
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,339
Oh, yeah, you could say that.

339
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,504
You want to lie down
before dinner?

340
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,014
No, Jake's coming over
in a little while.

341
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:13,016
l promised to help him
with his science project.

342
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:15,019
Uh, Commander Sisko just called.

343
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:16,748
Jake can't make it tonight.

344
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:18,187
He isn't feeling well.

345
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,383
Really?

346
00:18:19,424 --> 00:18:21,153
He seemed okay a few hours ago.

347
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:23,855
Well, you know
how it is with kids.

348
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,523
He probably just
ate too much junk

349
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,863
on the Promenade after school.

350
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,197
Where's Molly?

351
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:34,069
She's over at the Fredricksons
spending the night.

352
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:44,079
So, there's just
the two of us, then.

353
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,478
We'd better eat while
the food's still warm.

354
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:52,388
Well, the replicator
can keep it warm

355
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,858
and l can keep you warm.

356
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:03,891
What's the problem?

357
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,165
No problem.

358
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:09,002
Um, l'm just not in the mood.

359
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,372
l had a hard day, too.

360
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:17,913
Okay, we'll eat.

361
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:24,382
What is it?

362
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:26,015
Fricandeau stew.

363
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:28,355
But you don't like
fricandeau stew.

364
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:29,451
You do.

365
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:30,859
Yeah, but...

366
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:34,229
l just thought you'd appreciate
one of your favorite meals.

367
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:37,633
l know how you hate all that
terrible food when you're away.

368
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:43,835
A little endive salad,
sweet flan for dessert.

369
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,843
How thoughtful of you.

370
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:51,607
You're not having any?

371
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:55,177
l just feel like having salad.

372
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,619
You're not hungry?

373
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,680
l had a late lunch.

374
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:16,232
How is it?

375
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,888
You know,
l think l will lie down.

376
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:35,085
But you haven't eaten a bite.

377
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,494
Ah, l just don't seem
to have an appetite right now.

378
00:20:43,468 --> 00:20:45,459
l don't know if there was

379
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:47,665
anything wrong with the stew
or not.

380
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,606
When l went back later to check

381
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:51,939
she'd already put it
into the disposal.

382
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:54,673
But all l could think of,
as l looked at her

383
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:58,149
was that this was not my Keiko.

384
00:21:10,764 --> 00:21:12,755
Computer...

385
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:19,600
open O'Brien Personal Log.

386
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:22,631
Play back the last sentence.

387
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:26,612
...but all l could think of
as l looked at her

388
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:29,638
was that this was not my Keiko.

389
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:34,981
You're right.

390
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:37,581
She wasn't.

391
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:42,718
Continue log.

392
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:48,063
l didn't get much sleep
that night.

393
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:50,762
l waited for Keiko--
or whoever she was--

394
00:21:50,804 --> 00:21:53,272
to go to bed,
and l started my search.

395
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:55,866
l had no idea
what l was looking for--

396
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:58,742
something odd,
something not quite normal

397
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:01,679
anything to explain
what might be going on.

398
00:22:01,715 --> 00:22:03,842
Scan complete.

399
00:22:03,883 --> 00:22:07,011
No unknown microorganisms
detected.

400
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,680
Check for traces
of any chemical agents

401
00:22:09,723 --> 00:22:11,520
with bioactive properties.

402
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:15,358
No chemical agents with
bioactive properties detected.

403
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:17,420
Any unknown chemical agents?

404
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:19,295
Negative.

405
00:22:19,332 --> 00:22:22,301
Access internal EM sensor grid.

406
00:22:22,335 --> 00:22:24,132
Ready.

407
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,936
Scan for any evidence
of subharmonic transmissions.

408
00:22:27,974 --> 00:22:29,271
Scan complete.

409
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,607
No subharmonic
transmissions detected.

410
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:34,011
Any unusual
neural wave patterns?

411
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:35,309
Negative.

412
00:22:35,348 --> 00:22:37,839
Any telepathic activity
on board?

413
00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:39,215
Negative.

414
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:46,483
Computer, display
all arriving vessels

415
00:22:46,526 --> 00:22:50,656
from Stardate 47 550
through 47 57 1.

416
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:57,532
None from the Gamma Quadrant?

417
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,061
No ships arrived
from the Gamma Quadrant

418
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,267
within time parameters
requested.

419
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:16,184
Coffee, Jamaican blend,
double strong, double sweet.

420
00:23:23,797 --> 00:23:27,528
You're drinking too much
of this stuff, O'Brien.

421
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:30,035
Anything to stay alert, O'Brien.

422
00:23:34,908 --> 00:23:41,313
Okay, computer, play back
station logs chronologically

423
00:23:41,348 --> 00:23:44,840
starting with stardate 47 550.

424
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:48,615
ldentify which officers' logs
are to be included.

425
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:53,182
All officers.

426
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:55,421
Vocal or transcribed?

427
00:23:55,462 --> 00:23:56,690
Vocal.

428
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,392
Station Log, Stardate 47 552.9.

429
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:02,401
Admiral Gupta has arrived
to personally assess

430
00:24:02,435 --> 00:24:04,995
the Cardassian movements
along the border.

431
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:08,097
Several Federation colonies
in the demilitarized zone

432
00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:09,665
have complained of...

433
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:12,405
...discovered a new life-form
previously unreported.

434
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:15,005
We have tentatively classified
it as a protozoic species...

435
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:17,606
...lost in a shuttlepod
somewhere in the vicinity

436
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,015
of the third moon of Bajor Vll.

437
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,586
We have two runabouts to use...

438
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,520
...a request
by the Chamber of Ministers

439
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:23,988
that l find
absolutely ridiculous.

440
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:25,217
They have actually requested

441
00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:26,919
that we begin to screen
all arriving...

442
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,757
...were completed at 1700 hours

443
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:31,389
and seemed to be functioning
with no further difficulties.

444
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:32,591
A level-1 diagnostic...

445
00:24:32,632 --> 00:24:34,759
...The Admiral seemed satisfied

446
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:37,292
that the Cardassians
would not violate the treaty.

447
00:24:38,638 --> 00:24:39,935
Access denied.

448
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:43,702
Denied?

449
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:47,310
Access denied to what?

450
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:53,752
Station Logs after Stardate
47 569.4 are restricted.

451
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:56,813
The day l got back.

452
00:24:56,856 --> 00:24:58,949
Describe the restrictions.

453
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:02,086
Access restricted
to level-1 security clearance.

454
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:04,221
l am level-1.

455
00:25:04,264 --> 00:25:06,960
Please enter
security verification.

456
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,904
Access denied.

457
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:09,855
Anything l can help you with,
Chief?

458
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:12,091
No, l'm just making sure
these upper pylons

459
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:13,996
are in working condition
by morning.

460
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,933
You're an inspiration
to us all.

461
00:26:21,107 --> 00:26:25,305
There were several traps laid
into the computer subroutine.

462
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:27,108
No doubt to let someone know

463
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:29,706
if l'd penetrated
their security lockout.

464
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:31,512
l wasn't fooled for a minute

465
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:34,918
and released the protected
files without any problem.

466
00:26:49,702 --> 00:26:51,465
What l found
in those hidden logs

467
00:26:51,504 --> 00:26:53,028
didn't answer all my questions

468
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:56,040
but it sure as hell confirmed
what l'd been afraid of.

469
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:58,373
They were analyzing
and reanalyzing

470
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:01,039
everything l had put
into my report

471
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,707
about Paradan security.

472
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:04,979
They'd even broken
into my personal logs

473
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:07,712
to see what they could find
in there.

474
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:11,383
l hoped they enjoyed reading
the sexy letters to my wife.

475
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:13,392
There were several entries
by Sisko

476
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:15,724
about secured messages
from the Parada system

477
00:27:15,762 --> 00:27:18,856
but no indication
what those messages were about.

478
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:21,958
Maybe they were afraid
l'd get into their files

479
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:23,992
even with a security lockout.

480
00:27:24,103 --> 00:27:26,071
Smart people.

481
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,747
Chief.

482
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:40,753
Odo, we've got a problem.

483
00:27:40,787 --> 00:27:42,755
l have to talk to you.

484
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:45,485
Hmm, it's good to see you, too.

485
00:27:48,328 --> 00:27:50,694
Aside from Jake,
not one of them was...

486
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,992
l don't know, real.

487
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:55,523
l'm not sure who we can trust
in the station at this point.

488
00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:57,695
Do any of them know
you're suspicious?

489
00:27:57,737 --> 00:27:59,364
Probably.
l've asked a few questions

490
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:02,397
been a few places
that might have tipped them off.

491
00:28:02,442 --> 00:28:04,637
They'll be keeping
close tabs on me.

492
00:28:04,677 --> 00:28:07,407
l'd call Starfleet,
but what do l tell them?

493
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:09,108
My wife doesn't seem
like my wife?

494
00:28:09,148 --> 00:28:11,139
Sisko's been making
security arrangements

495
00:28:11,184 --> 00:28:12,310
without consulting me?

496
00:28:12,352 --> 00:28:14,115
They might even call
Commander Sisko

497
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:15,964
and start asking
questions about you.

498
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:17,359
Well, that's
what l was afraid of.

499
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:18,593
And when are the Paradas due?

500
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:19,725
38 hours.

501
00:28:19,768 --> 00:28:22,737
Hmm. l don't want them coming
anywhere near this place

502
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:24,398
until we get this cleared up.

503
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,838
Agreed.

504
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:27,273
Go on about your business.

505
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:29,503
Don't do anything
to get their attention.

506
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:32,172
ln the meantime,
l'll do some investigating.

507
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,181
lf l can confirm your suspicions

508
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:37,412
we can go to Starfleet
and the Bajoran authorities

509
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:38,510
at the same time.

510
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:40,453
l'm glad you're back, Odo.

511
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:43,685
We'll get to the bottom of this.

512
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:50,857
l felt better
than l had for a long time.

513
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:52,799
l finally had an ally.

514
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:55,325
Now all l had to do was wait.

515
00:28:57,172 --> 00:28:59,663
l like to think
l'm a man with many talents

516
00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:01,504
but waiting isn't one of them.

517
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,238
l had to cover my bets--

518
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:05,769
prepare myself for whatever
might happen next.

519
00:29:05,814 --> 00:29:08,612
l still had a few tricks
up my sleeve.

520
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,667
The odds are against you,
O'Brien.

521
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,936
Against me?

522
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:36,806
What are you talking about?

523
00:29:36,845 --> 00:29:38,472
You know what l'm talking about.

524
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:39,639
You look tired.

525
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:41,171
Have you been getting
enough sleep?

526
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:43,343
What are you talking
about, Quark?!

527
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:46,911
Racquetball, the rematch
with Bashir next week.

528
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:50,049
We never finished
the first one, remember?

529
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:52,719
My, we are jumpy, aren't we?

530
00:29:54,996 --> 00:29:56,258
Change the subject.

531
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:59,232
Fine, we'll change the subject.

532
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:00,962
So, uh...

533
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:04,163
tell me about the Paradas.

534
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:05,968
They're going to be
here when-- tomorrow?

535
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:08,237
Why do you want to know
anything about the Paradas?

536
00:30:08,276 --> 00:30:11,473
lt's always good business
to know about new customers

537
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:13,344
before they walk in your door.

538
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:16,817
Oh, and which Rule
of Acquisition is that?

539
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:23,322
Oh, one of the high numbers,
194, l think.

540
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:26,384
Well, you'll have to find
out about the Paradas

541
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:28,088
from someone else.

542
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:30,097
Odo to O'Brien.

543
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:31,530
Go ahead.

544
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:33,363
Can l see you in my office?

545
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:34,732
On my way.

546
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:45,412
l see what you mean.

547
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:47,346
What did you find out?

548
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:48,974
Sit down.

549
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:52,418
How much do you know
about the Paradan rebels?

550
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:55,889
Oh, don't ask me to explain
the politics of the situation

551
00:30:55,924 --> 00:30:59,223
but l know they've been
fighting the government forces

552
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,160
for 12 years. Why?

553
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:04,393
l'm just trying to understand
the players involved here.

554
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:07,697
Odo, Sisko's logs indicate
that secret messages

555
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:10,533
have been coming
from the Parada system.

556
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:13,700
Could those messages have been
from the rebels?

557
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:15,641
As a matter of fact, they were.

558
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:17,975
That's already a breach
of the security agreement

559
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,206
we signed
with the Paradan government.

560
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:23,217
And it's a good enough reason
to cancel these peace talks.

561
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:25,845
That still might be premature.

562
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:28,151
What are you talking about?

563
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:30,680
We've got more than enough...

564
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:34,557
They got to you.

565
00:31:34,596 --> 00:31:35,824
Don't be ridiculous.

566
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:37,763
l'm just trying...

567
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,733
No, they did, they got to you.

568
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,394
All right, let's have
a little talk.

569
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:42,733
Who the hell are you?

570
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,567
We don't want to hurt you.

571
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:47,040
Here, this will help you relax.

572
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:09,189
Computer, lock onto my combadge.

573
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,961
lnitiate emergency transport
to Runabout <i>Rio Grande.</i>

574
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:15,126
Unable to complete request.

575
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:18,900
Please contact Station Commander
for assistance.

576
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:40,219
Making it tough for me, huh?

577
00:32:40,261 --> 00:32:42,354
Fine.

578
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:46,561
You want force fields,
l'll give you force fields.

579
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:50,363
There.

580
00:32:50,405 --> 00:32:52,703
Now you want to get me?

581
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,300
You'll have to release them all.

582
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,338
Ha. Thank you.

583
00:33:13,027 --> 00:33:14,654
Jake! You okay?

584
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:15,788
Yeah.

585
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,161
Good.

586
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:18,495
Listen to me.

587
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:21,263
Something isn't normal
around here.

588
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:24,203
Your dad, the others--

589
00:33:24,238 --> 00:33:25,500
something's happened to them.

590
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,873
You and l are the only ones
who can help.

591
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,241
Jake Sisko to Security.

592
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:33,509
He's here.
Level H-2, Section Five.

593
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:34,708
lt will be okay.

594
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:36,580
Just surrender to them,
and you'll be fine.

595
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:01,237
l'll search all habitat range...

596
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:02,435
You two...

597
00:34:02,477 --> 00:34:03,637
Spread out.

598
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:05,236
Check all quarters.

599
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,270
Advise people to stay
where they are

600
00:34:07,315 --> 00:34:08,714
and not to let anyone in.

601
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,739
Yes, sir.

602
00:35:41,997 --> 00:35:43,931
Shut down your engines.

603
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:45,466
Sorry, Commander.

604
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,933
l have no intention
of doing that.

605
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:48,593
You will not be
allowed to leave.

606
00:35:48,637 --> 00:35:49,695
l repeat.

607
00:35:49,738 --> 00:35:50,932
Shut down your engines now.

608
00:35:50,972 --> 00:35:52,496
lf you check your systems

609
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:55,942
you'll find that the mooring
clamps are already unlocked

610
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,844
and your tractor beams
are off-line.

611
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,246
O'Brien out.

612
00:36:03,185 --> 00:36:05,085
Shields up.

613
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,089
Are the shields holding,
computer?

614
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,496
Shields at 7 1 percent.

615
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:20,262
Warning, shields at 49 percent.

616
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:23,897
Transfer emergency life support
power to shield generators.

617
00:36:23,939 --> 00:36:25,804
Transfer complete.

618
00:36:25,841 --> 00:36:27,103
Shield status.

619
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:29,133
Shields at 93 percent.

620
00:36:31,346 --> 00:36:35,282
Full impulse,
heading 41 mark 330.

621
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:37,785
Confirmed.

622
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:42,256
Computer, open a subspace
channel to Starbase 401.

623
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,781
Priority one, Admiral Rollman.

624
00:36:44,826 --> 00:36:46,088
Stand by.

625
00:36:46,128 --> 00:36:48,688
Admiral, Miles O'Brien

626
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,755
Chief of Operations,
Deep Space 9.

627
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:52,824
l know who you are.

628
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:54,631
Admiral, l must apprise you

629
00:36:54,669 --> 00:36:56,899
of an emergency situation
on the station.

630
00:36:56,938 --> 00:36:59,668
There's been some sort
of takeover, a conspiracy.

631
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:03,166
l believe it has something to do
with the Paradan peace talks.

632
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:05,577
Listen to me very carefully.

633
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:08,208
Return to DS9 immediately.

634
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,774
Admiral, you don't understand.

635
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:13,254
l believe Commander Sisko
and all of the senior officers

636
00:37:13,288 --> 00:37:16,416
have fallen under
the influence of something...

637
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:18,722
Turn the ship around
and go back.

638
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,455
You will not be harmed.

639
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:27,199
lt seemed almost
unbelievable to me.

640
00:37:27,235 --> 00:37:30,204
Had someone or something
started to infiltrate

641
00:37:30,238 --> 00:37:31,364
all of Starfleet?

642
00:37:31,406 --> 00:37:37,743
Computer, new heading.
180 mark 31, to the wormhole.

643
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:09,936
Coffee, Jamaican blend,
double strong, double sweet.

644
00:38:12,314 --> 00:38:14,373
Time to Paradas system,
computer.

645
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:16,884
One minute, 20 seconds.

646
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:19,614
How much lead time
do we have on the <i>Mekong?</i>

647
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:22,589
At current speeds,
seven minutes, four seconds.

648
00:38:22,624 --> 00:38:25,855
That will disappear in a hurry
once we drop out of warp.

649
00:38:25,894 --> 00:38:29,887
Ah, at least, l get to choose
where they catch up.

650
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:33,560
Computer, identify the largest
planet in the Parada system.

651
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,899
Parada lV.

652
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:38,167
Adjust course
to approach Parada lV.

653
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:39,264
Confirmed.

654
00:38:40,775 --> 00:38:42,902
How many moons
around Parada lV?

655
00:38:42,978 --> 00:38:44,843
Seven.

656
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:47,643
Hmm, lucky seven.

657
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:48,910
Display coordinates.

658
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:50,884
Approaching the Parada system.

659
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:52,614
Drop to impulse.

660
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:04,264
Status of <i>Mekong.</i>

661
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:05,857
<i>Mekong</i> has dropped out of warp

662
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:08,333
and has adjusted course
to identical heading.

663
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,962
Perfect.

664
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:12,269
How much time
have they made up on us?

665
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:14,002
At current speed, the <i>Mekong</i>

666
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,840
is two minutes, one second
behind this vessel.

667
00:39:16,878 --> 00:39:21,508
Adjust speed to let them catch
up to us in 30 seconds.

668
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:23,847
Dropping to point-four impulse.

669
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:28,618
Come on, l'm waiting for you.

670
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:36,559
Warning.

671
00:39:36,598 --> 00:39:38,088
Entering polar-magnetic field.

672
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:41,330
Sensors will be nonfunctional
for 27 seconds.

673
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:44,532
Switch to manual navigation.

674
00:39:44,572 --> 00:39:46,062
Switching.

675
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:52,076
Computer, full impulse.
Engage.

676
00:39:52,113 --> 00:39:54,775
Confirmed.
Manual navigation in effect.

677
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:04,417
Shut down all engines,
all main power systems.

678
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:06,393
Maintain silent running status.

679
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:07,918
Confirmed.

680
00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:13,467
Yeah, where did l go?

681
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:16,402
Now you see me, now you don't.

682
00:40:16,438 --> 00:40:18,303
What's it going to be, fellas?

683
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,241
l can play hide-and-seek
with the best of them.

684
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:25,946
Hmm, no time for games, huh?

685
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:29,040
Computer, identify
<i>Mekong's</i> new heading.

686
00:40:29,084 --> 00:40:31,518
41 mark 201.

687
00:40:31,553 --> 00:40:32,850
Probable destination?

688
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:35,151
Parada ll.

689
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,488
Parada ll...
what's on Parada ll?

690
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:39,152
Specify parameters.

691
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:41,560
Computer, monitor
all transporter activity

692
00:40:41,596 --> 00:40:43,655
to and from the <i>Mekong.</i>

693
00:40:43,698 --> 00:40:45,825
The <i>Mekong</i> transporter
has been energized.

694
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:47,357
What?
They beamed to the surface?

695
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:48,664
Confirmed.

696
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:49,829
How many people?

697
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:50,929
Three people.

698
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:52,234
Anyone left on board?

699
00:40:52,273 --> 00:40:53,433
Negative.

700
00:40:53,475 --> 00:40:55,238
Put us on a course
for Parada ll.

701
00:40:55,276 --> 00:40:56,971
Take us into synchronous orbit

702
00:40:57,011 --> 00:40:59,002
above their location
on the surface.

703
00:41:27,342 --> 00:41:29,207
Having a little
unscheduled negotiation

704
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:30,438
with the rebels, are we?

705
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:31,843
You don't understand.

706
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,348
Put down your weapons,
and we'll explain.

707
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:35,644
No.

708
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:37,947
l've got a better idea.

709
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:40,180
You put down yours first.

710
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:45,053
Do it!

711
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,232
You, too!

712
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:56,931
Everything you need
to understand

713
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:58,268
is behind this door.

714
00:41:58,306 --> 00:42:01,605
Yeah, like a squadron of rebels
maybe, huh?

715
00:42:01,643 --> 00:42:02,735
No.

716
00:42:02,777 --> 00:42:04,241
lf you just permit me.

717
00:42:04,374 --> 00:42:05,466
Just stay where you are.

718
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:06,771
Listen to him.

719
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,744
He's not your enemy.
We're not your enemy.

720
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:10,747
No?

721
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:13,045
Please, this will
explain everything.

722
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:14,744
l don't want to hurt you.

723
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:19,582
Doctor, we need you!

724
00:42:42,612 --> 00:42:44,375
He's perfect.

725
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:46,780
He looks just like me.

726
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,217
Apparently,
he thought he was you.

727
00:42:49,252 --> 00:42:50,583
No doubt they thought

728
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,747
that would make him
more convincing.

729
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:55,087
We believe there
was some triggering device

730
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,422
programmed into him

731
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,724
that would take over
during the peace talks.

732
00:42:58,762 --> 00:43:02,095
The government scientists
have learned how to do

733
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:03,861
remarkable things
with replicants.

734
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,868
What was he programmed to do?

735
00:43:05,902 --> 00:43:07,199
We're not entirely sure.

736
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:09,899
Assassinate someone
at the peace talks, we think.

737
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:11,736
Perhaps our entire delegation.

738
00:43:11,775 --> 00:43:12,901
They were tipped off

739
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:14,874
by one of the informants
in their government.

740
00:43:14,911 --> 00:43:16,674
There was a rumor
that you'd been abducted

741
00:43:16,713 --> 00:43:19,181
and replaced by a replicant.

742
00:43:19,216 --> 00:43:21,411
We've had people looking
for you ever since.

743
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:23,851
There was no way
to prove he wasn't you.

744
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:26,117
He passed a physical exam
with flying colors.

745
00:43:26,156 --> 00:43:28,454
And he sure knew his way
around the station.

746
00:43:28,492 --> 00:43:30,790
l had more wires
attached to my head

747
00:43:30,827 --> 00:43:32,624
than you could count.

748
00:43:32,662 --> 00:43:33,924
Now l know why.

749
00:43:33,964 --> 00:43:36,626
We were trying to shut him out
of every sensitive security area

750
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:38,133
while they were searching
for you.

751
00:43:38,168 --> 00:43:39,294
He must have wondered

752
00:43:39,336 --> 00:43:40,928
what the hell was going on
with all of us.

753
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:42,664
By the time we'd learned
of your rescue

754
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:45,140
he'd already gotten away from us
and was on his way here.

755
00:43:45,175 --> 00:43:47,939
l wonder why he was coming back.

756
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:50,774
lf it were me,
l'd be trying to warn somebody

757
00:43:50,814 --> 00:43:53,339
there was something
wrong at the station.

758
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:58,946
Maybe in a strange sort of way,
he was trying to be a hero.

759
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:04,618
Keiko...

760
00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:11,164
What about her?

761
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:14,266
Tell her...

762
00:44:14,304 --> 00:44:16,238
l love...
