1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,871
Dabo!

2
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:19,103
Quark!

3
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,270
Oh... not now, Odo.

4
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,643
We have to talk.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,647
lt'll have to wait.

6
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,648
lt can't wait.

7
00:00:23,682 --> 00:00:25,616
Of course not.

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:26,618
Make it fast.

9
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,483
l have business to attend to.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,852
You remember
that Subytt freighter

11
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:32,117
we were discussing
the other day--

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,625
the one you claimed
was smuggling

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,855
defective isolinear rods
to Bajor?

14
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:38,192
Yes, yes.
What about it?

15
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:39,195
Well, l conducted

16
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:41,493
a little investigation
of that freighter

17
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:44,195
and do you know
what l discovered?

18
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:48,172
That l was telling the truth.

19
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,199
That's right.

20
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:55,075
l arrested the First Officer
and two of the crew.

21
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:56,478
Congratulations, Constable.

22
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,709
l knew you could do it.

23
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:01,150
Now, if you don't mind,
l am needed upstairs.

24
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,653
Hold on.

25
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,088
l'm not finished with you.

26
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:06,852
Oh, really, Odo?

27
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:08,655
Sometimes l think
there's no pleasing you.

28
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,424
l help you crack
a notorious smuggling ring

29
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:15,024
and yet you still insist on
treating me like the enemy?

30
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:17,092
You are the enemy.

31
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:20,502
Then how do you explain
my helping you?

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,171
That's just it.

33
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,938
l can't explain it.

34
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:27,740
lt's simple, really.

35
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:30,748
l figured we've been at each
others' throats long enough.

36
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:32,750
lt's time we called a truce.

37
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:33,944
Truce?

38
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:35,509
You must be joking.

39
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,819
Ask the Subytt First Officer
if l'm joking.

40
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:40,848
From now on, you and l
are going to be friends.

41
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,694
You're up to something.

42
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,197
Why would you say that?

43
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,699
Because you're always
up to something.

44
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,703
l can see this is
going to take time

45
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,706
but eventually you'll
learn to trust me.

46
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,571
Hmm, hmm.

47
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:58,371
That'll be the day.

48
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:09,653
l don't think l can remember

49
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:12,748
Odo ever looking so...
perplexed.

50
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,258
He's not alone.

51
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:15,759
Those Subytt smugglers

52
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:18,422
were a potential source
of great profit.

53
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:21,660
Must l quote you
the 7 6th Rule of Acquisition?

54
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,997
The 7 6th...

55
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:26,003
''Every once in a while,
declare peace.

56
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:29,268
lt confuses the hell
out of your enemies.''

57
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:45,053
Hi, Quark.

58
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,558
How are your lobes?

59
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:52,563
Tingling at the sight of you.

60
00:02:52,597 --> 00:02:55,191
What'll it be, hmm?

61
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,201
Another black hole?

62
00:02:57,235 --> 00:02:59,203
No, l don't have time.

63
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:01,205
My ship's about to pull out.

64
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,139
Do you know of anyone
going to Bajor?

65
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:05,939
Ships go back and forth
from there all the time.

66
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,274
Why?

67
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:11,339
l promised someone
l'd deliver this for them.

68
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:13,851
Doesn't look like l'm going
to get there this trip.

69
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:16,285
lt's an earring.

70
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,652
l know it's an earring.

71
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:20,055
lt was given to me
by a maintenance worker

72
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:21,456
on Cardassia lV.

73
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:25,759
Are you saying a Cardassian
gave you a Bajoran earring?

74
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:28,163
He asked me to take it to Bajor.

75
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,464
Said whoever l showed
it to would understand.

76
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,333
He said that?

77
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,338
Well, this is a Bajoran
station, isn't it?

78
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:35,339
Mm-hmm.

79
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:38,900
Well, there must be someone here

80
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:40,741
who would know
what to do with it.

81
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:42,178
Oh, there is.

82
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:43,646
Who?

83
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:48,209
Me.

84
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:16,039
Come in.

85
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,809
Surprise.

86
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:21,250
What do you want?

87
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:23,550
l always wondered what
your quarters looked like.

88
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:25,556
That better not be
your only reason for being here.

89
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,558
You don't entertain much,
do you?

90
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:28,923
Oh, l entertain a lot--

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,359
l just don't entertain you.

92
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,693
Let me guess.

93
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,562
The bedroom.

94
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:36,430
You take one step in here

95
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:38,561
and l promise you,
it'll be your last.

96
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:40,730
lt could be worth it.

97
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:42,740
You've got five seconds
to tell me what you want.

98
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:44,605
Aren't you going
to offer me a beverage?

99
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:46,406
Five... four...

100
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:48,071
Can we at least sit down?

101
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:51,048
Three, two, one.

102
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,379
Wait!

103
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,386
l brought you something.

104
00:04:57,856 --> 00:04:59,414
Where did you get that?

105
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:00,788
ls it valuable?

106
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,588
l said where did you get it?

107
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:04,424
From a Boslic Freighter Captain.

108
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:06,396
She got it from a Cardassian.

109
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
Where?

110
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:08,966
On Cardassia lV.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,831
That's what she told me, anyway.

112
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:19,667
Consider it a gift!

113
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:22,285
Hey, Dad, wait up.

114
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:25,265
You got a minute?

115
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:26,766
For you, absolutely.

116
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:28,268
l've got some great news.

117
00:07:28,302 --> 00:07:29,769
You passed your algebra test.

118
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:30,793
Better than that.

119
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:32,806
You learned how to hit
Bob Gibson's fastball.

120
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,807
No, even better.

121
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:35,468
Better than hitting
Gibson's fastball?

122
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:36,601
This l want to hear.

123
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:38,236
You remember that Bajoran
girl l told you about?

124
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,371
The one
with the beautiful smile?

125
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:41,313
That's right-- Laira.

126
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,407
l decided to ask her out.

127
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,417
Well, good for you.

128
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:45,043
And now you've come
to the old man

129
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:46,678
for advice
on what to say to her.

130
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:47,779
Dad, l al...

131
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:49,653
The main thing is you can't
be afraid of rejection.

132
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,920
Dad, l already asked her
out, and she said yes.

133
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,620
She did?
That's wonderful.

134
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:54,628
l was just wondering

135
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:56,391
if you had any ideas
on what we could do.

136
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,694
l was thinking of taking her
to the holosuites.

137
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,758
The holosuites?
l don't think so.

138
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:01,961
Why not?

139
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:03,060
Because you're too young

140
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:04,537
to take a girl
to the holosuites.

141
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:06,972
Okay, then how about if l
take her to our quarters?

142
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:08,235
Oh, no, no.

143
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:09,242
No quarters.

144
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:10,743
We're just going to talk.

145
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:12,075
Talk in public.

146
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:13,842
lt's not the same.

147
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:15,280
You want to talk?

148
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:16,681
Take her upstairs.

149
00:08:16,717 --> 00:08:18,082
And that way you can talk

150
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:20,779
and watch the ships
go through the wormhole.

151
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:21,810
That's boring.

152
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:22,845
Since when?

153
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,289
Since l started
going out with girls.

154
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:26,293
This is your first date.

155
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:28,591
And l don't want it
to be my last.

156
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,256
Commander,
l need to speak with you.

157
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:31,559
One moment, Major.

158
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,262
l can see you're not ready
to have this conversation yet.

159
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:36,769
l'm not ready?

160
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:39,238
l'll just have to come up
with a few ideas on my own.

161
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:40,934
Really, don't worry about it.

162
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:43,102
Who's worried?

163
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:44,371
Commander?

164
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:47,437
Join me, Major.

165
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,017
One <i>raktajino</i>
with a <i>jacarine</i> peel.

166
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:58,957
Nothing for me.

167
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,059
One icoberry torte.

168
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:15,469
So... Major

169
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:17,477
what can l do for you?

170
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,069
l need to borrow a runabout.

171
00:09:19,113 --> 00:09:20,102
For what?

172
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:23,310
You really don't want
to ask me that.

173
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,317
lt's too late.

174
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:25,682
l already asked.

175
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:27,687
You don't want
to know the answer.

176
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:30,189
Major, l can't loan you
a Starfleet runabout

177
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:32,215
without knowing
where you plan on taking it.

178
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:39,131
To Cardassia lV to rescue
a Bajoran prisoner of war.

179
00:09:42,102 --> 00:09:44,297
You're right.

180
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:45,737
l wish you hadn't told me.

181
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:48,765
This earring was recently
smuggled off the planet.

182
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:50,276
Do you see this?

183
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:53,371
That is the insignia
of Li Nalas.

184
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:55,109
The resistance leader?

185
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:56,309
The greatest we ever had.

186
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,113
His victory over Gul Zarale
in hand-to-hand combat...

187
00:09:58,219 --> 00:09:59,550
Major, l have already
heard the story.

188
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:01,817
Wasn't he reported
killed in action?

189
00:10:01,856 --> 00:10:03,551
His body was never found.

190
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:06,116
Look, Commander,
l wouldn't be asking you this

191
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:08,991
if l thought there was
any other way to rescue Li.

192
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:11,657
But Bajoran ships just don't
have the maneuverability

193
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:13,132
or the defensive capabilities

194
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:16,466
to get me safely in and out
of Cardassian territory.

195
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,367
You're sure this is genuine?

196
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:23,501
Dax found dermal residue
on the backing.

197
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:26,138
A genetic analysis matched
it to Li's DNA records.

198
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:27,475
lt's genuine all right.

199
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:30,416
Have you told
the provisional government?

200
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:33,147
l contacted three ministers.

201
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:36,486
Their response was
exactly what l expected.

202
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:39,152
ln other words,
they're unwilling

203
00:10:39,193 --> 00:10:43,459
to risk going to war
with Cardassia over an earring.

204
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,863
l can't say l blame them.

205
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:51,804
Commander, you and l both know
the provisional government

206
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,171
is made up
of political opportunists

207
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:56,175
too busy
fighting amongst themselves

208
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,337
to care what happens to Bajor.

209
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,472
Since the loss of the Kai

210
00:11:00,514 --> 00:11:02,311
the situation has only
gone from bad to worse.

211
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:04,283
There are reports
of factional fighting

212
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:05,649
in half a dozen districts.

213
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:08,587
Religious riots have spread
throughout the southern islands.

214
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:10,385
Bajor needs a leader--

215
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:12,221
someone the people
will listen to

216
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:13,590
someone they can trust.

217
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:16,721
And you think that Li Nalas
is that leader?

218
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,493
l know he is.

219
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:20,124
O'Brien to Sisko.

220
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,566
Go ahead, Chief.

221
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:25,265
l think you and Odo had better
join me in the Habitat Ring

222
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:26,705
level 13, section 4.

223
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,935
There's something
you should see.

224
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:30,534
We'll be right there.

225
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:34,370
Do l get the runabout?

226
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:38,843
l'll have to think it over.

227
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,154
l was on my way
to Crossover Bridge 3

228
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:47,319
to do some repair work
on the field modulators

229
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:48,794
when l noticed this.

230
00:11:51,498 --> 00:11:54,592
This is the emblem of the
Alliance for Global Unity.

231
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:55,932
They call themselves the Circle.

232
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,029
The Circle, huh?

233
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:00,404
What gives them the right
to mess up our station?

234
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:01,908
They're an extremist faction

235
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:05,742
who believe in Bajor
for the Bajorans.

236
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:07,076
All other species are inferior

237
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:08,843
and should be expelled
from the planet.

238
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:11,282
l understand this emblem
has appeared all over Bajor.

239
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:12,342
That's correct

240
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:14,786
but this is the first
time l've seen it here.

241
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:16,119
l want to be informed
immediately

242
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:19,124
if this emblem appears
anyplace else on the station.

243
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:20,488
Understood.

244
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:22,051
lf they think scrawling
a few signs

245
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:23,256
is going to get rid of us

246
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:25,390
they've got
another thing coming.

247
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:26,922
Right now, they're just
trying to show us

248
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,025
that we're vulnerable.

249
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:29,695
l wouldn't be overly
concerned, Commander.

250
00:12:29,737 --> 00:12:31,864
This section is
a low-security area.

251
00:12:31,905 --> 00:12:33,133
As of now, Constable

252
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:36,438
there are no low-security areas
on this station.

253
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,289
You wanted to see me, Benjamin?

254
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:53,699
Ah, yes.

255
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:55,101
Have a seat.

256
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,730
Am l to assume this is
going to be about baseball?

257
00:12:57,773 --> 00:12:59,035
Not this time.

258
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:00,473
Good.

259
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:02,477
l thought you enjoyed
talking about baseball.

260
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:04,445
Curzon enjoyed it

261
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,779
but not half as much
as he led you to believe.

262
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:10,182
So what's on your mind,
Benjamin?

263
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:13,052
l've been thinking
about our mission here.

264
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:15,146
l look at the turmoil on Bajor

265
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,590
and l see everything
we fought for this past year

266
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:19,059
starting to unravel.

267
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:20,958
l told you this was going
to be a tough assignment

268
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:22,224
when we came here.

269
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:25,461
Of course, l didn't realize
it was going to be this tough.

270
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,992
What if l told you
that l knew someone

271
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:30,335
who could bring stability
to Bajor?

272
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,363
Someone who could
unite the factions

273
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:34,376
and give us a chance
to do our job?

274
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,901
l'd say give Kira the runabout.

275
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:40,711
How do you know
about Kira wanting a runabout?

276
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:44,014
l promise not to tell.

277
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:45,384
All right.

278
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:48,515
Supposing l do help
and she does rescue Li Nalas.

279
00:13:48,557 --> 00:13:50,525
What do we say
to the Cardassians?

280
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,049
The question is

281
00:13:52,094 --> 00:13:53,959
what do they say to us?

282
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:56,965
They swore they released
all their Bajoran prisoners.

283
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,315
Chief...

284
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,294
Major Kira needs a runabout.

285
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:29,297
Oh, so she's going
to Cardassia lV after all.

286
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:32,061
ls there anyone on this station
she didn't tell?

287
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:35,035
l doubt
she mentioned it to Quark.

288
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,868
Well, then,
as far as Quark's concerned

289
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:39,635
she's going to Lamenda Prime

290
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,040
to bring back mineral samples.

291
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:42,065
l see.

292
00:14:42,177 --> 00:14:43,508
Now, is there any way
we can prevent

293
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:44,910
the Cardassian sensors

294
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:46,744
from picking up
the runabout's signature?

295
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:48,841
l could modulate
the engine's power emissions

296
00:14:48,884 --> 00:14:51,182
reconfigure
the deflector shield grid

297
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,380
and install field buffers

298
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:53,979
around the subspace
emitter coil.

299
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,082
By the time l'm done,
the Cardassians will think

300
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,888
they're picking up
a Lissepian transport.

301
00:14:57,926 --> 00:14:58,984
Yeah?

302
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:02,987
l see you've already given this
a bit of thought.

303
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,556
l suppose l have.

304
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:15,036
Come in.

305
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:20,444
Commander... Chief.

306
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:22,040
l was just getting ready
to leave.

307
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:23,574
l just stopped by
to wish you luck.

308
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:27,283
And...

309
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:30,223
to tell you that Chief O'Brien

310
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:33,319
will be accompanying you
on your mission.

311
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:37,464
l don't think
that's a good idea.

312
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:40,059
Having a Federation officer
along

313
00:15:40,102 --> 00:15:42,002
could cause complications
for you later.

314
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:43,902
l'm willing to risk that.

315
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,066
You're an excellent
pilot, Major

316
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:48,575
but Mr. O'Brien here
is better.

317
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,305
And l want to make sure

318
00:15:50,345 --> 00:15:54,543
that l get my runabout
back in one piece.

319
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:58,417
l appreciate the offer,
but this is a Bajoran problem.

320
00:15:58,454 --> 00:16:00,319
l don't agree.

321
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:04,485
The truth is, l need
Li Nalas back on Bajor

322
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:06,016
as much as you do.

323
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:07,392
Besides

324
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:10,193
l've seen how the Cardassians
treat their prisoners.

325
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:12,564
No one should have
to suffer like that.

326
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:14,865
lf the Cardassians
get their hands on us

327
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:16,029
we'll be the ones suffering.

328
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:19,266
They'll have to catch us first.

329
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:28,211
l suppose l could
use the company.

330
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:35,051
You've got the controls, Chief.

331
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:36,250
Right.

332
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:40,995
Before we go

333
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:44,055
there's, uh, one thing we need
to clear up between us.

334
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,259
What's that?

335
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,063
This mission can end
only one of two ways--

336
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:50,594
either we bring back Li Nalas,
or we don't come back at all.

337
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,901
Understood.

338
00:16:54,743 --> 00:16:57,735
Then take us out of here,
Mr. O'Brien.

339
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,340
lnitializing launch sequence.

340
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,465
How much longer
till we reach Cardassia lV?

341
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:24,301
l estimate another 30 minutes.

342
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:27,275
Hold on.

343
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:29,174
We're being scanned.

344
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:30,644
Can you get a fix on the source?

345
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:37,048
lts position is holding steady
at bearing 219 mark 23.

346
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:39,416
lt must be
a navigational control post.

347
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:41,422
lt's probably
just a routine scan.

348
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:44,049
We're being hailed.

349
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:46,719
Then again,
we could be in serious trouble.

350
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:48,229
They're repeating the hail.

351
00:17:48,263 --> 00:17:50,731
We're on the edge
of their scanner range.

352
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:53,667
That puts us out
of visual contact.

353
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:56,637
l say we try and bluff them.

354
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:00,701
Opening a channel.

355
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:05,236
This is Cardassian Navigational
Control Post 24.

356
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,713
ldentify yourself.

357
00:18:06,748 --> 00:18:09,717
This is the Lissepian
Transport <i>Martuk.</i>

358
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:11,218
According to our scan

359
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:15,622
your subspace field emitters
appear to be malfunctioning.

360
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:19,616
The field buffers must be
distorting our power signature.

361
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:23,597
Uh, we're... having problems
with our phase modulators.

362
00:18:23,632 --> 00:18:26,032
We're attempting
to correct the problem.

363
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:27,601
Do you require assistance?

364
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:30,799
We can dispatch a repair ship.

365
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,740
They want to help us?

366
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:39,577
Your offer is most appreciated,
Post 24, but unnecessary.

367
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:40,912
Are you certain?

368
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:43,577
Your power signature
is still fluctuating.

369
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:45,519
He's getting suspicious.

370
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:53,061
l believe we can correct
the problem on our own.

371
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:56,690
Besides, Gul Marayn is waiting

372
00:18:56,732 --> 00:18:59,667
on Cardassia lV to receive
my shipment of <i>rulot</i> seeds.

373
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:02,169
Any delay could ruin
the entire crop

374
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:05,230
not to mention the Gul's mood.

375
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:06,741
Understood.

376
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:09,835
You can put in for repairs
after you deliver your cargo.

377
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:12,210
My plan, exactly.

378
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:18,442
He's cut off their transmission.

379
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,148
Tell me, Major...

380
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:25,625
who is this Gul Marayn?

381
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:27,253
Don't ask me.

382
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:29,230
l just made him up.

383
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:40,378
We're in synchronous orbit
above the Hutet labor camp.

384
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:43,220
l've limited the bio-scans

385
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:45,746
to detect
only Bajoran life-forms.

386
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,251
Hold on.

387
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:52,889
We're getting multiple readings.

388
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:55,422
There must be about a dozen
Bajoran prisoners down there.

389
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:56,695
What?!

390
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:02,332
ls there any way of beaming up
more than two at a time?

391
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:04,035
l'm afraid not.

392
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:05,634
As soon as we beam
the first two up

393
00:20:05,677 --> 00:20:07,838
all hell is going
to break loose in that camp.

394
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,643
There's no way of guaranteeing

395
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:12,809
that Li will be
one of the first two.

396
00:20:12,851 --> 00:20:15,183
What's security like down there?

397
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,687
The compound is surrounded

398
00:20:16,722 --> 00:20:18,952
by a standard
Cardassian force field.

399
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:21,989
We're going to have to land.

400
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:24,587
lt's our only chance of getting
them all out of there.

401
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:27,257
l'll find us a secluded
place to put down.

402
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:36,936
Back to work!

403
00:20:56,795 --> 00:20:58,729
Do as l say!

404
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:06,470
How do l look?

405
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,473
l doubt there's
a Cardassian alive

406
00:21:08,507 --> 00:21:09,974
who could resist you.

407
00:21:10,008 --> 00:21:11,475
l hope you're right.

408
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,171
So do l.

409
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:16,071
Stop talking!

410
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:20,051
Halt!

411
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:22,382
We want to see the Prefect.

412
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:23,888
What for?

413
00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:27,551
She has an appointment with him.

414
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:31,221
l used to be stationed on Bajor.

415
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:32,992
Then you know why the Prefect

416
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:35,329
doesn't want
to be kept waiting, huh?

417
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:38,063
What's this all about?

418
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,229
l'm not quite sure.

419
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:42,536
What would it cost me
for an appointment?

420
00:21:42,574 --> 00:21:44,201
More than you could afford.

421
00:21:44,242 --> 00:21:46,335
Two strips
of gold-pressed latinum--

422
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:48,005
she's all yours.

423
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:49,343
He wouldn't know
what to do with me.

424
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:51,008
She needs disciplining.

425
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:53,017
From a boy like you? Ha!

426
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:55,815
l don't think
you're capable of it.

427
00:21:55,854 --> 00:21:56,946
Step back.

428
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:59,513
l want to examine
what l'm paying for.

429
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:00,889
Sure, sure

430
00:22:00,926 --> 00:22:05,454
but no sampling the merchandise
until the sale's complete, okay?

431
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:06,987
Come here.

432
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:21,973
Now...

433
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:23,446
show me why

434
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:27,350
you're worth two strips
of gold-pressed latinum.

435
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:30,320
All right.

436
00:22:52,077 --> 00:22:53,476
Li Nalas!

437
00:22:53,512 --> 00:22:54,979
Who are you?

438
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:56,378
Major Kira Nerys.

439
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:57,711
We've come to get you
out of here.

440
00:22:57,749 --> 00:22:59,717
The earring-- you got it?

441
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:00,809
Yes.

442
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:02,410
l don't understand.
My earring was lost.

443
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:04,854
No, l had it smuggled
back to Bajor.

444
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,188
Gentlemen, l suggest you keep
this discussion for later, okay?

445
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:08,988
Come on.

446
00:23:13,698 --> 00:23:14,892
Oh!

447
00:23:24,643 --> 00:23:28,101
Come on, we have a ship waiting.

448
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:34,914
Let's get him
behind those rocks.

449
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:41,725
l see them!

450
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:45,260
Keep down.

451
00:23:49,935 --> 00:23:52,426
We'll never make it
at this rate.

452
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:55,630
Get Li back to Bajor.

453
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:57,505
Four of us will stay behind
and hold them off

454
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:58,566
till you reach your ship.

455
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,907
No, l won't allow it.

456
00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:00,912
Don't you see?

457
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:02,504
We did this for you!

458
00:24:02,547 --> 00:24:04,447
Just get him back safely.

459
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:05,449
That's all that counts.

460
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:06,780
You have my word.

461
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:08,012
-All right, go.
-Come on.

462
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:09,384
-Go!
-Come on.

463
00:24:31,676 --> 00:24:33,109
Come on!

464
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:36,407
Ready to launch, Major.

465
00:24:36,448 --> 00:24:39,144
Not yet, some of the others
might still make it.

466
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:41,084
Standing by.

467
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:47,052
l'm picking up two Galor-class
warships entering orbit.

468
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:50,925
They should be overhead
in one minute, 45 seconds.

469
00:24:50,962 --> 00:24:54,591
Major, you can't leave
those men behind.

470
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:58,398
One minute, 30 seconds.

471
00:24:58,436 --> 00:25:01,405
lf we don't leave now, Major,
we never will.

472
00:25:03,942 --> 00:25:06,536
Take us home, Chief.

473
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:08,478
Yes, sir.

474
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:25,254
Careful, he took a phaser hit.

475
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:26,949
Easy now, l have you.

476
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:29,981
Doctor, these people have been
prisoners for ten years.

477
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:31,584
They need medical attention.

478
00:25:31,627 --> 00:25:32,594
They'll get it

479
00:25:32,628 --> 00:25:34,653
but first, l better take
a look at this wound.

480
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:35,664
Bashir to Dax.

481
00:25:35,698 --> 00:25:36,790
Go ahead, Doctor.

482
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,801
We've got a patient
who needs emergency treatment.

483
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:40,564
Beam us to the lnfirmary.

484
00:25:40,603 --> 00:25:41,695
Stand by.

485
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,574
Commander, l need to talk...

486
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:50,806
Ah, Major, l'm glad
you could join us.

487
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:54,510
l'm sorry.
l didn't know you were busy.

488
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,108
Apparently not.

489
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:57,619
l'll just wait outside.

490
00:25:57,653 --> 00:25:58,813
Hold on, Major.

491
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:01,380
There's something
l want you to hear.

492
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:02,948
Go ahead, Dukat.

493
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:07,325
Major, l have just informed
Commander Sisko

494
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:12,858
that the Cardassian High Command
has issued a formal apology

495
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:14,961
to the people of Bajor.

496
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:16,096
An apology?

497
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:19,074
We had no idea
that Bajoran prisoners

498
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:22,669
were still being held
on Cardassia lV.

499
00:26:22,712 --> 00:26:25,977
Such detentions
are a direct violation

500
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:30,475
of Supreme Directive 2645

501
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,511
and l assure you

502
00:26:32,555 --> 00:26:36,491
the camp Prefect
will be chastised accordingly.

503
00:26:36,526 --> 00:26:39,518
What about the prisoners
that were left behind?

504
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:42,998
They are already en route
to Bajor.

505
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:48,401
Well, l look forward
to their safe return.

506
00:26:48,437 --> 00:26:49,836
l'm sure you do.

507
00:26:49,872 --> 00:26:53,638
And l hope
that our quick response

508
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:58,943
to this unfortunate situation
will prove once and for all

509
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:02,178
that Cardassia
is no longer your enemy.

510
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:05,912
Commander?

511
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:07,980
l'm as surprised as you are.

512
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:11,692
There's got to be a reason

513
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:13,627
why they're being
so accommodating.

514
00:27:13,663 --> 00:27:14,687
l'm sure there is

515
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,290
but until we can figure out
their motives

516
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,459
let us just be grateful

517
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:20,935
that all the prisoners
are being returned safely.

518
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,633
Congratulations on the success
of your mission, Major.

519
00:27:31,547 --> 00:27:33,742
There, that should do it.

520
00:27:33,783 --> 00:27:35,683
How do you feel?

521
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:41,282
Better.

522
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:42,586
Good.

523
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,786
Luckily, your wound
wasn't as serious

524
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,124
as it looked.

525
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:48,187
You've probably had a lot worse.

526
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:51,200
Well, actually,
this one was bad enough.

527
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:54,169
You know, l've read
all about your battle

528
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:55,192
with Gul Zarale.

529
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:57,297
That was a long time ago.

530
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,399
Well, l consider myself
a bit of a history buff

531
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:01,000
and l must say
some of the campaigns

532
00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:03,511
you led against the Cardassians
were truly remarkable...

533
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:06,743
Doctor, l think that you'll find

534
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:09,808
that others enjoy talking
about those days

535
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:11,285
far more than l do.

536
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,754
Of course.

537
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:15,518
l understand completely.

538
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:21,655
Amazing.

539
00:28:21,697 --> 00:28:23,062
What is?

540
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:24,930
Being here.

541
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:25,934
l used to work

542
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:28,903
in one of this station's
ore processing plants.

543
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:29,962
l think you will find

544
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:32,097
that things have changed
considerably.

545
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:34,974
Commander, a transport
carrying Minister Jaro

546
00:28:35,044 --> 00:28:36,568
has just arrived from Bajor.

547
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:37,636
Major

548
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,773
l think you should
have the honor

549
00:28:39,815 --> 00:28:41,339
of welcoming him aboard.

550
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:42,373
Thank you, Commander.

551
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:46,950
lf you're hungry

552
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:50,117
the Replimat has some
passable Bajoran food.

553
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:53,552
Actually, l'm a bit tired.

554
00:28:53,596 --> 00:28:55,564
l think l'd like
to see my quarters.

555
00:28:55,598 --> 00:28:56,565
Of course.

556
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:57,759
That's Li Nalas.

557
00:29:01,637 --> 00:29:04,197
lt appears you've
been recognized.

558
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,647
Minister Jaro.

559
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:13,308
Major.

560
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:14,646
Where is he?

561
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:16,311
He's on the Promenade
with Commander Sisko.

562
00:29:16,352 --> 00:29:17,319
And he's all right?

563
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:18,945
Considering
what he's been through

564
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:20,113
in the past ten years.

565
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:24,320
Li Nalas alive--
who would have ever imagined?

566
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,760
The Prophets were kind
to you today, Major.

567
00:29:26,796 --> 00:29:29,094
l'd, uh, say they were
kind to all of us.

568
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:30,894
You know, your little adventure

569
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:33,333
made you some enemies
in the Chamber of Ministers.

570
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:34,336
l'm not surprised.

571
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,667
All l did was risk my life.

572
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:39,801
What you did today, Major
was declare war on Cardassia.

573
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:41,707
Thankfully, they declined
the invitation.

574
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:44,338
l'd do it again if it meant
bringing Li Nalas home.

575
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,404
Yes, l'm sure you would.

576
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:47,541
Although, officially,
l have to warn you

577
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:49,915
that the next time
you disobey orders

578
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,614
will mean the end
of your military career.

579
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:54,782
As a private citizen...

580
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:57,315
l want to thank you
for what you've done this day.

581
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:01,458
That's good to hear.

582
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:03,226
Now take me to see Li Nalas.

583
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,460
Move it back, please.

584
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:11,598
No pushing, no pushing.

585
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,972
l'm sorry about this, Commander.

586
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:16,637
l don't think they're
going to leave

587
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,647
until you say a few words.

588
00:30:18,681 --> 00:30:19,807
l agree.

589
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:27,820
lf that's what it takes.

590
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:35,963
lt's good to be free.

591
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:41,936
lt's good to know that...

592
00:30:41,971 --> 00:30:44,462
after all our years
of struggle...

593
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:48,207
...Bajor is finally free.

594
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:50,972
Yes, it is good to be free.

595
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:53,141
Well...

596
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:56,283
it really is you, isn't it?

597
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:57,444
Li Nalas.

598
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:59,716
l'm Minister Jaro Essa

599
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:00,744
and l can't tell you

600
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,781
how delighted l am
to welcome you home.

601
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:04,816
Believe me, it is
a pleasure to be here.

602
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,328
Would you mind if l
address the crowd?

603
00:31:07,363 --> 00:31:08,830
You can't expect a politician

604
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:10,729
to give up an opportunity
like this.

605
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:12,791
You go right ahead.

606
00:31:12,835 --> 00:31:14,166
Thank you.

607
00:31:15,938 --> 00:31:19,567
Fellow Bajorans, l have
only one thing to say to you--

608
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:21,098
to ask you, really.

609
00:31:21,143 --> 00:31:23,976
Never forget this moment

610
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:25,344
because l promise you

611
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:28,612
that one day, your children
and your grandchildren

612
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:30,551
will ask you what it was like

613
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:32,884
the day Li Nalas
returned to Bajor.

614
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:47,132
l hope you'll find
these quarters satisfactory.

615
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:52,005
Commander...

616
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:58,310
l just spent ten years
in a Cardassian labor camp.

617
00:31:59,953 --> 00:32:02,080
l'm just grateful...

618
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:03,953
for a moment's privacy.

619
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,256
Enjoy it while you can.

620
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:09,728
Judging from the crowd
on the Promenade

621
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,594
a moment may be all you get.

622
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:18,529
l thought they would have
forgotten me by now.

623
00:32:18,572 --> 00:32:20,540
lt appears you were wrong.

624
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:23,370
This morning, l was a slave.

625
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,981
Tonight, l am a hero.

626
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,279
lt must seem
a little overwhelming.

627
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:34,378
l tell you what is
overwhelming, Commander.

628
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:40,621
lt's knowing that something
l have waited for my whole life

629
00:32:40,661 --> 00:32:43,755
has finally happened.

630
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,788
The Cardassians are gone.

631
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,027
We won.

632
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:52,833
You've been there recently.

633
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:58,707
What's it like, a free Bajor?

634
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:03,273
l think you'll be pleased,
for the most part.

635
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:04,477
For the most part?

636
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:07,419
Bajor lacks strong leadership.

637
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,523
So that's what Major Kira meant.

638
00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:18,526
On the runabout,
she told me that my return

639
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:21,090
would bring stability to Bajor.

640
00:33:21,135 --> 00:33:22,295
She's right.

641
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:25,669
Bajor could use your help,
and frankly, so could l.

642
00:33:27,774 --> 00:33:31,107
But before you go off
saving Bajor

643
00:33:31,145 --> 00:33:33,306
l suppose you could use
a good night's sleep.

644
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:41,310
lt sounds
like l'm going to need it.

645
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:54,593
One for you...

646
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:57,069
and six for me.

647
00:33:59,006 --> 00:34:01,600
One for you and...

648
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:03,303
six for me.

649
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:05,941
One for you...

650
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,775
and six for me.

651
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:10,112
Would you stop
looking so glum?

652
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,517
Payday is supposed
to be a time of... joy.

653
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:15,385
l know, brother

654
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:18,186
but, every week,
it's the same thing.

655
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,160
Six for you
and only one for me.

656
00:34:21,195 --> 00:34:22,184
lt's not fair!

657
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,922
You're right.

658
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:26,557
l am?

659
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,364
Yes. lt's not fair.

660
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:30,392
lt's not?

661
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:32,337
Absolutely not.

662
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,968
One for you...

663
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,545
and...

664
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:42,381
...seven

665
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,781
for me.

666
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:48,146
One for you, and...

667
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:49,849
seven for me.

668
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,414
ls that better?

669
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,619
And where are you going?

670
00:34:55,662 --> 00:34:59,996
To bed, to dream
of an equal share of profits.

671
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,591
Dream on.

672
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:07,306
One for you...

673
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:10,174
and seven for me.

674
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:13,204
What is it now?

675
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:30,520
Quark... Quark!
Hold still.

676
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:33,355
Doctor...

677
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:35,961
will there be a scar?

678
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:37,333
l said, hold still.

679
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:38,770
Does that mean yes?

680
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:43,071
No, this dermal regenerator
should repair any damaged tissue

681
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,839
as well as prevent scarring.

682
00:35:44,878 --> 00:35:48,814
Unless, of course,
you don't hold still.

683
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:50,976
Did you recognize
any of your assailants?

684
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:52,848
They were wearing masks.

685
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:55,116
Are you sure they didn't
say anything?

686
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:56,452
Not a word.

687
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,787
They came in,
branded me and left.

688
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,292
The Promenade is usually
deserted at this hour.

689
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,124
No one saw them
enter or leave.

690
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:04,392
Constable, l want
all security personnel

691
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:05,455
put on full alert.

692
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,228
l've already seen to it.

693
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:09,064
Who was responsible for this?

694
00:36:09,102 --> 00:36:13,937
An extremist group from Bajor
who call themselves the Circle.

695
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,305
Bajorans did this?

696
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:18,004
l'm afraid so.

697
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:20,308
But why?

698
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:24,807
Their goal is to rid Bajor
of all non-Bajorans.

699
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,648
Hasn't the provisional
government

700
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:27,949
tried to stop them?

701
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,148
Oh, they've tried,
but the truth is

702
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,057
the Circle is more organized
than the government.

703
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:34,617
Well, the government
better get organized

704
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:36,959
because l intend to sue them
for financial compensation.

705
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,190
Not now, Quark!

706
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,163
People have grown impatient

707
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:43,863
with the government's inability
to get things done

708
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,929
so they turn to the Circle.

709
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:47,200
Constable.

710
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:52,776
We need someone to speak out
against these reactionaries--

711
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:55,304
someone the people
will listen to.

712
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:58,343
There.

713
00:36:58,385 --> 00:36:59,852
That should do it.

714
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:09,355
How do l look?

715
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:12,422
As... handsome as ever.

716
00:37:16,837 --> 00:37:18,805
Really?

717
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:19,897
Huh.

718
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,305
Huh.

719
00:37:26,142 --> 00:37:28,770
Jake, what are you doing up?

720
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:31,439
l couldn't sleep.

721
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:33,779
How was your date?

722
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:36,478
lt was tonight, wasn't it?

723
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:38,248
lt was supposed to be.

724
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:40,312
She couldn't make it.

725
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:42,449
lt happens.

726
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:46,121
She said her father
wouldn't let her go out with me.

727
00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:47,527
Why not?

728
00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:50,828
Because l'm not a Bajoran.

729
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,936
That's not much of a reason.

730
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:00,769
Oh, Jake.

731
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:07,242
There are some things
happening on Bajor.

732
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:09,444
Troubling things.

733
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:16,088
l'm sorry you've become
a victim of them.

734
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:18,423
You don't deserve it.

735
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:20,292
Nobody does.

736
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:32,437
Time for bed, okay?

737
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:34,466
Okay.

738
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:36,972
Night, Dad.

739
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:44,286
Commander,
there's a call for you

740
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,051
from the Tygarian freighter
docked on Upper Pylon 2.

741
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,115
Put it through.

742
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,219
Commander Sisko,
l am Romah Doek

743
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:55,423
Executive Officer of the <i>Nanut.</i>

744
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:58,491
We were preparing to depart
this station for Gamma Quadrant

745
00:38:58,534 --> 00:39:00,434
when we discovered
a Bajoran citizen

746
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,836
trying to stow away on our ship.

747
00:39:02,872 --> 00:39:05,568
l was hoping you would know
what to do with him.

748
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:16,084
The <i>Nanut</i> isn't scheduled

749
00:39:16,118 --> 00:39:18,882
to return from the Gamma
Quadrant for two years.

750
00:39:18,988 --> 00:39:21,354
Actually, l planned
on staying considerably longer.

751
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,789
l don't follow.

752
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:36,101
Commander, l'm going
to tell you a story...

753
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:38,368
and you may even believe it.

754
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:39,897
l'm listening.

755
00:39:39,976 --> 00:39:41,739
During the occupation

756
00:39:41,777 --> 00:39:44,439
l was a member
of a minor resistance cell.

757
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,777
Name's unimportant.

758
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:48,113
One day-- this was
in the mountains

759
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,277
surrounding
the Sahving Valley--

760
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:52,787
we were ambushed
by Cardassian troops.

761
00:39:52,822 --> 00:39:55,916
Only three of us
managed to escape.

762
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:57,617
We hid in the hills
for two days.

763
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,924
Finally, the lack
of food and water

764
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:02,088
forced us down into the valley.

765
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:06,295
We made our way to a ridge
overlooking a small lake.

766
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:09,304
As l was the only one
still carrying a phaser

767
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:12,136
l went on ahead
to scout for the enemy.

768
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:15,405
Halfway down the embankment,
l slipped...

769
00:40:15,444 --> 00:40:17,935
went sprawling on my back
down to the edge of the lake

770
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:20,346
just as a huge Cardassian
emerged from the water.

771
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:22,817
He must have
just finished bathing.

772
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:23,944
He stood there...

773
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,317
frozen in surprise

774
00:40:25,354 --> 00:40:27,322
dressed only in his underwear

775
00:40:27,356 --> 00:40:29,654
shivering in the cold.

776
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:32,661
l lay there, looking up at him,
too stunned to even move.

777
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:36,426
And it was only when he reached
for a phaser rifle

778
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:38,729
that was lying across
his clothes on a nearby rock

779
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:41,794
that l realized that l was
still holding my own phaser

780
00:40:41,837 --> 00:40:43,134
and l shot him.

781
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:45,504
His body fell on top of me.

782
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:48,635
And that's how my companions
found us a moment later.

783
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:52,808
One of them recognized him
as, uh, Gul Zarale

784
00:40:52,848 --> 00:40:55,976
responsible for the massacre
of half a dozen

785
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:57,552
Bajoran villages.

786
00:40:57,587 --> 00:40:59,953
Now, l tried to tell
them what had happened

787
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:02,753
but they had already
convinced themselves

788
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:06,751
that l had killed Zarale in
some kind of a savage struggle

789
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:08,423
which is what they insisted

790
00:41:08,464 --> 00:41:10,728
on telling every
Bajoran that we met.

791
00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:13,394
And no matter how hard
l tried to deny it

792
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:15,199
the story continued to spread

793
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:17,797
until it seemed
all of Bajor had heard it.

794
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,673
Soon every victory
won by the resistance

795
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,042
was attributed to my leadership.

796
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,277
Stories of my brilliance,
my daring, my courage

797
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:29,784
grew more and more unbelievable

798
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:32,788
yet the people
insisted on believing them.

799
00:41:32,822 --> 00:41:35,484
My reputation even followed me
into the labor camp

800
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:39,654
where my mere presence seemed
to inspire my fellow prisoners.

801
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:41,822
And l had done nothing

802
00:41:41,864 --> 00:41:47,359
but shoot an unarmed Cardassian
in his underwear.

803
00:41:47,403 --> 00:41:50,736
l'll never forget the look
on his face when he died.

804
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:54,971
He was so... embarrassed.

805
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:57,272
So you see, Commander

806
00:41:57,313 --> 00:42:00,544
l have done
what Bajor needed me to do.

807
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,016
l have allowed myself

808
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:06,454
to be a slave to my reputation
all of these years.

809
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:07,786
And now...

810
00:42:07,823 --> 00:42:10,815
it is enough.

811
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:14,694
They still need you.

812
00:42:16,332 --> 00:42:19,790
But l am not the man
that they think l am.

813
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:22,303
Perhaps not.

814
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:25,307
But Bajor doesn't need a man.

815
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,933
lt needs a symbol

816
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:28,806
and that's what you are.

817
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:32,143
No one's asking you
to lead troops into battle

818
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:34,479
or to kill
a hundred Cardassians

819
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:36,007
with your bare hands.

820
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:39,821
l saw you...

821
00:42:39,855 --> 00:42:43,154
in front of the crowd
on the Promenade.

822
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:45,160
They look at you

823
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:50,257
and they see strength
and honor and decency.

824
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:54,292
They look at you and see
the best in themselves.

825
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:58,436
But it's all based on a lie.

826
00:42:58,474 --> 00:43:01,637
No. lt's based on a legend.

827
00:43:03,145 --> 00:43:06,603
And legends are as powerful
as any truth.

828
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:10,107
Bajor still needs that legend.

829
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:11,813
lt needs you.

830
00:43:22,264 --> 00:43:24,459
The Yelikan transport
is ready for departure.

831
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,300
Opening mooring clamps
on Docking Bay Six.

832
00:43:28,337 --> 00:43:29,668
Major.

833
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:37,646
Commander.

834
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,806
Minister Jaro.

835
00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:39,815
Li.

836
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:40,941
Navarch Li--

837
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,484
as of yesterday's
unanimous assembly vote.

838
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:44,952
Congratulations.

839
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,146
Navarch...

840
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:47,655
there's never been one before.

841
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,318
They felt any existing title
was inadequate

842
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:52,418
so they created
a new one for me.

843
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:54,258
l hear that thousands
of people showed up

844
00:43:54,296 --> 00:43:56,594
to greet your ship
when it arrived on Bajor.

845
00:43:56,632 --> 00:43:58,600
Yes, it was
quite a celebration.

846
00:43:58,634 --> 00:44:00,761
l wish l could
have stayed longer.

847
00:44:00,803 --> 00:44:02,100
Why? What stopped you?

848
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:04,732
The Navarch needed to return
here to assume his new post.

849
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:08,175
He's been made the Bajoran
Liaison Officer to Deep Space 9.

850
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,838
l already have
a liaison officer.

851
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,541
Not anymore, you don't.

852
00:44:12,581 --> 00:44:15,277
Major Kira is no longer
assigned to this post.

853
00:44:15,317 --> 00:44:17,308
She's been recalled to Bajor.
