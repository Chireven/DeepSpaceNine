1
00:00:02,194 --> 00:00:05,925
Medical Log, Stardate 47229.1.

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,558
Chief O'Brien and l
have been working overtime

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,364
to prepare for the arrival
of a new cartographer.

4
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:15,134
Ensign Melora Pazlar is the
first Elaysian to join Starfleet

5
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:18,836
and, as such, requires
special accommodations.

6
00:00:18,877 --> 00:00:21,539
l haven't seen one
of these in 300 years.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,343
l'm surprised
it was even on file

8
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:25,179
in the replicator's data bank.

9
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:26,309
lt isn't.

10
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:28,615
Ensign Pazlar sent me
the specifications.

11
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,053
She really uses one like this?

12
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:32,613
Her normal anti-grav unit
isn't going to work here.

13
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,786
Same problem we had with
the Starfleet cargo lifts.

14
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,523
Cardassian construction
just isn't compatible.

15
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:39,860
Ops to Bashir.

16
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:42,867
The <i>Yellowstone</i> has just
docked at Airlock 14, Doctor.

17
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,801
We're on our way.

18
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,138
Just think of what she's gone
through to get here, Jadzia.

19
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,871
What it must be like
to adjust to our gravity

20
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:55,209
after growing up on a planet
with such low surface gravity.

21
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:57,545
Doctor, we've done
the best we can with the ramps.

22
00:00:57,582 --> 00:00:59,948
The Cardassians obviously
didn't have her in mind

23
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:01,316
when they built this place.

24
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,947
Well, l've managed to modify
the maximum vertical clearance

25
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,549
of the chair three centimeters,
to a slope of 56 degrees.

26
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:07,819
Well, that still leaves
a lot of places

27
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,053
around here
she won't have access to.

28
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:10,493
Can't we just use
the transporter

29
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,518
to help her get around?

30
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:12,894
lt makes sense to me

31
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:15,866
but she sent word that it
wasn't acceptable to her.

32
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:17,163
l wonder why.

33
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,102
l know exactly why.

34
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:20,570
She went through Academy
the same way.

35
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:21,799
Once her basic needs are met

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,808
she refuses
any special assistance.

37
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:25,139
She's extraordinary.

38
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:27,737
You make it sound as though
you've known her for years.

39
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:29,713
l almost feel as though l have.

40
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:33,377
l've pulled all her personnel
and medical files to get ready.

41
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:35,318
Her quarters--
they're ready, aren't they?

42
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:37,652
l've got the bumps on the head
to prove it.

43
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:38,849
Thanks, Chief.

44
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,188
Let me know if there's
anything else l can do.

45
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,821
That'll be something to see--
when we switch off the gravity

46
00:01:44,863 --> 00:01:46,763
and she flies around the room.

47
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:12,480
Ensign Melora Pazlar
reporting for duty.

48
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:13,752
Welcome to DS9, Ensign.

49
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:16,124
l'm Chief Science Officer
Jadzia Dax

50
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:17,128
and this is...

51
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:18,789
Dr. Bashir,
we spoke on subspace.

52
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,058
Good to meet you in person.

53
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,429
l see you have my trolley car
ready to go.

54
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,433
As requested.

55
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:23,434
Can l help?

56
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:25,368
l'm fine, thank you.

57
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:37,841
That's better.

58
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:39,475
You've modified it.

59
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:42,885
Yes, l wanted to give you
as much mobility as l could.

60
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:44,183
l've been practicing

61
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:46,588
on the model
l requested for a month.

62
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,649
Well, it's no problem.

63
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:49,819
We can replicate
the other design.

64
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:52,352
No, l'll just have to adapt.

65
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,738
l will be accompanying you
on your survey mission.

66
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:02,569
l really don't think that'll be
necessary, Lieutenant.

67
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:05,405
l'm perfectly capable
of piloting a runabout.

68
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,036
Commander Sisko
thought that it...

69
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:08,807
l'm sure he thought
what every officer

70
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:10,439
l've ever served with
has thought--

71
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,916
that l need extra help
to get the job done.

72
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:14,077
Please tell him l don't.

73
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:16,587
Commander Sisko
wouldn't allow any Ensign

74
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:18,145
to take a runabout
into the Gamma Quadrant

75
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:19,245
the day after she arrives.

76
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,724
l'm sure
the Chief Science Officer

77
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,056
has more important
things to do

78
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:24,721
than chart a sector
in the Gamma Quadrant.

79
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:27,163
Um, here we are.

80
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:28,698
You didn't modify
the specifications

81
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,166
l gave you for my quarters,
did you?

82
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:31,361
Not one iota.

83
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,769
You can control the gravity unit
with this device.

84
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:35,033
lf you'd care to try it out...

85
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:36,165
Thank you, l will.

86
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,006
lt was a pleasure
meeting both of you.

87
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:48,017
Paltriss only created
80 of them, each a...

88
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:49,746
a work of art.

89
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:53,051
And l've come into
the possession of 42.

90
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,523
Forty-two?

91
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:58,284
My world will honor your name

92
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:00,796
for returning
the rings of Paltriss

93
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,162
to his birthplace.

94
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,223
Honor my name all you like

95
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:04,996
as long as your honor
is accompanied

96
00:06:05,035 --> 00:06:08,937
by 199 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

97
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:14,641
l heard you drive
a hard bargain.

98
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:17,875
Shall we celebrate
our closing the deal

99
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:19,542
with another drink?

100
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:26,846
Excuse me.

101
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,051
l'm sorry.

102
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:30,252
We're not open yet

103
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:32,091
but if you'll come back in...

104
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:37,891
Have another drink on me.

105
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,170
Fallit Kot, is it really you?

106
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,234
How long has it been?

107
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:51,679
Eight years.
Eight long years.

108
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:54,081
Oh, it can't be.

109
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:58,679
l must say, you look terrific.

110
00:06:58,722 --> 00:06:59,950
Tanned, toned up...

111
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,151
all that baby fat
has disappeared

112
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:03,420
from your face.

113
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,054
You don't keep extra weight on
where l've been.

114
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:08,959
Just passing through are you?

115
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,832
l bet you have business
in the Gamma Quadrant.

116
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:14,359
You always had a sharp eye
for fresh territory.

117
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,872
Oh, l'm not going
to the Gamma Quadrant.

118
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:19,375
My business is
right here with you.

119
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:20,467
With me?

120
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,704
That's right.

121
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:26,748
l've come to kill you, Quark.

122
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,815
l've gone through
her mission profile

123
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:37,952
and she certainly seems
to know what she's doing.

124
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:39,326
Nevertheless, this is

125
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:40,728
her first deep
space assignment.

126
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,425
And it doesn't make
sense to me to...

127
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:46,993
Here she is.

128
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:53,776
Welcome, Ensign.

129
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,574
l'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.

130
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:58,274
Am l late?

131
00:07:58,315 --> 00:07:59,976
No, not at all.

132
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:02,747
lt looked as though the meeting
had already begun.

133
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,117
Dax and Bashir
were just telling me

134
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:05,985
about your request
to pilot a runabout alone.

135
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:11,986
Wouldn't it have
been more appropriate

136
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,395
to include me
in that conversation?

137
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:16,023
l was getting a briefing

138
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,226
by my senior officers, Ensign.

139
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:21,260
We discuss personnel
matters all the time.

140
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:24,239
l'm sorry if l seem
overly sensitive

141
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:28,540
but l'm used to being shut out
of the ''Melora problem.''

142
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:32,014
The truth is, there is
no ''Melora problem''

143
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,313
until people create one.

144
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:40,312
This may sound ungrateful

145
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:43,190
because Dr. Bashir has
been wonderfully helpful

146
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:45,592
in the preparations
for my arrival

147
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:48,689
but frankly, l wonder
why a medical opinion

148
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:51,257
is necessary
in this discussion.

149
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:53,269
Julian knows more
of your capabilities

150
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:54,998
than any of us.

151
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,768
l don't need a medical opinion
to tell me my own capabilities.

152
00:08:57,808 --> 00:08:59,275
-Ensign...
-l simply object

153
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,504
to being treated
like someone who is ill.

154
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,513
l don't see anybody doing that.

155
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:05,845
Try sitting in the
chair, Commander.

156
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:09,579
No one can understand
until they sit in the chair.

157
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:17,853
l've been in one chair
or another

158
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:19,327
since l left my home world.

159
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:22,865
My family gave me this cane.

160
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:26,062
lt's made from the wood
of a garlanic tree.

161
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,560
They had no idea
what it would be like

162
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:29,697
to live off-world

163
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,504
in what you consider
''normal'' gravity.

164
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:35,238
Only a handful of Elaysians
have ever left home

165
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:37,940
but l always knew
that l had to be one of them.

166
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:42,042
l dreamt about exploring
the stars as a child

167
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:46,612
and l wasn't going to allow
any... handicap--

168
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:50,752
not a chair,
not a Cardassian station--

169
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:53,490
to stop me
from chasing that dream.

170
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,361
You must feel
a great deal of pride

171
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:57,161
about everything
you've achieved.

172
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,430
And l've achieved that,
Commander

173
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:01,869
without being dependent
on anybody.

174
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:06,342
To be honest,
l prefer to work alone.

175
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:08,207
lt's simply easier for me.

176
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:10,535
l am not comfortable

177
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,741
sending you alone
into the Gamma Quadrant.

178
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:16,549
Sir... l can focus
on the job better.

179
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:19,646
l-l can work at my own pace
without being a bother

180
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:21,486
to anyone else.

181
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:24,358
Lieutenant Dax will
be going with you.

182
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,358
Yes, sir.

183
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:33,466
When do you wish to leave,
Lieutenant?

184
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:36,696
Your schedule is fine with me.

185
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,470
Then tomorrow at 0730.

186
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:57,789
ls it working?

187
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:00,058
The low-grav
field actuator.

188
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:02,064
l just heard it go off.

189
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:03,793
lt's working fine.

190
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:05,529
So you were just...

191
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:07,298
Oh, um... for me

192
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:10,864
it's like slipping
into a hot tub

193
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:13,535
at the end of a long day.

194
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:15,272
Really?

195
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:19,541
l'm a shower man, myself.

196
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,014
Look at this.

197
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,421
ls this your husband?

198
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:27,684
Boyfriend?

199
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:32,457
Doctor, if you came
for an apology...

200
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,053
l apologize.

201
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:35,724
Apology?

202
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:39,064
My speech wasn't intended
to attack you personally.

203
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:44,504
l'm sure you never set out
to attack anyone personally

204
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,805
but you do seem to attack a lot.

205
00:11:46,843 --> 00:11:49,334
That's rather insensitive
of you, Doctor.

206
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:50,573
Julian.

207
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:52,514
l'm no longer your doctor.

208
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:53,880
l see.

209
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,908
You've decided l need a friend.

210
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:58,113
Ooh, was that an attack?

211
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:01,248
You see, you do it so well,
with such charm

212
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,883
it's hard to tell.

213
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:06,590
l really don't mean to...

214
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,621
Sure you do.

215
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:09,962
l beg your pardon?

216
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,661
Of course you mean to.

217
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:14,340
All of these broad shots
you fire--

218
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:15,497
they're just your way

219
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,805
of keeping the rest of the
universe on the defensive.

220
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:19,140
Has to be.

221
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:20,770
You're too good at it.

222
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:22,212
Well, uh...

223
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:25,740
it always seemed to work
pretty well.

224
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:27,776
Until now.

225
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:32,182
Well, that is the nicest thing
you've said to me.

226
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:35,625
Or anybody else.

227
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:37,890
Are you hungry?

228
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:40,560
l came here

229
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,726
thinking about
asking you to dinner.

230
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:44,895
Then afterwards,
we'll go dancing

231
00:12:44,937 --> 00:12:45,904
l suppose.

232
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:47,132
Ooh, Red Alert.

233
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:52,002
l'm sorry.

234
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:54,777
Well, come on.

235
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:57,977
There's a new Klingon
restaurant open on the Promenade

236
00:12:58,017 --> 00:13:00,008
if... you like
that sort of thing.

237
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:02,982
All right.

238
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:26,039
Dinner is served.

239
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:27,612
l didn't
order dinner.

240
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:29,671
What better way to mollify--

241
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,781
satisfy a hungry traveler

242
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:36,219
than with a delicious
home-cooked meal?

243
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:41,693
Starting with a delicate
Vak clover soup.

244
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:55,236
Why spoil your appetite
with soup?

245
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:57,435
Here's the real treat.

246
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:04,641
Jumbo Vulcan mollusks
sautéed in rhombolian butter--

247
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:07,777
a taste so exquisite,
it's to die for.

248
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,151
Uh...

249
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:10,655
or to live for, for that matter.

250
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:14,216
Do you know dabo, Fallit?

251
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,490
lt's a wonderfully
entertaining game

252
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:17,689
and easy to learn.

253
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:21,155
l took the liberty of lining up

254
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,532
a couple
of excellent tutors l know.

255
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:26,999
Be sure to ask them

256
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,837
about their ''double down''
betting strategy.

257
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:37,210
lf l haven't made it clear,
l intend your stay here

258
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:41,777
to be as pleasurable
as you could ever imagine.

259
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,946
So...

260
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:48,356
allow me to propose a toast.

261
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:49,918
To...

262
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:52,958
old friends.

263
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:55,091
Old debts.

264
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:59,733
<i>Gagh Tek Or?.</i>

265
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:01,103
Shall l order for us both?

266
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,232
All right.

267
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:03,298
Um, let's see now.

268
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:04,639
We'll have some <i>racht,</i>
of course.

269
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:05,905
<i>racht...</i>

270
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:07,640
And a double order

271
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,978
of <i>gladst,</i> no sauce, please.

272
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:11,710
<i>gladst... usu bal.</i>

273
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,846
And a side order
of <i>zilm'kach.</i>

274
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:17,981
ls that too much for two?

275
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,221
<i>zilm'kach.</i>

276
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:24,387
<i>Drak doo.</i>

277
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,488
May l?

278
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:26,930
Don't be alarmed.

279
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:30,130
Excuse me, Julian,
l can't eat this.

280
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,500
l know how it looks, but...

281
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:33,471
<i>P'kar tel Durg Le Frakn'l?</i>

282
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:34,938
<i>Dug a bul, rah'tar!</i>

283
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:36,441
<i>D'tel klop a bul!</i>

284
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:37,908
<i>Pak't pol!</i>

285
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:39,570
<i>D'kar tel G'denna!</i>

286
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:45,310
l like a customer
who knows what she wants.

287
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:53,683
<i>G'denna.</i>

288
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:56,627
There's nothing worse
than half-dead <i>racht.</i>

289
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,394
<i>Gagh Tek Or!</i>

290
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,606
l was ten.

291
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,312
My father was
a Federation diplomat

292
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:22,479
on lnvernia ll.

293
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:23,818
One day, when we were

294
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:25,983
out on a remote
part of the planet

295
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,550
we were hit
by a massive ionic storm

296
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:31,028
and while we were
waiting it out

297
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:35,192
we found an lnvernian girl,
about my age, who was sick.

298
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:38,601
After the storm cleared,
my father went for help

299
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:40,298
but it was too late.

300
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,899
l sat there and watched her die.

301
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:45,034
The next day, when he returned

302
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:48,513
his guide told us that we
could have treated her

303
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:51,983
with a simple herb
that was growing all around.

304
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:55,616
l could have saved her life.

305
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,688
And so you started
to study medicine.

306
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:05,220
Actually, first
l started to study tennis.

307
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:06,424
Tennis?

308
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:08,729
l really thought l could
make a career out of it.

309
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:10,132
You must be very good.

310
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:11,966
Well, l used to think so

311
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:15,405
but then l went to my
first major competition.

312
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,272
My opponent served first

313
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:19,800
and l heard the ball
bounce past me.

314
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:21,745
The computer announced
it was good

315
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,577
and l realized
l was in trouble.

316
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:27,483
Turned out, l had more talent
at medicine than tennis.

317
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:40,687
Well, l, um, have
an early mission tomorrow.

318
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,894
l better get some rest.

319
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:49,305
Of course.

320
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,787
Dax to Pazlar.

321
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:14,389
Computer,
level-1 security access.

322
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:17,162
Ensign Pazlar?

323
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:21,835
Computer, locate
Ensign Melora Pazlar.

324
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:24,707
Docking Level 22, Section 14.

325
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:26,301
Section 14?

326
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:39,987
We need to get you
to the lnfirmary.

327
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:42,152
lt's my own fault.

328
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:43,422
l decided...

329
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:45,760
l could use an extra
astrometric array

330
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:48,266
after going through
the mission profile again.

331
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,291
l came to the storage
bay to get one.

332
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:52,769
My mind was already
in the Gamma Quadrant.

333
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:54,796
l wasn't... paying
enough attention

334
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,068
to what l was doing.

335
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:58,042
l guess my boot

336
00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:00,044
didn't make the lip
of the door.

337
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:02,137
l fell on my controls.

338
00:19:02,181 --> 00:19:03,375
Dax to Bashir.

339
00:19:03,415 --> 00:19:06,213
Ensign Pazlar's had
a, uh, minor accident.

340
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:07,616
We need to see you
in the lnfirmary.

341
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:09,848
Acknowledged.
l'll be there in three minutes.

342
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:12,982
What kind of an architect
would deliberately design

343
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:15,687
a raised rim
at the entrance to every door?

344
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:21,911
So much for the dangers
of the Gamma Quadrant.

345
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:23,851
l didn't even make it there.

346
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:25,717
You will.

347
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:26,778
There's no concussion.

348
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:28,983
You can reschedule
your mission for tomorrow.

349
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:31,684
lt was so...

350
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:37,792
Flopping back and forth
like a broken toy.

351
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,358
l didn't want anyone
to find me like that

352
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,461
but l couldn't
get up by myself.

353
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,097
Why didn't you wait for Dax

354
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,938
before you went into an area
that was unmodified with ramps?

355
00:19:46,976 --> 00:19:48,375
l didn't need Dax

356
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,605
if l'd just paid attention.

357
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:52,944
Melora...

358
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:57,146
no one on this station
is completely independent.

359
00:19:57,186 --> 00:20:00,747
ln space, we all depend
on one another to some degree.

360
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:04,281
l just want you all to know
that you can depend on me.

361
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:05,691
You've proven that.

362
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:09,664
Now what do the rest of us
have to do to convince you?

363
00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:11,325
Of what?

364
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,858
That you can depend on us.

365
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:20,737
Have you ever heard of the work
Nathaniel Teros did

366
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:22,903
with low gravity species
30 years ago?

367
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:24,469
Neuromuscular adaptation.

368
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:26,276
lt had no practical
success at all.

369
00:20:26,315 --> 00:20:28,340
No, but the principles
were sound

370
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:29,976
and a lot of progress
has been made

371
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,816
in neurochemistry since then.

372
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:34,823
You think some day
l could throw away the chair?

373
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:39,388
Theoretically... perhaps.

374
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:46,334
Would you like to come in?

375
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:48,393
Oh, no, l know
how much you look forward

376
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:50,064
to turning down the gravity.

377
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:56,243
Don't let that stop you.

378
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:06,811
You may want to brace yourself
until you get used to it.

379
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:28,908
Come on, Julian.

380
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:36,375
What do l do?

381
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:38,477
Just give a gentle push.

382
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,782
lt's easy.

383
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:45,683
Oh... oh... oh...

384
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:49,255
Oh, oh... Oh!

385
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:51,960
This is astonishing!

386
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:54,868
l can't tell you how curious
l was about this.

387
00:21:56,071 --> 00:21:57,436
Oh.

388
00:21:57,473 --> 00:21:58,872
Most people are.

389
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:02,274
Sometimes they make me feel
like a carnival attraction.

390
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:04,939
So usually l prefer
to keep everyone out.

391
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,881
Well, thank you...
for letting me in.

392
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,681
He's my brother.

393
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:14,586
Who?

394
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:21,125
Oh.

395
00:23:03,072 --> 00:23:06,564
Setting course 28 mark 142.

396
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:07,939
Confirmed.

397
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:15,614
Computer...
any Vulcan études on file?

398
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:17,915
Affirmative.

399
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:20,888
lf you have no objections.

400
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:22,948
Computer, play us
something by Delvok.

401
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:26,954
Delvok never seems Vulcan to me.

402
00:23:26,995 --> 00:23:30,021
There's too much... emotion
in his music.

403
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:33,699
lt's pretty.

404
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:42,475
Tell me something, Lieutenant--

405
00:23:42,511 --> 00:23:47,244
you think there's room
for... romance in Starfleet?

406
00:23:47,282 --> 00:23:48,613
l think so.

407
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,117
You've made it work?

408
00:23:50,152 --> 00:23:52,347
Mmm, now and then.

409
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:54,253
l mean really work.

410
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:56,587
Oh... really work.

411
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,024
Yes.

412
00:23:58,093 --> 00:24:01,722
Well, for that,
l'd have to go back, um...

413
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:03,061
150 years.

414
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:04,497
Oh...

415
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:06,194
that's a long time.

416
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:10,604
Could it be that Dr. Bashir's
bedside manner has won you over?

417
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:17,470
Our species are just
so... different.

418
00:24:17,513 --> 00:24:19,845
Since when has that
ever stopped anyone?

419
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:21,782
l knew
a hydrogen-breathing lothra

420
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:24,513
who fell hopelessly in love
with an Oxygene.

421
00:24:24,553 --> 00:24:25,713
You're kidding.

422
00:24:25,754 --> 00:24:28,154
How could they even be
in the same room?

423
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,988
40 minutes a day without
their breathing apparatus.

424
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:31,993
That's all.

425
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,824
57 years they were together.

426
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:38,321
What-What about...
career conflicts?

427
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,835
Two friends of mine
from the Academy got engaged

428
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:42,700
even though they knew
they were being assigned

429
00:24:42,738 --> 00:24:43,705
to different starships.

430
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:44,899
Subspace relationships?

431
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,907
Mm-hmm.

432
00:24:45,941 --> 00:24:47,533
Oh, that's a tough one.

433
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:49,669
They may not be together
for a year or more

434
00:24:49,711 --> 00:24:51,838
and even then
for only a few weeks.

435
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,873
Love across light-years--
it's just so...

436
00:24:55,918 --> 00:24:57,647
lt lacks intimacy.

437
00:24:57,686 --> 00:24:59,654
You could say that.

438
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,622
l finish my mission here,
l move on to the next one.

439
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:09,097
What kind of future is that
for a romance?

440
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:12,123
Look at the alternative.

441
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:15,066
l guess.

442
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:22,634
Oh, it's you.

443
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:24,703
Don't be so happy to see me.

444
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:26,270
All right, l won't.

445
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:29,876
Odo, there's
a desperate criminal

446
00:25:29,918 --> 00:25:31,180
on board the station.

447
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,745
You wouldn't be talking
about Fallit Kot

448
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:36,280
who just finished eight years
at a labor camp

449
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:38,657
for hijacking a shipment
of Romulan ale

450
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:41,595
and whose name appears
right next to yours

451
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,961
on the original indictment?

452
00:25:42,998 --> 00:25:45,330
l had nothing to do
with the hijacking itself.

453
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:48,768
l was only the, uh... middleman.

454
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:50,999
Trafficking in stolen goods
should have been enough

455
00:25:51,106 --> 00:25:53,165
to get you your own cell
at that Romulan camp.

456
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:57,167
Unless, of course,
you sold out your partner.

457
00:25:57,212 --> 00:26:00,773
l can honestly say
justice was served.

458
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:02,909
l would imagine Fallit Kot

459
00:26:02,951 --> 00:26:05,977
is looking for his own
kind of justice now.

460
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,821
He threatened to kill me.

461
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:15,094
What?

462
00:26:15,227 --> 00:26:16,558
Nothing.

463
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:17,755
Just a passing thought.

464
00:26:17,796 --> 00:26:19,627
Odo, he means it.

465
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:23,567
Nothing l do
seems to change his mind.

466
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:25,092
You've got to do something.

467
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:27,697
l'll do my job, Quark.

468
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,537
Yeah.

469
00:26:32,044 --> 00:26:34,376
Unfortunately.

470
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:52,457
<i>racht,</i> anyone?

471
00:26:52,498 --> 00:26:53,658
l've been waiting for you.

472
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,166
l've got something to show you.

473
00:26:57,002 --> 00:26:58,731
What is it?

474
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:00,966
lt's a computer model
of an elevated neural output

475
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:02,564
from the brain's
gross motor cortex.

476
00:27:02,608 --> 00:27:03,905
lt's stimulating

477
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:06,876
acetylcholine absorption
to increase tensile strength.

478
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:08,504
The neuromuscular
adaptation theory?

479
00:27:08,547 --> 00:27:10,174
lt was theory 30 years ago

480
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:12,514
but with the development
of neo-analeptic transmitters

481
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:13,916
it's not even that complicated.

482
00:27:13,953 --> 00:27:15,545
lt's just
that no one's ever gone back

483
00:27:15,588 --> 00:27:17,385
to reexamine the ideas
of Nathaniel Teros.

484
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:19,288
Until now.

485
00:27:20,693 --> 00:27:22,354
This...

486
00:27:22,394 --> 00:27:24,191
could actually work?

487
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,095
No more servo controls.

488
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:27,655
No more chair.

489
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:01,899
Have l done something wrong?

490
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:03,959
Not that l'm aware of.

491
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:08,166
We have something in common.

492
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:09,640
We do?

493
00:28:09,675 --> 00:28:11,939
l don't like Quark either...

494
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,177
but l can't let you kill him.

495
00:28:15,214 --> 00:28:16,374
Kill him?

496
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:19,384
Did he tell you
l was going to do that?

497
00:28:19,418 --> 00:28:21,852
l know of your history together.

498
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:24,754
Let bygones be bygones,
l always say.

499
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:29,852
And l always say you can
tell a man's intentions

500
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:31,419
by the way he walks.

501
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:34,928
How do l walk?

502
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:38,767
Like someone carrying a lot
of weight on his shoulders.

503
00:28:38,804 --> 00:28:41,102
Must be the memory
of those Romulan bricks

504
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,607
l carried for eight years.

505
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:44,666
Must be.

506
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:50,046
But you can't lock a man up
for the way he walks, can you?

507
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:15,568
Well?

508
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:18,599
l'd say he's a man
with nothing to lose.

509
00:29:18,644 --> 00:29:20,009
As opposed to me.

510
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:23,674
l have no reason to hold him
for now and he knows it.

511
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:25,616
l'll watch him the best l can

512
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:28,415
but l suggest you carry
a combadge with you

513
00:29:28,454 --> 00:29:29,421
at all times.

514
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:30,922
Call me at the first
sign of trouble.

515
00:29:30,956 --> 00:29:34,221
What if the first sign
is the last sign?

516
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:36,659
You people sell
pieces of yourself

517
00:29:36,695 --> 00:29:38,356
after you die, don't you?

518
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:39,455
Yes.

519
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:40,988
l'll buy one.

520
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:47,598
My heart is pounding.

521
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:49,368
l'd like to think that
has more to do with me

522
00:29:49,408 --> 00:29:50,636
than the neo-analeptic infusion.

523
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:53,611
Would that also explain
why my backside is getting warm?

524
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:55,306
Well, that's more likely
the result

525
00:29:55,347 --> 00:29:57,110
the neuromuscular
tissue stimulation

526
00:29:57,149 --> 00:29:59,549
due to the increased activity
in the motor cortex.

527
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:02,179
l'd say that's enough
first time out.

528
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,148
lt's good that you've already

529
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:08,159
been using your muscles
in this gravity environment.

530
00:30:08,193 --> 00:30:09,592
lt'll make it easier to adapt.

531
00:30:09,628 --> 00:30:11,220
Feel any different?

532
00:30:11,263 --> 00:30:13,595
No.

533
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:16,100
Nothing at all?

534
00:30:16,135 --> 00:30:18,433
l'm sorry, Julian.

535
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:23,902
The acetylcholine absorption

536
00:30:23,942 --> 00:30:25,910
is precisely
at 14% above normal.

537
00:30:25,944 --> 00:30:29,744
lncreased tensile strength
would be the inevitable result.

538
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:31,010
Julian?

539
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:37,954
l can lift my leg.

540
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,187
Your neural pathways
are beginning to adapt.

541
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:44,593
Endurance and coordination
might take a while

542
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:49,533
but we should have you walking
within the hour.

543
00:30:55,808 --> 00:30:57,673
How's the upgrade coming?

544
00:30:57,709 --> 00:30:59,540
We've been able to get it
to about 70%

545
00:30:59,578 --> 00:31:01,307
of what we'd get
with a standard EPS

546
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:03,143
but it looks like
that's going to be...

547
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:05,947
Well, l'll be damned.

548
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,487
l wanted to give you

549
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:11,955
our first day's mission summary
myself, Commander.

550
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,719
A pleasure, Ensign.

551
00:31:15,194 --> 00:31:17,094
Julian, how did you, uh...?

552
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:18,960
Oh, it was simply a matter
of increasing the output

553
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:20,123
on the brain's motor cortex.

554
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:21,530
Someone else's research,
actually.

555
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:23,296
l just dotted the l's
and crossed the T's.

556
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:24,359
Well, you'll get your name

557
00:31:24,403 --> 00:31:25,961
in the medical journals
for this one.

558
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:26,969
Yeah, l know, l...

559
00:31:27,072 --> 00:31:28,130
Julian...

560
00:31:28,173 --> 00:31:29,572
l don't know
how to tell you this

561
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:30,973
but l'm not sure
l can make it...

562
00:31:31,076 --> 00:31:32,304
Easy does it now.

563
00:31:32,344 --> 00:31:34,972
lt's just the first day's
treatment beginning to wear off.

564
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:35,980
Thank you.

565
00:31:36,014 --> 00:31:37,106
Nothing to be concerned about.

566
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:38,741
Look, l better get you
back to your quarters.

567
00:31:38,784 --> 00:31:40,411
l want you to get a good
night's rest tonight.

568
00:31:40,452 --> 00:31:41,419
Oh, thank you.

569
00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:43,045
Habitat Ring, Level 14.

570
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:53,497
With each progressive treatment,
you should get stronger

571
00:31:53,532 --> 00:31:56,160
and the effects
should last longer.

572
00:31:58,103 --> 00:31:59,627
What about this?

573
00:31:59,671 --> 00:32:01,332
A low-grav environment now

574
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:04,001
would really confuse
your motor cortex.

575
00:32:06,178 --> 00:32:07,509
l understand.

576
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:12,678
Julian...

577
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:17,849
You let me fly
for the first time.

578
00:32:19,358 --> 00:32:21,952
l let you walk.

579
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,527
We're even.

580
00:32:27,933 --> 00:32:29,423
l'll see you in the morning.

581
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:43,712
Lights.

582
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:48,516
Computer, turn on...

583
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:03,902
Quark to Odo...

584
00:33:03,936 --> 00:33:05,563
No one can hear you, Quark.

585
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:06,902
lt's just you and me.

586
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:08,463
Fallit.

587
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:11,476
Oh, l wasn't prepared
to entertain this evening

588
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,171
but make yourself at home.

589
00:33:13,212 --> 00:33:14,474
Oh, l already have.

590
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:16,276
What's mine is yours.

591
00:33:16,315 --> 00:33:17,577
All you have to do is ask.

592
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:19,175
l'm tired of your gifts, Quark.

593
00:33:19,218 --> 00:33:22,654
All l want
is your miserable life.

594
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,213
Wait!
Everything's negotiable.

595
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:27,926
Believe me...

596
00:33:28,027 --> 00:33:29,927
l'm worth much more
to you alive.

597
00:33:29,962 --> 00:33:31,020
How's that?

598
00:33:31,063 --> 00:33:35,295
How does 199 bars

599
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:38,303
of gold-pressed latinum
sound to you?

600
00:33:44,577 --> 00:33:46,374
lt's a start.

601
00:33:56,155 --> 00:33:57,952
The mattress felt like rocks

602
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,118
and every one of my muscles
ached all night long.

603
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,288
You'll adjust to that
after a few more treatments.

604
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,993
This time the effects
should last for several hours.

605
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:15,906
Exactly when does this
become irreversible?

606
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:19,741
Melora...
if you're not certain...

607
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:20,871
No, l'm sure it's just

608
00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:23,404
some strange form
of buyer's remorse.

609
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,643
l'll be fine.

610
00:34:24,684 --> 00:34:28,017
Tell me exactly
what you're feeling.

611
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,351
Last night, l just missed...

612
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:38,356
l didn't feel like me.

613
00:34:39,465 --> 00:34:40,932
lf you want to end
your dependence

614
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,935
on the chair
and the servo controls

615
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:46,368
you're going to have to give up
the low-grav environment.

616
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:48,600
You knew
that that was the trade-off.

617
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:50,609
And it seemed like a good trade.

618
00:34:50,643 --> 00:34:53,237
Until l realized
l couldn't do it anymore.

619
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:54,803
lf l could just spend...

620
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:57,816
l'm just concerned
that going back and forth

621
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:01,479
could ultimately lead
to a loss of fine motor control.

622
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,782
Meaning?

623
00:35:02,822 --> 00:35:05,052
Your ability to perform
complex tasks

624
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:06,251
could be affected.

625
00:35:10,062 --> 00:35:13,554
The effects are fully reversible
for the next few days.

626
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,500
We can pull the plug
at any time before then.

627
00:35:16,535 --> 00:35:18,560
But after that, if all goes well

628
00:35:18,604 --> 00:35:22,062
your motor cortex impulses
will kick in on their own.

629
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:23,507
Permanently.

630
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:37,845
lt's starting to wear off again.

631
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:50,398
l don't understand myself.

632
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:54,031
How could l possibly
have second thoughts?

633
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:56,940
This would mean
real independence.

634
00:35:57,009 --> 00:35:59,978
lt's everything
l ever wished for.

635
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:03,581
But then l start
to think about home

636
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:05,777
and how l won't ever
be able to go back.

637
00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:07,752
Well, maybe just
for a short visit

638
00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:12,087
but... never really go back.

639
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:17,122
<i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

640
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,627
Mermaid?

641
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:22,600
lt's an Earth fable
by Hans Christian Andersen.

642
00:36:22,635 --> 00:36:26,071
She trades
her magical life under the sea

643
00:36:26,105 --> 00:36:29,074
for a pair of legs
to walk on land.

644
00:36:30,509 --> 00:36:33,000
Didn't she live
happily ever after?

645
00:36:45,858 --> 00:36:48,622
Ashrok.
Right on time.

646
00:36:50,663 --> 00:36:54,531
May l present my longtime
business partner, Fallit Kot.

647
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:03,573
For your inspection.

648
00:37:09,815 --> 00:37:11,840
Exquisite.

649
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,288
Then our transaction
is complete.

650
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:18,688
Not quite.

651
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:20,885
l'll be taking them, too.

652
00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:22,393
They warned me about you!

653
00:37:22,428 --> 00:37:23,725
Not true!

654
00:37:23,762 --> 00:37:26,890
A deal is a deal--
Rule of Acquisition Number 16.

655
00:37:26,932 --> 00:37:28,058
Kot...

656
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,658
you got what you came for.

657
00:37:29,702 --> 00:37:30,999
Now let's be reasonable.

658
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,908
Pick it up.
Pick it up!

659
00:37:36,942 --> 00:37:38,102
Move!
Hurry up!

660
00:37:38,144 --> 00:37:40,510
Move! Move!

661
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:41,843
Let's go.

662
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:48,642
Priority-1 Security
to Level 22, Section 5.

663
00:37:56,428 --> 00:37:58,487
l'm sure Julian
would understand.

664
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:00,522
Besides, he can still
publish the results

665
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:02,295
from your first treatments.

666
00:38:03,669 --> 00:38:04,863
Both of you--
back in the ship.

667
00:38:04,904 --> 00:38:06,235
Let's go!

668
00:38:08,507 --> 00:38:09,804
Move it!

669
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,835
Come on, move it!

670
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:16,370
Now, get us out of here.

671
00:38:16,415 --> 00:38:17,541
He's already shot a man.

672
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:18,550
Do as he says.

673
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:19,710
l'll just wait in the back.

674
00:38:19,752 --> 00:38:21,276
ln the front,
where l can see you.

675
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,287
There-- hurry up.

676
00:38:22,321 --> 00:38:23,720
l'm moving as fast as l can!

677
00:38:23,756 --> 00:38:24,882
She's an Elaysian.

678
00:38:24,924 --> 00:38:27,654
She needs motor support
in our gravity.

679
00:38:29,595 --> 00:38:30,755
They're in the <i>Orinoco.</i>

680
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:33,890
Docking clamps have been
released, thrusters engaged.

681
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:36,231
Ready a tractor beam,
open a channel.

682
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:37,292
Open.

683
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:39,304
This is
Commander Benjamin Sisko.

684
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:41,602
Return to the station at once.

685
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,301
No reply.

686
00:38:43,342 --> 00:38:45,674
Engage the tractor beam.

687
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:50,514
They've locked onto us
with the tractor beam.

688
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:52,847
Open the channel
to that Commander of yours.

689
00:38:53,886 --> 00:38:56,320
Release this ship
or l'll kill a hostage.

690
00:38:56,355 --> 00:38:58,016
l'm willing to negotiate
your freedom

691
00:38:58,057 --> 00:38:59,922
but first release those...

692
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:01,925
Didn't you hear
what l just said?

693
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:07,856
No, l have something special
in mind for you.

694
00:39:18,143 --> 00:39:19,872
Do l make myself clear?

695
00:39:19,912 --> 00:39:23,109
Release the ship now.

696
00:39:23,148 --> 00:39:25,048
Doctor, Chief-- with me.

697
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:26,676
Beam us to the <i>Rio Grande.</i>

698
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:27,879
Give us ten seconds

699
00:39:27,987 --> 00:39:29,545
and then disengage
the tractor beam.

700
00:39:29,588 --> 00:39:30,919
Understood.

701
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:34,587
Energizing.

702
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,524
They've released us.

703
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:45,036
Through the wormhole.

704
00:40:06,557 --> 00:40:07,524
What was that?

705
00:40:07,558 --> 00:40:08,582
l'm not sure.

706
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:09,888
What was it?

707
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:12,623
Another ship coming
through the wormhole.

708
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:13,721
Take us to warp.

709
00:40:13,764 --> 00:40:16,130
We haven't even
set a course yet.

710
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:17,828
l don't care about the course,
just go to warp.

711
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:19,803
lf we don't set a course

712
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:22,806
we could warp ourselves
into oblivion.

713
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,501
Fine, set a course.

714
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:26,703
Just get us out of here.

715
00:40:26,744 --> 00:40:28,905
They're powering up
their warp drive.

716
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,072
Stay with them.

717
00:40:30,114 --> 00:40:31,843
Engaging warp engines.

718
00:40:31,883 --> 00:40:34,351
Can we beam them
aboard at warp?

719
00:40:34,385 --> 00:40:36,410
l wouldn't recommend that.

720
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:51,264
Get the phasers ready.

721
00:40:51,302 --> 00:40:53,736
l'm not going
to fire at them.

722
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:56,365
Oh, you'll do it or you'll die.

723
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:57,931
lt's your choice.

724
00:40:58,042 --> 00:41:00,272
Fine.

725
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:02,472
Then l hope
you can fly this ship.

726
00:41:02,513 --> 00:41:06,449
Just sit down
and do what l told you. Now.

727
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:10,753
Quark, how well
do you know this man?

728
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:14,019
We've been friends for years,
not counting today.

729
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:15,286
Well l suggest you
explain to him

730
00:41:15,326 --> 00:41:17,351
that Starfleet
isn't going to give up

731
00:41:17,395 --> 00:41:18,692
and stop chasing us.

732
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:19,753
That's true, Fallit.

733
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:21,765
You don't know
these Starfleet types.

734
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:23,664
Then we'll all die.

735
00:41:24,835 --> 00:41:27,030
Great, we escape and he's got

736
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:29,062
something ''special''
planned for me.

737
00:41:29,106 --> 00:41:30,403
We don't escape

738
00:41:30,441 --> 00:41:31,840
and l just die
with everyone else.

739
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:33,070
l'm l missing
a choice here, Fallit?

740
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,236
Be quiet, Quark.

741
00:41:45,022 --> 00:41:46,751
They've dropped out of warp.

742
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:47,815
Go to impulse.

743
00:41:47,858 --> 00:41:50,918
Sir, their gravity
generators are off.

744
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:52,554
Melora's alive.

745
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,360
Gravity's been reinstated.

746
00:41:54,398 --> 00:41:55,888
All engines are down.

747
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,400
Come on, Doctor.

748
00:42:09,814 --> 00:42:13,614
l think we have the situation
in hand, Commander.

749
00:42:13,651 --> 00:42:14,618
Sisko to <i>Rio Grande.</i>

750
00:42:14,652 --> 00:42:15,880
Everything's under control.

751
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,887
We're going home.

752
00:42:16,921 --> 00:42:18,218
Aye, Commander.

753
00:42:18,255 --> 00:42:20,280
Setting course for the wormhole.

754
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:29,625
Why didn't the phaser kill me?

755
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:30,895
Oh, l don't know.

756
00:42:30,935 --> 00:42:32,800
Maybe all the neurostimulants

757
00:42:32,837 --> 00:42:34,998
we've been pumping
into your body.

758
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:37,098
That's what l was
wondering, too.

759
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:38,403
You know, it might make

760
00:42:38,442 --> 00:42:40,842
an interesting side
effect to the treatment.

761
00:42:40,878 --> 00:42:42,311
lt's worth exploring...

762
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:47,374
Julian... l'm not going ahead
with the treatments.

763
00:42:47,418 --> 00:42:49,784
Well, you can always
try it again someday

764
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,515
if you change your mind.

765
00:42:51,555 --> 00:42:54,820
l don't think l will.

766
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:56,724
l like being independent.

767
00:42:56,761 --> 00:43:03,530
But to give up everything l am
to walk... on land...

768
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:05,660
well, l might be
more independent

769
00:43:05,703 --> 00:43:07,967
but l wouldn't
be Elaysian anymore.

770
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:10,565
l'm not sure what l'd be.

771
00:43:12,576 --> 00:43:15,841
Besides, maybe independence
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

772
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,347
l kind of like how it feels

773
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:19,542
to be dependent on someone
for a change.

774
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,608
And l'm glad you
got me to unlock

775
00:43:21,652 --> 00:43:23,142
the doors to my quarters

776
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:27,123
so l could finally let someone
into my life.

777
00:43:27,158 --> 00:43:28,819
So am l.

778
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:39,129
<i>Aler acht'jar,</i>
<i>Aler acht'jar</i>

779
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:46,872
<i>T'lembda boool-gah toh-gal</i>

780
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:55,250

782
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:00,314
Oh, you must be exhausted.

783
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:02,222
Uh, if you don't want to stay...

784
00:44:02,259 --> 00:44:04,955
No, let's just sit
a while and listen.

785
00:44:04,995 --> 00:44:11,195
<i>Rom ara Rom Rom-rom</i>

786
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:17,538
<i>T'el Do'a, Do'a...</i>

787
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:21,136
l want to remember all of this.

788
00:44:21,178 --> 00:44:23,439
<i>Rom ara Rom Rom-rom...</i>

789
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:27,205
<i>Rom ara Rom Rom-rom...</i>
