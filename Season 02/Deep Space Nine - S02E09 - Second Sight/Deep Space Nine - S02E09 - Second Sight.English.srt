1
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:08,695
Personal Log, Stardate 47329.4.

2
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:11,601
l finally realized
why l've had trouble sleeping

3
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,298
the last few nights.

4
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:15,636
Yesterday was
the fourth anniversary

5
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:17,642
of the massacre at Wolf 359...

6
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:21,134
the fourth anniversary
of Jennifer's death.

7
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,272
l'm not sure
what bothers me more--

8
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,748
the date itself

9
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:27,752
or the fact that it almost
passed unnoticed.

10
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,649
Dad, what are you doing up?

11
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:38,857
l was about to ask you
the same thing.

12
00:00:38,897 --> 00:00:41,024
l-l had a weird dream.

13
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,933
Get some hot chocolate
and tell me about it.

14
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:47,166
Nah, it's nothing.

15
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:49,070
Ah, come on.

16
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:52,201
Tell me about this weird dream.

17
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:53,608
lt's stupid.

18
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:55,203
Maybe so.

19
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:57,875
But the thing about dreams is

20
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,646
if you talk about them,
they kind of go away faster.

21
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,154
Okay, but don't laugh.

22
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:04,415
l promise.

23
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:09,151
l don't know, l was...

24
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,857
l was on the station somewhere--

25
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:15,264
l'm not sure where--

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,700
and l was trying
to get back here

27
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:20,762
but l couldn't...
l couldn't find my way.

28
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:24,298
l mean, every time l saw
a familiar corridor

29
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:27,744
it kind of led
into some other direction.

30
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:30,111
See, l told you it was stupid.

31
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:31,877
You got me interested.

32
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,681
Well, then...

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,384
l guess l got a little scared
and started looking for you.

34
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:42,416
But l couldn't find you.

35
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:44,895
Some... Somehow
l ended up in Ops

36
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,454
but you weren't in your...

37
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:48,090
you weren't in your office.

38
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,931
And... and then it was like...

39
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:53,631
like the floor started sloping

40
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:56,163
and... and l couldn't
keep my balance.

41
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,768
And all l wanted to do
was find you.

42
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,875
And here l am.

43
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,049
Dad, l... l love you.

44
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,679
l love you, too.

45
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:18,328
Oh, l have a calculus test
in the morning.

46
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:20,456
Then you better get some sleep.

47
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:22,126
Yeah.

48
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:28,164
Dad?

49
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,002
Hmm?

50
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,702
l miss her.

51
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:34,840
Me, too.

52
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:12,440
Beautiful, aren't they?

53
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,220
l don't think l've seen
the stars shine so brightly.

54
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,960
The Bajorans call
that constellation

55
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,518
''the Runners.''

56
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,428
l can never figure out

57
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:29,434
if they're running
toward something

58
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:31,459
or away from something.

59
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,937
Does that matter?

60
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:37,430
Sometimes it just
feels good to run.

61
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:40,070
l never thought about it
that way.

62
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:47,609
l'm Benjamin Sisko,
Commander of this station.

63
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:49,745
l'm...

64
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:51,653
Fenna.

65
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:56,322
l'm sorry,
you must be very busy.

66
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,352
l didn't mean to bother you.

67
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:00,762
You're not bothering me
at all.

68
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,164
Good.

69
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,798
Commander of the station.

70
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:07,862
That must be very exciting--

71
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:10,340
all those ships
coming and going.

72
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,935
Every day must bring
something new.

73
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:15,708
lt has its moments.

74
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:19,774
ln some ways, though,
l prefer this time the best

75
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:22,787
when everything is quiet and...

76
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:26,018
And you can feel a kind
of anticipation in the air

77
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,150
like something wonderful
is going to happen

78
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:30,320
but you just don't know
what it is.

79
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,832
l guess that sounds
kind of silly, doesn't it?

80
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:36,163
Not at all.

81
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:39,135
That's one of the great things
about this station.

82
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,730
You never know
what's going to happen next.

83
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:47,171
Or who you're going to meet.

84
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,611
l like it here.

85
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:54,042
l wish l could stay longer.

86
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,985
Where are you going?

87
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,516
l'm not really sure.

88
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:06,493
l guess l'll just keep going,
like the Runners.

89
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,829
l tell you what.

90
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:12,962
Before you run any farther

91
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:15,495
why don't l show you
around the station

92
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,098
if you have the time...?

93
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,640
Fenna?

94
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,090
Good morning, Chief.

95
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:36,318
Morning, Commander.

96
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:38,088
ls this maintenance or repair?

97
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:39,754
Right now, it's maintenance.

98
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:42,424
Five'll get you ten, it'll be a
repair by the time l'm through.

99
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:43,727
Admit it, Chief.

100
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:46,291
lf you were on a station
where everything worked

101
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:47,302
you'd be miserable.

102
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:48,564
Well, you may be right, sir.

103
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,968
But l'd be willing
to give it a try.

104
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:54,476
Good morning, Major.

105
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,341
Computer, one Chiraltan tea

106
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,404
with a double twist of lemon.

107
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:15,297
Something wrong?

108
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:16,764
No, nothing.

109
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,323
lf something's
bothering you, Major

110
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,425
l want to hear it.

111
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:20,493
lt's just that...

112
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:22,163
Every morning
for the last year

113
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:23,570
l've seen you walk in here

114
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,506
and start your day
with a <i>raktajino.</i>

115
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,508
l love <i>raktajino.</i>

116
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:27,531
l know.
You never even talk

117
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:29,841
to anyone until you've had
your first cup.

118
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,507
Because l'm not awake
until l've had my first cup.

119
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:33,845
So...

120
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:36,750
how come you're drinking
Chiraltan tea?

121
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:41,753
l, uh...

122
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,420
l just felt like
having something different.

123
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,292
That is all right with you,
isn't it, Major?

124
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,924
Of course.
You can drink whatever you like.

125
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:50,990
Thank you, Major.

126
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,763
l appreciate your support.

127
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:55,202
Dax to Sisko.

128
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:56,535
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

129
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:58,733
Professor Seyetik
and l are in the Science Lab

130
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,037
if you'd like to meet him.

131
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:01,270
On my way.

132
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:08,910
Lieutenant, where's our guest?

133
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:10,384
lnside the flux generator.

134
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,943
What?
What's he doing in there?

135
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:13,046
He could be killed.

136
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:14,851
Well, that's what
l tried to tell him.

137
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:16,791
And he went in anyway.

138
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:18,760
Benjamin, have you ever
met a terraformer?

139
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:20,194
No, what's that
got to do with it?

140
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:22,424
You can't tell
a terraformer anything.

141
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:23,796
lt's an amazing talent--

142
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,494
bringing dead worlds to life

143
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,264
but humility and common sense

144
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:29,430
aren't part
of the job description.

145
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:31,167
Oh.

146
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:47,513
There you go, Lieutenant.

147
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:49,286
That should increase

148
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:52,317
your generator output
by at least five percent.

149
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:54,591
Ah, you must be Commander Sisko.

150
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,688
Gideon Seyetik.

151
00:09:55,731 --> 00:09:57,096
Great pleasure to meet you, sir.

152
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:58,100
Professor.

153
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,601
l'm a great admirer
of your work.

154
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:02,103
Good, a man
of intelligence and taste.

155
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:04,537
l can see we're going
to get along famously.

156
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:09,067
My son and l visited
Blue Horizon

157
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:10,408
on the way to Deep Space 9.

158
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:12,107
l must say, l was impressed.

159
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:13,443
Of course you were.

160
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:16,417
l created the place,
and even l'm impressed.

161
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:18,113
How did you like DaVinci Falls?

162
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:19,484
We didn't get to see them.

163
00:10:19,522 --> 00:10:21,217
We were on the surface
only for a few hours.

164
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:26,661
Oh, Commander, you missed
Blue Horizon's crowning glory.

165
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:28,687
lmagine water cascading

166
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:31,131
off cliffs the height
of Mount Everest

167
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:34,692
thundering through
continuous rainbows

168
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:37,865
straight into an ocean
the color of sapphire wine.

169
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:39,340
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

170
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,605
l'm going to have
to take you there one day.

171
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:43,805
By God, l wouldn't mind
seeing it again myself.

172
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:45,780
l may take you up on that.

173
00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:47,077
Good, good.

174
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:50,483
But first, Epsilon 1 19, huh?

175
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,511
Yes, l understand the initial
surveys look promising.

176
00:10:53,556 --> 00:10:54,523
Promising?

177
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:56,024
Why, they look magnificent!

178
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:58,856
lmagine, reigniting a dead sun

179
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:03,730
bringing new life
to an entire solar system.

180
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:05,233
Next to that,
terraforming planets

181
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:07,202
will seem like child's play.

182
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:08,533
Let's hope it works.

183
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:10,835
Right now,
it's a promising theory.

184
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:13,068
Of course it'll work.

185
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:14,474
l never fail.

186
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,307
Well, l did once.

187
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:18,745
But l found it didn't
agree with me, so l swore

188
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:21,306
never to do it again,
and l never break my word.

189
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:25,921
Oh, you should be glad you're
coming with me, Lieutenant.

190
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:27,946
This'll be
my crowning achievement.

191
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,118
Giving birth to a star.

192
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:34,287
Even l would have a hard time
topping that one.

193
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,601
You're not going to let
that last piece

194
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:46,011
of Andorian tuber root
go to waste, are you?

195
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,105
Why do you ask?

196
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:48,512
Because it's delicious.

197
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:49,709
May l?

198
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,275
Be my guest.

199
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,651
l'm going to need
the extra calories

200
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:55,212
to keep up with Seyetik.

201
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,986
The man works almost
as much as he talks.

202
00:11:58,026 --> 00:11:58,993
Benjamin?

203
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:00,517
What?

204
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:02,620
Are you looking for someone?

205
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:05,155
l'm sorry, what were you saying?

206
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,064
Uh, nothing important.

207
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,899
l have to meet
with Chief O'Brien.

208
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,701
We are boosting
the maximum speed

209
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,300
of Seyetik's ship to warp 9.5.

210
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:18,744
lf his experiment fails
and that sun goes supernova

211
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,772
we're going to need
to get out of there fast.

212
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:23,545
l'll see you in Ops.

213
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:49,741
Benjamin...

214
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:52,610
l was hoping l'd see you again.

215
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,013
l was just thinking about you.

216
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,380
Were you really?

217
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:58,749
l've been thinking about you,
too.

218
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:01,414
Where did you
disappear to last night?

219
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:02,821
l had to go, l'm sorry.

220
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:05,189
l didn't mean
to rush away like that.

221
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:07,285
Does your invitation
still stand?

222
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,558
To show me around the station?

223
00:13:09,597 --> 00:13:12,065
What would you like to see?

224
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,294
Everything.

225
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,893
Everything?

226
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:19,368
That's going to take some time.

227
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:22,103
l don't mind if you don't.

228
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:33,113
What do you think?

229
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:35,920
lt's wonderful.

230
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:37,481
l'm glad you like it.

231
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,322
You must come here all the time.

232
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,827
Not really, but when l do

233
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,558
a ship is usually
blocking the view.

234
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:45,725
We should have brought
a picnic basket.

235
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,200
Here?

236
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:49,260
What better place?

237
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:54,072
Well, l guess there is tomorrow.

238
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:55,803
ls that an invitation?

239
00:13:57,812 --> 00:13:59,837
Sounded like one to me.

240
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:02,575
Then l accept.

241
00:14:02,617 --> 00:14:04,778
Good.

242
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,714
There's plenty left to see.

243
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:10,781
ln fact, l doubt that we can
see it all in one evening.

244
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:14,158
Then you can show me the rest
after our picnic tomorrow.

245
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:17,163
Do you always do that?

246
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:18,392
Do what?

247
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:21,230
Say exactly the right thing.

248
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:26,500
Well, no one's ever
told me that before.

249
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,872
There you go again.

250
00:14:29,844 --> 00:14:31,539
So...

251
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:35,338
tell me all about yourself.

252
00:14:37,652 --> 00:14:39,279
There's not much to tell.

253
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,515
Whatever there is,
l want to hear it.

254
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:44,052
l can't.

255
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,422
Can't what?

256
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:48,290
l can't tell you.

257
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:49,990
Why not?

258
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,192
l'm sorry, Benjamin,
but l have to go.

259
00:14:56,838 --> 00:14:58,669
Fenna, wait.

260
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:15,178
So, then Tiet looked
down at Altrina's lunch

261
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:16,451
and said, ''Klingon food?

262
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,787
Those are worms!''

263
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:19,918
And Altrina vomited
all over the table!

264
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:25,491
lt was pretty disgusting.

265
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,057
That's nice, Jake.

266
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,897
Nice?
She threw up!

267
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:31,062
Hmm?

268
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,299
Oh, l'm sorry.

269
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,434
l guess l must have been
thinking about something else.

270
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:38,640
Dad...

271
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,771
are you in love?

272
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,543
What?

273
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:43,049
You know, with a woman?

274
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:45,518
You're showing
all three of the signs.

275
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:46,542
Signs?

276
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:48,851
The ones that Nog
told me about:

277
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,452
Loss of appetite, daydreaming,
smiling all the time.

278
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,463
You've been talking to Nog
about women again?

279
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,934
Look, l just want you to know
that if you're in love

280
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:03,027
it's all right with me.

281
00:16:07,108 --> 00:16:08,405
Thanks, Jake.

282
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:11,002
What's she like?

283
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,844
She's, uh... really interesting.

284
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:19,280
lnteresting, huh?

285
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,584
So, when do l get to meet her?

286
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:24,989
l think it might be
a little early to do that.

287
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,051
Why? She likes you, too,
doesn't she?

288
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:28,925
l think so.

289
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:32,364
So, then what's the problem?

290
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:38,298
Well, um...

291
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:41,941
it's just that, uh...

292
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:46,673
she keeps disappearing.

293
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,245
Above all, stay alert.

294
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:58,053
lf the subspace transmission
l've received is correct

295
00:16:58,092 --> 00:17:00,287
and Villus Thed is
en route to the station

296
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:02,626
l want to be notified
the moment he arrives.

297
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:04,324
Keep him under
constant surveillance

298
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:06,299
but remember,
he's a short-range telepath

299
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:09,030
so stay at least five meters
away from him at all times.

300
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,264
That's all.

301
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:12,295
Yes, sir.

302
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,003
Commander,
what can l do for you?

303
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:20,842
l need to ask
a favor, Constable.

304
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:22,712
Of a personal nature.

305
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,047
Go on.

306
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,248
l'm looking for someone--
a woman.

307
00:17:28,389 --> 00:17:29,481
Name?

308
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:30,615
Fenna.

309
00:17:31,826 --> 00:17:33,623
First name or last?

310
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:35,424
l don't know.

311
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:36,930
Species?

312
00:17:36,964 --> 00:17:38,261
l don't know.

313
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:39,630
Humanoid.

314
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:42,795
What ship did she arrive on?

315
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:45,516
l... don't know.

316
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:48,248
Well...

317
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:51,482
what can you tell me about her?

318
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:52,989
Let's see...

319
00:17:53,023 --> 00:17:56,686
l'd say she's
about 1.6 meters tall...

320
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,922
brown skin...

321
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:00,954
dark hair.

322
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:04,934
The last time l saw her,
she was wearing a...

323
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:09,731
She was wearing red.

324
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,674
Well, that's something, anyway.

325
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:16,475
Do you think you can help me?

326
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,981
l don't know.

327
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,745
l need to find her, Constable.

328
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:22,615
l think she may be
in some kind of trouble.

329
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:23,915
What kind of trouble?

330
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:26,354
Oh... let me guess.

331
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,324
You don't know.

332
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,994
Well, it's not much to go on,
but l'll do what l can.

333
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,261
l appreciate your help, Odo.

334
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:53,145
Benjamin, do you have a minute?

335
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:54,241
ln my office.

336
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:04,723
What's on your mind, Dax?

337
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:07,060
l was hoping you had
something to say to me.

338
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:08,758
l don't follow you.

339
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,131
You really have no intention
of telling me, do you?

340
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:12,465
Telling you what?

341
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:13,697
Come on, Benjamin!

342
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,138
l saw you with her last night
on the Promenade.

343
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:18,835
What's her name?

344
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:21,973
Fenna.

345
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,445
But believe me, Dax,
there is nothing to talk about.

346
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:26,472
You used to tell Curzon
everything.

347
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:28,246
Not everything.

348
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:29,650
You know what l mean.

349
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:32,247
lt's because l'm
a woman now, isn't it?

350
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:34,689
Don't be ridiculous!

351
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:35,885
No, l understand.

352
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,451
lt's hard to talk
man-to-man with a woman.

353
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:40,429
That has nothing to do with it.

354
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:43,433
Then tell me what's going on.

355
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:44,934
l will.

356
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:48,335
As soon as there is
something to tell.

357
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,573
Personal Log, supplemental.

358
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,273
Odo continues to search for
new information about Fenna.

359
00:19:57,314 --> 00:20:00,681
ln the meantime, Professor
Seyetik has invited me

360
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:04,415
and the senior staff to dinner
aboard the <i>Prometheus.</i>

361
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:09,154
A great terraformer needs
the green thumb of a gardener

362
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:12,959
the eye of a painter
and the soul of a poet.

363
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:16,261
And of course, it doesn't hurt
to be a raging egomaniac.

364
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,600
Which makes you
eminently qualified.

365
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,161
Of course!

366
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:26,767
Terraforming is amazing enough,
but l don't understand

367
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,937
how you intend
to reignite a dead sun.

368
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:32,278
Basically, l'll use
a remote piloted shuttlepod

369
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,410
to deliver protomatter
into the dead star.

370
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:37,784
This will cause a cascade effect

371
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:41,348
which will transform
the star's carbon and oxygen

372
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:43,154
into elemental hydrogen.

373
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:46,629
And then we just stand back
and watch the fireworks.

374
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,994
Of course, if it doesn't work

375
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:49,862
it might be the last thing
we ever see.

376
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,958
Oh, come now, Lieutenant.

377
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,731
Nothing of worth
was ever created by a pessimist.

378
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:55,204
l don't know about that.

379
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:56,866
Van Gogh, Beckett, Y'Raka--

380
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,841
l wouldn't exactly
call them optimists.

381
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:00,901
Precisely,
and look at their work--

382
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:03,412
dark and dreary and dismal.

383
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:06,814
Art should be
an affirmation of life.

384
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,546
For example, take my own work
in the field.

385
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:13,181
l once saw an exhibit
of your paintings

386
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:16,715
at the Central Gallery
on Ligobis X.

387
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,524
They certainly were memorable.

388
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:22,589
l don't think l've ever
seen such huge canvases.

389
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:26,797
Doctor, nobody ever accused me
of understatement.

390
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:27,804
Certainly not anyone

391
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:28,998
who's ever read
your autobiography.

392
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,529
Nine volumes and counting.

393
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:35,240
You know, l always said
l wanted to write as many books

394
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,042
as l've had marriages.

395
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:38,979
Ah... which reminds me.

396
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:43,680
Wait till you taste the food
my wife has created for you.

397
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,178
None of that replicated nonsense
you're used to.

398
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:48,714
No, no, no.

399
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:53,389
Every dish was prepared entirely
by Nidell's own sweet hands.

400
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,591
l can't wait to meet her.

401
00:21:55,632 --> 00:21:56,724
And so you shall.

402
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:58,428
She should be just about ready.

403
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:00,800
l'll go and get her.

404
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:04,331
Commander, do you think
he'd notice

405
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:06,001
if we weren't here
when he got back?

406
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,634
Don't even think
about it, Major.

407
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:10,374
l've had dinner with about
two dozen Bajoran ministers.

408
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,779
l think you owe me this one.

409
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:15,774
Besides, Seyetik is one of
the Federation's greatest minds.

410
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:17,582
l know, he told me.

411
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:21,387
Well, l, for one, find him
remarkably entertaining.

412
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:23,926
Ladies and gentlemen

413
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:28,364
l'd like you to meet my wife
and my inspiration... Nidell.

414
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:38,875
Now we have something
to talk about.

415
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,516
l can't eat another bite.

416
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:49,280
That was delicious.

417
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,048
Do you think
l could have the recipe?

418
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:53,352
You'll have to ask Gideon.

419
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,221
lt's his creation.

420
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,717
Well, it took me years
to perfect it.

421
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:01,697
The secret, you see, is to sear

422
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:03,927
the Kalo roots slightly
before layering them

423
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,798
over the slices
of roasted Waroon.

424
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:07,963
But the most important...

425
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:10,269
She acts like
she doesn't recognize me.

426
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,434
...one liter
of clear Rumall stock...

427
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,273
lt is the same woman, isn't it?

428
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,006
She looks the same.

429
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,603
...of Vulcan redspice

430
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,173
half a dozen Humat pods
and a dash of ice salt.

431
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:23,152
And then you reduce it
in an Andorian boiler

432
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:26,019
cook it exactly
500 degrees Kelvin

433
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:29,092
and then you just
pepper to taste.

434
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,962
Any questions?

435
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,554
Ah, maybe you should
write that down.

436
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:37,358
Of course.

437
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:39,631
No trouble at all.

438
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,798
Well... l think we should
continue this conversation

439
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,033
in the other room.

440
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:47,133
We shall be
more comfortable there.

441
00:23:57,988 --> 00:24:00,957
Commander, can l help
you with something?

442
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:02,982
l hope so.

443
00:24:04,394 --> 00:24:06,521
lt would have been a lot easier

444
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:08,929
if you'd told me
you were married.

445
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:10,957
l don't understand.

446
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:12,195
Yesterday...

447
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:13,668
on the Promenade...

448
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:16,002
you had plenty of opportunity.

449
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:19,167
Commander, l don't know
what you're talking about.

450
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:21,336
l've never met you
before tonight.

451
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:29,243
l suppose you never told me
that your name was Fenna.

452
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:37,323
Would you like
to talk about this?

453
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:39,921
Commander, obviously
you have mistaken me

454
00:24:39,963 --> 00:24:41,362
for someone else.

455
00:24:47,037 --> 00:24:49,505
Seems that way...

456
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,632
doesn't it?

457
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,670
l'm telling you, Dax,
it was the same woman.

458
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,074
The face, the voice--
it was Fenna.

459
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:06,739
Maybe you have to talk to her
when her husband isn't around.

460
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,475
Dax, she's a married woman.

461
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:10,847
That would have never
stopped Curzon.

462
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,149
lt's just that this
was the first time

463
00:25:14,188 --> 00:25:18,750
since Jennifer's death that
l felt... drawn to someone.

464
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,987
Commander, may l have
a word with you?

465
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,325
l thought you should know

466
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:28,425
l've checked this week's
docking and transporter logs

467
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:30,197
and there is no record

468
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,263
of anyone matching
the description you gave me.

469
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:34,706
Thanks, Odo.

470
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,971
But you can call off
your search.

471
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,978
l've already found
the woman l was looking for.

472
00:25:39,046 --> 00:25:40,479
You did?

473
00:25:40,514 --> 00:25:43,881
And where was she,
if you don't mind my asking?

474
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,612
Aboard the <i>Prometheus.</i>

475
00:25:45,652 --> 00:25:46,983
The <i>Prometheus?</i>

476
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,315
Are you sure?

477
00:25:48,355 --> 00:25:50,323
Yes, we just left there
a few minutes ago.

478
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:51,790
That's impossible.

479
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,224
What do you mean?

480
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,991
l checked the de-embarkation
logs as part of my search.

481
00:25:57,064 --> 00:25:59,760
With the exception
of Professor Seyetik

482
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,927
no one has left the <i>Prometheus</i>

483
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:05,268
during the entire time
it's been at the station.

484
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,414
Commander...

485
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,609
l thought you could use this.

486
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,948
No thanks, l was just leaving.

487
00:26:18,986 --> 00:26:21,352
Stood you up, didn't she?

488
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:24,084
When you've worked
in a bar as long as l have

489
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,955
you get to recognize that look.

490
00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:28,757
l've even seen it
in the mirror once or twice.

491
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,888
l'd better be getting home.

492
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:32,091
lf you like

493
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,295
we could go down to the bar
and talk...

494
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:37,200
you know, about women.

495
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:39,296
l don't think so.

496
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,701
Don't forget...

497
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:47,043
the holosuites are always open.

498
00:27:01,795 --> 00:27:03,092
Benjamin!

499
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,591
l missed you.

500
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:14,130
ls there something wrong?

501
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,300
l just had dinner

502
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,004
with someone who looks
exactly like you.

503
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:20,845
Like me?

504
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,314
How strange.

505
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,453
You're telling me that your name
isn't really Nidell

506
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:32,583
and you're not the wife
of Gideon Seyetik?

507
00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:33,957
Of course not.

508
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:35,961
l'm Fenna.
You know that.

509
00:27:36,063 --> 00:27:38,896
Right now, l'm not
sure what l know.

510
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:44,160
l don't suppose you have
a twin sister, do you?

511
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,600
Not that l know of.

512
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:49,741
Fenna...

513
00:27:49,776 --> 00:27:52,802
l need to know
where you came from

514
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:55,406
and what you're doing
on this station.

515
00:27:55,449 --> 00:27:57,576
Does that matter?

516
00:27:59,586 --> 00:28:01,952
Of course it matters.

517
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,092
l need to know who you are.

518
00:28:16,703 --> 00:28:18,694
You do know me, Benjamin.

519
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,175
When l came here,
l thought l was looking

520
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:24,200
for a place--

521
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,577
somewhere l belonged--
but l was wrong.

522
00:28:27,614 --> 00:28:33,177
l wasn't looking for a place;
l was looking for a person.

523
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,120
l was looking for you.

524
00:29:01,648 --> 00:29:03,479
Benjamin...

525
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:24,128
All right, Lieutenant.

526
00:29:24,171 --> 00:29:26,196
l've got the warp drive
on the <i>Prometheus</i>

527
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,365
purring like a kitten.

528
00:29:27,407 --> 00:29:28,601
lt'll do 9.6 in a pinch

529
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,405
but l wouldn't take it
any faster.

530
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:32,241
l thought
the theoretical maximum

531
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,940
for those engines was warp 9.5.

532
00:29:34,014 --> 00:29:35,413
Well, it was.

533
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:37,041
Must l remind you, Lieutenant

534
00:29:37,084 --> 00:29:39,712
some of us have
only one lifetime?

535
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:41,380
l'll be right there.

536
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,681
Good luck, Lieutenant.

537
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:47,784
Commander.

538
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,659
Come to see us off, Benjamin?

539
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,721
Not exactly--
l'm going with you.

540
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:54,962
How often do you get a chance
to see a star reborn?

541
00:29:55,068 --> 00:29:57,229
Do you really think
this is a good idea?

542
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,635
l need answers, Dax.

543
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,140
And the key
to Fenna's disappearance

544
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,607
may be on that ship.

545
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:17,983
Have you finished loading

546
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,992
the protomatter device
into the shuttle pod?

547
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:21,424
All set.

548
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:23,190
The containment fields
are holding fine.

549
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,289
Remote guidance systems
are fully operational.

550
00:30:25,332 --> 00:30:27,095
l'm telling you, Commander

551
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:29,602
by the time l was through
with New Halana

552
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:31,297
it was a veritable paradise.

553
00:30:31,338 --> 00:30:33,188
How are we doing, Mr. Piersall?

554
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:35,812
We'll be initiating preliminary
scans in a few hours.

555
00:30:35,857 --> 00:30:38,121
Well, let me know
when we get there.

556
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,492
Well, Professor, you must
be eager to get started.

557
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:42,962
What did you call this?

558
00:30:42,998 --> 00:30:44,659
Your crowning achievement.

559
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:46,496
Ah, don't remind me.

560
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:48,832
Commander, my entire life

561
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:52,601
has been a series
of escalating triumphs.

562
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:54,268
lt's what l live for...

563
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:56,004
knowing that no matter
what l achieve

564
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:58,375
there's always another
triumph waiting for me.

565
00:30:58,413 --> 00:30:59,937
And now?

566
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:01,414
Well...

567
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:05,943
Are you familiar
with the Klingon poet G'Trok?

568
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:07,181
A little.

569
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:09,952
<i>The Fall of Kang</i> is required
reading at the Academy.

570
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:10,980
Ah...

571
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:13,324
''So honor the valiant

572
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:15,158
who die 'neath
your sword...''

573
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:18,131
''But pity the warrior
who slays all his foes.''

574
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,463
Well...

575
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:21,492
yes, well...

576
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:25,870
a bit obvious perhaps,
but true nonetheless.

577
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:29,971
So, what were we talking about?

578
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:30,977
You.

579
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,103
Hah! Of course.

580
00:31:32,147 --> 00:31:33,341
My favorite subject.

581
00:31:33,381 --> 00:31:34,609
Where was l?

582
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:36,981
You had just finished
terraforming New Halana.

583
00:31:37,052 --> 00:31:38,246
Ah, of course.

584
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:39,378
Well, you can imagine

585
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:41,286
how grateful
the New Halanans were.

586
00:31:41,323 --> 00:31:45,521
Endless parades
and receptions and...

587
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,654
Got to be a bit of a bore,
actually.

588
00:31:48,697 --> 00:31:51,495
But then l... l met Nidell.

589
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:54,195
She was the daughter
of a local dignitary

590
00:31:54,235 --> 00:31:58,194
and she was utterly infatuated
with me from the very start.

591
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:00,935
Well, l-l can't say
l blame her, actually.

592
00:32:00,975 --> 00:32:02,602
The first time she saw me

593
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:05,078
l was surrounded
by crowds of people

594
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:07,206
unveiling a statue
they'd commissioned

595
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:09,580
in my, in my honor.

596
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:13,451
Well, l could...
l could tell from the start

597
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:15,820
she was something special.

598
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:17,791
You know,
she'd never been off-world

599
00:32:17,826 --> 00:32:19,953
before she met me.

600
00:32:19,994 --> 00:32:23,225
l promised to show her
the galaxy.

601
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:27,132
l would have given it to her
if l could have.

602
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:30,160
She must love you very much.

603
00:32:30,205 --> 00:32:32,730
She does, Commander.

604
00:32:34,642 --> 00:32:37,941
Don't ask me why, but...

605
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:40,846
she does.

606
00:32:53,795 --> 00:32:54,989
Fenna?

607
00:32:55,096 --> 00:32:58,088
Benjamin, l'm so glad
to see you.

608
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:03,059
Dax, report to my quarters
immediately.

609
00:33:03,104 --> 00:33:04,401
On my way.

610
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:06,270
Benjamin, what's wrong?

611
00:33:06,307 --> 00:33:09,242
The last time l saw you...

612
00:33:09,277 --> 00:33:10,938
you vanished.

613
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:14,446
l'm with you now, and l'm never
going to leave you again.

614
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:17,610
l wish l could believe that.

615
00:33:21,823 --> 00:33:23,586
You have to, Benjamin.

616
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:27,992
Dax, this is Fenna.

617
00:33:30,198 --> 00:33:31,563
What is she doing?

618
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,930
lt's all right.

619
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:34,298
She's not going to hurt you.

620
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:38,868
l'm not reading
any cellular structure.

621
00:33:38,907 --> 00:33:40,374
No DNA patterns.

622
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:44,344
Just pure energy.

623
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:47,439
Benjamin, what is
she talking about?

624
00:33:47,482 --> 00:33:50,576
l think it's time we find out.

625
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,527
Help her.
She won't wake up.

626
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:13,506
She's in shock.

627
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:15,372
Her respiration is shallow.

628
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:18,072
Her heartbeat
is irregular and falling.

629
00:34:18,112 --> 00:34:20,205
Her blood pressure's dropping.

630
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:21,647
Benjamin, she's dying.

631
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:23,583
But you've got to do something!

632
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:25,711
l don't know that l can.

633
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,186
Fenna!

634
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:31,522
l should have known.

635
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,725
But you can't be here!

636
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,100
Nidell promised me
you'd never come back.

637
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:46,663
l don't know
what you're talking about.

638
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,300
Just look at her!

639
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:07,293
She looks like me.

640
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:08,761
Of course she looks like you!

641
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:10,593
She is you-- the real you.

642
00:35:10,632 --> 00:35:13,066
Professor,
what the hell is going on here?

643
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:15,661
That thing over there
isn't real.

644
00:35:15,703 --> 00:35:17,102
She's an illusion

645
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:20,130
created by my wife's
unconscious mind.

646
00:35:20,174 --> 00:35:21,232
That's not true!

647
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:23,506
Benjamin, you know
that he's lying.

648
00:35:23,545 --> 00:35:26,412
Nidell is
a psychoprojective telepath.

649
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:29,848
Fenna's just another one
of her projections.

650
00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:31,215
Lieutenant?

651
00:35:31,252 --> 00:35:33,482
l've never seen readings
like these.

652
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:37,048
Her occipital lobe is giving off
enormous amounts of energy.

653
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:39,218
l don't see
how she could survive

654
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,955
more than an hour or two
like this.

655
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:42,051
But she's dying!

656
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:43,324
You've got to do something!

657
00:35:43,364 --> 00:35:45,559
There's nothing l can do.

658
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:47,962
Get Fenna to my quarters, Dax.

659
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:49,060
And notify Lieutenant...

660
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:50,536
No!

661
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,764
Get her out of here, Dax.

662
00:35:53,808 --> 00:35:55,435
Benjamin, l want
to stay with you.

663
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:56,841
lt will be all right, Fenna.

664
00:35:56,878 --> 00:35:59,244
l just need to talk
to Professor Seyetik, here.

665
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:03,909
All right, Professor,
if what you're saying is true

666
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:07,251
Nidell's psychoprojective
abilities are killing her

667
00:36:07,288 --> 00:36:08,812
and l need to know why.

668
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:26,436
Nidell doesn't even
know this is happening.

669
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:31,244
ln times of deep
emotional distress

670
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,076
Halanans sometimes...

671
00:36:33,114 --> 00:36:35,912
lose control of these abilities.

672
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,248
My wife is very...

673
00:36:38,286 --> 00:36:40,754
emotionally distraught.

674
00:36:40,887 --> 00:36:46,291
Oh, this happened once before,
three years ago on Terosa Prime.

675
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:49,955
lt nearly killed her then.

676
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:53,830
She swore to me
it would never happen again.

677
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:55,095
Obviously...

678
00:36:56,837 --> 00:36:59,397
it has.

679
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:04,836
You may have noticed, Commander,
that l tend to evoke

680
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:09,247
strong emotions from people,
particularly my wives.

681
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:13,651
Oh, they all start out
loving me, but...

682
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:17,487
a few years of togetherness
soon cure them of that.

683
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,056
The others all had
the good sense to leave me.

684
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:26,559
But why can't Nidell?

685
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,932
What keeps her with you?

686
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:32,870
Halanans mate for life.

687
00:37:34,941 --> 00:37:36,704
She can never leave me

688
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:40,235
no matter how much
she might want to.

689
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:55,820
Benjamin, l've never seen
Seyetik or that woman before.

690
00:37:55,862 --> 00:37:57,386
l don't know why he's saying

691
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,728
those things about me,
but they're lies.

692
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:02,030
l'm as real as you are.

693
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:04,559
Oh, how l want to believe that.

694
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:07,266
But can you tell me
where you came from?

695
00:38:07,307 --> 00:38:09,138
How you got to this station?

696
00:38:09,175 --> 00:38:12,303
Can you tell me
a single memory of your life

697
00:38:12,345 --> 00:38:15,405
before we met on the Promenade?

698
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:23,586
Benjamin, l'm so frightened.

699
00:38:25,058 --> 00:38:27,026
Nidell's dying, Fenna.

700
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,392
She only has a few hours.

701
00:38:31,965 --> 00:38:35,059
What happens to me if she dies?

702
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:38,036
You no longer exist without her.

703
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:40,062
But you can save her.

704
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:43,701
Give her back the life
she gave to you.

705
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:46,535
l don't know how.

706
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:48,570
You can go back to her.

707
00:38:48,615 --> 00:38:51,982
l've seen you do it,
three times.

708
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,151
But even if she lives,
then l die

709
00:38:59,192 --> 00:39:02,628
and everything that you
and l have dies with me.

710
00:39:02,662 --> 00:39:04,926
Fenna...

711
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:11,327
what we have is a dream.

712
00:39:11,371 --> 00:39:15,171
l wouldn't trade it
for anything

713
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:18,644
but it's still just a dream--

714
00:39:18,678 --> 00:39:20,771
Nidell's dream.

715
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:24,045
And she won't remember
any of it, will she?

716
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:27,281
There's no way to be sure.

717
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:31,820
l love you, Benjamin

718
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:34,088
and l always will.

719
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,691
Commander, you'd better come
to the Bridge right away.

720
00:39:46,206 --> 00:39:47,173
What is it?

721
00:39:47,207 --> 00:39:48,674
lt's Seyetik.

722
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:51,472
He's launched the shuttlepod
toward Epsilon 1 19

723
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:52,739
and he's onboard.

724
00:39:52,779 --> 00:39:54,542
On my way.

725
00:39:58,385 --> 00:39:59,613
He's opening a channel.

726
00:39:59,652 --> 00:40:00,676
On screen.

727
00:40:01,755 --> 00:40:03,484
l hope this transmitter
is working.

728
00:40:03,523 --> 00:40:06,356
l'd hate to go to all this
trouble without an audience.

729
00:40:06,393 --> 00:40:08,418
Professor, you'll be killed.

730
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:10,156
What do you think you're doing?

731
00:40:10,196 --> 00:40:11,959
Making history.

732
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:15,661
You might want to record this
for posterity and all that.

733
00:40:15,702 --> 00:40:18,136
He's about 60 seconds
from impact.

734
00:40:18,171 --> 00:40:20,639
Gideon, you don't
have to do this.

735
00:40:20,673 --> 00:40:22,903
We found a way to save Nidell.

736
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:25,502
l had a feeling you would,
Commander.

737
00:40:25,545 --> 00:40:29,072
But this is the only way
l can really set her free

738
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:30,980
and l owe her that.

739
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:33,645
Besides, this'll be
my crowning achievement.

740
00:40:33,686 --> 00:40:36,553
Remember <i>The Fall of Kang?</i>

741
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:39,922
Well, this is one warrior
who refuses to be pitied.

742
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,551
What's he talking about?

743
00:40:41,594 --> 00:40:42,652
Klingon poetry.

744
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:44,219
30 seconds from impact.

745
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:47,995
Gideon, l want you to turn
the shuttlepod around now.

746
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:49,001
That's an order.

747
00:40:49,035 --> 00:40:50,263
Too late, Commander.

748
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:52,567
l've already entered
the gravity well of the star.

749
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:54,596
Engage the tractor beam.

750
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:56,006
He disabled it before he left.

751
00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:57,804
Commander, when all this is over

752
00:40:57,844 --> 00:40:59,778
you'll find a case
among my personal belongings.

753
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:01,678
There's something in there
l want you to find.

754
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:02,942
What is it?

755
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:04,641
My obituary.

756
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:07,680
l wrote it myself.

757
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,052
After all, l couldn't leave
such an important document

758
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,284
to some stranger.

759
00:41:11,324 --> 00:41:13,053
Do me a favor,
and see that it's sent

760
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:15,789
to the Daystrom lnstitute
for publication, huh?

761
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:17,262
You have my word.

762
00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:18,662
Oh, which reminds me

763
00:41:18,698 --> 00:41:22,065
l didn't get a chance
to update it before l left.

764
00:41:22,102 --> 00:41:23,467
Let the record state

765
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:26,961
that he sacrificed himself
on the altar of science.

766
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:27,904
Ten seconds.

767
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:30,603
l'll be sure they get it.

768
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:32,406
l'm sure l can count on you.

769
00:41:32,445 --> 00:41:34,413
Five seconds.

770
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:37,541
Keep your eye
on the viewscreen, Commander.

771
00:41:37,584 --> 00:41:39,677
You'll never see
anything like this again.

772
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:41,380
Let there be light!

773
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:25,694
Station Log, supplemental.

774
00:42:25,732 --> 00:42:28,724
Epsilon 1 19 continues
to burn brightly--

775
00:42:28,768 --> 00:42:31,737
a fitting memorial
to a brilliant man.

776
00:42:31,771 --> 00:42:34,069
Meanwhile, l'm happy to report

777
00:42:34,107 --> 00:42:36,871
Nidell has made
a complete recovery.

778
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,847
Unfortunately, she has no memory
of Fenna's experiences.

779
00:42:41,881 --> 00:42:43,007
Commander.

780
00:42:45,652 --> 00:42:46,846
Nidell.

781
00:42:46,886 --> 00:42:48,877
How did you know l was here?

782
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:51,186
Lieutenant Dax told me.

783
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:53,988
So...

784
00:42:54,027 --> 00:42:56,120
when does the <i>Prometheus</i> leave?

785
00:42:56,162 --> 00:42:58,824
Soon.

786
00:42:58,865 --> 00:43:01,732
l just wanted to say
good-bye and thank you.

787
00:43:01,768 --> 00:43:04,236
lt'll be good to get home.

788
00:43:05,872 --> 00:43:09,603
How long do you plan
on staying on New Halana?

789
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:11,633
For the rest of my life.

790
00:43:11,678 --> 00:43:14,374
l've been gone
too long as it is.

791
00:43:26,392 --> 00:43:29,020
l wish that l could
remember Fenna.

792
00:43:30,263 --> 00:43:32,390
What she did...

793
00:43:32,432 --> 00:43:34,297
how she felt.

794
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:36,962
But l can't.
l'm sorry.

795
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,697
lt's all right.

796
00:43:38,738 --> 00:43:42,105
l can remember for both of us.

797
00:43:44,077 --> 00:43:45,635
Tell me one thing.

798
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:47,202
lf l can.

799
00:43:49,048 --> 00:43:51,243
What was she like?

800
00:43:51,284 --> 00:43:52,808
Fenna?

801
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:04,259
She was just like you.
