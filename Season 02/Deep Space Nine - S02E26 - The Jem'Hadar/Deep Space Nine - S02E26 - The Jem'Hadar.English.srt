1
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:14,168
Hey, Jake.

2
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:15,639
What's all this?

3
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:17,141
My science project.

4
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:19,837
l'm growing Bajoran
katterpods to find out

5
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:22,176
which hybrid yields
the biggest root.

6
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:25,148
That's it? You're just
going to watch it grow?

7
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:26,707
Yeah. Pretty neat, huh?

8
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:28,413
Hmm. Not bad.

9
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:32,617
But don't you think
it's a little low-tech?

10
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:36,094
l'm a low-tech kind of guy, Dad.

11
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:38,028
l still think
you can do something

12
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:39,553
a little more challenging.

13
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:42,829
lf you could do any
science project you wanted to

14
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:45,336
anything at all,
what would it be?

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,200
Learn how to pilot a runabout?

16
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:53,608
Well, that's not exactly
a science project, is it?

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,770
Second choice.

18
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,214
Visit the Gamma Quadrant?

19
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,152
And what would you do
when you got there?

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,655
l don't know. l...

21
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,749
l could do a planetary survey.

22
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,259
Not bad.

23
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:11,863
All right, let's do it.

24
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:13,592
Really?

25
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:15,998
lt'll be like a vacation,
a working vacation.

26
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,865
That's great!
Thanks, Dad.

27
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:20,030
l'll bet we'll have
a great time.

28
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:21,437
l know we will.

29
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,674
Let's see.

30
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,010
We have a Bolian freighter
due in day after tomorrow.

31
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,140
We'll be outfitting
another group of settlers

32
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:33,014
leaving for New Bajor.

33
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,986
You know, l heard
their new irrigation system

34
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:37,010
is really something to see.

35
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,386
When you get
to the Gamma Quadrant

36
00:01:38,423 --> 00:01:39,390
you ought to take a look.

37
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:40,482
Not this trip.

38
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:43,653
l really want to spend
some time alone with Jake.

39
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:46,823
When's the <i>Odyssey</i> due back
from the Cardassian border?

40
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:48,093
Three days.

41
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:52,433
lt's a shame l'll have to miss
your reunion with Captain Keogh.

42
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:56,498
Don't you find him
just a little arrogant?

43
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,941
Funny... he said
the same thing about you.

44
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:00,968
Did he?

45
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:03,913
Commander, your son's
here to see you.

46
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:05,416
Send him in.

47
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,078
He's really looking
forward to this trip.

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,587
Dad, guess what?

49
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:11,486
l was talking to Nog

50
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:13,150
and it turns out
he's having trouble

51
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:14,658
coming up
with a science project

52
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:16,422
so l told him
he could be my partner.

53
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:20,392
We can finish this up later.

54
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,059
Partner?

55
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,001
We asked Mrs. O'Brien,
and she said it would be okay

56
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:28,130
so l invited Nog to come
with us to the Gamma Quadrant.

57
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:31,301
Now, hold on a second, Jake-o.

58
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:33,038
Dad, if Nog doesn't get
a good grade

59
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:34,170
on this science project

60
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:36,407
he's going to drop out
of school.

61
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,040
And l can't let that happen.

62
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,416
Maybe he can help you analyze
the survey information

63
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,920
when we get back.

64
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,012
That's not enough.

65
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:46,990
Mrs. O'Brien said he'd have
to be an equal partner.

66
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:49,016
Come on, Dad.

67
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:53,697
He's my friend.

68
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:55,359
l have to help him.

69
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:06,570
Morn, you've been
sitting here all day

70
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,602
staring at the same drink.

71
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,114
Talk to me.

72
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,615
l want to help.

73
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,142
l'm not just your bartender,
l'm your friend.

74
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:18,245
Whatever's wrong,
l'm here for you.

75
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,985
Hold that thought.

76
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,788
Well, uh, what did he say?

77
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,317
What did who say?

78
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:26,159
Commander Sisko--
about my idea.

79
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,131
You mean using the monitors

80
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,964
throughout the station
to sell merchandise?

81
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,526
Stop torturing me, Odo.

82
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:33,970
Tell me what he said.

83
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,472
Guess.

84
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,974
He said yes.

85
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,635
Guess again.

86
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,440
lt would triple my profits.

87
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,969
How could he refuse?

88
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,981
Maybe it's because
he doesn't like you.

89
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,642
Don't be ridiculous.

90
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,481
Major Kira is the one
that doesn't like me.

91
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,486
Sisko...

92
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,487
Doesn't like you either.

93
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,488
What'd l ever do to him?

94
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,490
Oh, l could think
of one or two things.

95
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,991
Oh, one or two things,
that's nothing.

96
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,391
So, do you think there's any way
l can change his mind?

97
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,165
Uncle Quark?

98
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,598
Not now.

99
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:04,101
l just wanted to tell you

100
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:05,659
l'm not going to be able
to work my shift

101
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,762
for the next couple of days.

102
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:08,272
Why not?

103
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,399
l-l'm going
to the Gamma Quadrant

104
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:12,137
with Jake and his father.

105
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:15,042
You're going
to the Gamma Quadrant

106
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,048
with Commander Sisko.

107
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:21,779
How lucky for you.

108
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,776
Oh, l always wanted to see

109
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:31,008
what the cockpit
of a runabout looked like.

110
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:33,449
Hey, how do you fire
the phasers?

111
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:34,679
Nog, you promised.

112
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:36,346
Oh, l wasn't going
to touch anything.

113
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:38,982
Why don't the two of you
stow our gear away in the back

114
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,491
while l go through prelaunch?

115
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,550
l'll do it.

116
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:46,030
l'll be right there.

117
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:47,622
''Fire the phasers''?

118
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,156
He was just kidding.

119
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:50,165
Look, Dad, l know

120
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:51,997
this isn't exactly
the trip you planned on

121
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,902
but you'll see--
Nog's a great guy.

122
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:55,132
l'm sure he is.

123
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:57,937
l was just hoping that you and l
could spend this time together.

124
00:06:57,976 --> 00:06:59,170
We will. Don't worry.

125
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,178
You won't even
know Nog's along.

126
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,611
This'll be a great
trip, you'll see.

127
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,240
Ah, there you are.

128
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:06,773
Where do l put my bags?

129
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:08,843
Uncle Quark,
what are you doing here?

130
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,355
What does it look like?
l'm going with you.

131
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,754
Since when?

132
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,589
Really, Commander,
you don't expect my nephew

133
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:18,027
to go all the way
to the Gamma Quadrant

134
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,758
without proper supervision?

135
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:22,526
No offense--

136
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,228
some of my best friends
are humans--

137
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:28,467
but my brother, Rom,
isn't as liberal as l am.

138
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:30,531
Let's face it--
he's never been comfortable

139
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,270
about Nog's friendship
with your son.

140
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,403
You can tell Rom not to worry.

141
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:36,641
l'll take good care of the boy

142
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,376
and l promise l won't try

143
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,941
to corrupt him
with my human values.

144
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:42,452
l know that

145
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:45,979
but Rom is convinced all humans
look down upon Ferengi

146
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:48,857
and by allowing me
to come on this trip

147
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:50,986
you can help prove him wrong.

148
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,020
He is wrong, isn't he?

149
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,887
Dad, please.

150
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:01,428
All right.

151
00:08:01,462 --> 00:08:04,260
Let's get going
before anyone else shows up.

152
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,266
Thanks, Dad, thanks.

153
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,790
Whoo-hoo.

154
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:25,418
This place is great.

155
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:29,081
Our preliminary surveys suggest
it's a lot like Earth

156
00:08:29,123 --> 00:08:30,920
during the early
Devonian period--

157
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,119
a lot of plant life,
fish, some insects

158
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:36,526
but no predators
or large animals.

159
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:37,860
Pretty, isn't it?

160
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:39,695
l don't see
what's so pretty about it.

161
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,394
l think they mean
the trees and stuff.

162
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:43,596
Quark, this is
as close to paradise

163
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:44,729
as you're going to get.

164
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:47,467
All you need to do is to allow
yourself to see it.

165
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:49,066
l'll tell you what l see.

166
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:53,136
ln two words--
exploitable resources.

167
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,876
l suppose you want
to cut down all these trees

168
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,009
and start strip mining
the entire planet.

169
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:00,246
As a wise man once wrote

170
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:04,280
''Nature decays,
but latinum lasts forever.''

171
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:06,451
Rule of Acquisition
Number 102.

172
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:07,960
Good lad.

173
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:10,793
Nog, l have some ointment
in one of my bags. Get it.

174
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:13,061
What's the problem?

175
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,762
Oh, l get a mild reaction
now and then.

176
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:17,394
To what?

177
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,098
Nature.

178
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:20,401
Perhaps you'd be
more comfortable

179
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,407
sleeping on the runabout.

180
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:23,432
And miss all the fun?

181
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:25,104
Never.

182
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:27,636
Besides, l'm really
looking forward

183
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:30,650
to our getting to
know each other better.

184
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:47,158
Ah, that's much better.

185
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:52,099
Now, if it only wasn't so hot.

186
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:53,800
l hadn't noticed.

187
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,334
lt isn't the heat so much
as the humidity and the insects

188
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:00,505
the stench of these flowers.

189
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:03,038
l'm glad we could
talk like this.

190
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,143
There's nothing like
facing the wilderness

191
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:08,154
to bring people closer.

192
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:09,849
The answer is still no, Quark.

193
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,357
No? No to what?

194
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:13,757
l'm not going to allow you
to sell merchandise

195
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:15,728
over the station's monitors.

196
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:17,059
Why not?

197
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:18,564
lt's a brilliant idea.

198
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,032
With my connections

199
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:22,297
l could offer
a whole range of merchandise

200
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:25,430
which normally couldn't
be acquired in this sector.

201
00:10:25,472 --> 00:10:26,598
Such as?

202
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,800
Collectibles...

203
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:30,067
Andorian jewelry

204
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,407
Vulcan lDlC pins

205
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:33,640
Bolian crystalsteel...

206
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,046
And with my low overhead

207
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,382
l could offer these items
at a significant discount.

208
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:44,851
Quark, you're wasting
your time and mine.

209
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:46,119
Ah, ah, ah...

210
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,717
Did l mention
l was going to donate

211
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:51,094
two percent of my net profits
to the Bajoran Fund for Orphans?

212
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:54,126
Three percent?

213
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:59,102
So, how's it going?

214
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,607
The atmosphere
is 77% nitrogen

215
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:04,133
21% oxygen
and 2% carbon dioxide.

216
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:07,112
The water contains
traces of copper, nickel

217
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:08,842
and a little birythium.

218
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:10,509
You're showing
a little lead there, too.

219
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,812
That's from
the surrounding soil

220
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:12,978
but we think it's localized.

221
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,009
We're going to check

222
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:15,885
other water sources,
just to be sure.

223
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:17,253
Why not wait until tomorrow?

224
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,758
l was just about
to start dinner.

225
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:19,759
Jambalaya?

226
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:20,760
How did you know?

227
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:21,783
Great!

228
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:22,920
Jambawhat?

229
00:11:22,963 --> 00:11:24,988
You're going to love it.

230
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:27,694
The two of you
did good work today.

231
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:31,863
Yes!

232
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,176
Anyone want some more?

233
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,677
Not me.

234
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:41,180
Oh, me neither, Commander,
but it was very good.

235
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:42,681
You know, l think

236
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:45,184
l'm developing a taste
for human food.

237
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:46,708
Quark?

238
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:51,781
l still say there's
some dirt in the sauce.

239
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:53,793
And these bugs.

240
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:54,987
Look at this.

241
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:57,326
They get into everything.

242
00:11:57,364 --> 00:11:58,922
lt's disgusting.

243
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:01,195
l thought the Ferengis
liked eating bugs.

244
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:05,931
Only certain bugs--
Ferengi bugs.

245
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:10,375
Nog, get some more ointment
for the back of my neck.

246
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,469
Yes, Uncle.

247
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,477
Better get a good night's sleep.

248
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:20,645
You have another
big day tomorrow.

249
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:23,986
Yeah, l want to start
cataloging the plant life

250
00:12:24,024 --> 00:12:25,889
first thing in the morning.

251
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:28,656
You know what this reminds of?

252
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:30,162
Hmm.

253
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,529
The camping trip we took
on ltamish lll.

254
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:36,502
l don't think
l remember you, me and Mom

255
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:38,731
ever having more fun together.

256
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:40,171
Hmm.

257
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:43,504
lsn't that where l taught
you how to water ski?

258
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:46,910
Mom taught me
how to water ski.

259
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:50,041
Yes. She always was
the graceful one.

260
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:55,518
You know, Jake...

261
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:59,684
we really need to get away
more often.

262
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:01,284
l'm ready whenever you are.

263
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:02,818
l'm sure Nog is, too.

264
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:05,758
l'm joking.

265
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:10,195
l'm on fire!

266
00:13:11,271 --> 00:13:12,898
l'm on fire!

267
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,531
Quark!

268
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:17,736
Cover it up!

269
00:13:19,413 --> 00:13:20,880
Are you all right?

270
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:23,712
No!
l am not all right.

271
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,741
My ears itch,
my nose is running

272
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:27,310
l'm eating foreign bugs!

273
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:28,582
Now look at me!

274
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:30,112
One minute l'm trying
to pick a couple of bugs

275
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:31,784
out of that jumba-what's-a-pot

276
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:33,793
the next thing l know--
whoosh!

277
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:35,124
Quark, calm down.

278
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:36,959
Look, do us all a favor.

279
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:39,522
Sit down and try
to stay out of trouble.

280
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:40,863
What did l do?

281
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:45,694
l'd better go see if he's okay.

282
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:49,172
Now, see what you've done.

283
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:50,767
What l've done?

284
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:54,577
The boy couldn't stand seeing
his favorite uncle insulted.

285
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:57,515
l guess Rom was right after all.

286
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:58,916
You don't like Ferengi, do you?

287
00:13:58,952 --> 00:13:59,919
That is not true.

288
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:00,920
All right.

289
00:14:00,954 --> 00:14:03,115
Name me one Ferengi
you do like.

290
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,454
Aha! You see?
l was right.

291
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:08,120
You Federation types
are all alike.

292
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:11,686
You talk about tolerance
and understanding

293
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:13,562
but you only practice it

294
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,501
towards people who remind
you of yourselves.

295
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:20,028
Because you disapprove
of Ferengi values

296
00:14:20,073 --> 00:14:22,541
you scorn us, distrust us

297
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:25,875
insult us
every chance you get.

298
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:28,312
Quark, l don't have to stand
here and defend myself.

299
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:29,645
Tell me, Commander.

300
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:31,878
Would you allow your son
to marry a Ferengi female?

301
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,146
l never thought about it!

302
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:34,743
Exactly my point.

303
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:45,895
Don't hurt me.

304
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,422
How many of them are there?

305
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,401
There's just the two of us.

306
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:51,631
Not you, the Jem'Hadar.

307
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:56,039
We don't know
who you're talking about.

308
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:58,067
We are not your enemies.

309
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:01,329
Then you'd better run.

310
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:10,768
lt's too late.

311
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:13,433
You're done running.

312
00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:19,109
This has not been a good day.

313
00:15:41,102 --> 00:15:43,764
Dad, this is Jake.
Where are you?

314
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:45,136
Dad, answer me.

315
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:47,639
l'm telling you, Jake,
something's happened to them.

316
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:49,905
Maybe they were attacked
by a wild animal.

317
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:51,036
You heard my dad.

318
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:53,444
There aren't any wild animals
just insects and plants.

319
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:55,847
Maybe they were attacked
by a vicious tree.

320
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:59,182
Hmm... take a look at this.

321
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:04,090
l don't know any trees
that wear boots.

322
00:16:04,158 --> 00:16:06,752
We'd better beam up
to the runabout.

323
00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:08,455
Listen, we can't run away
just 'cause we're scared.

324
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:11,192
Hey, who said anything
about being scared?

325
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:14,224
l just thought the runabout
would be a good place

326
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:15,860
to, uh, to plan our next move.

327
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:17,564
There's nothing to plan.

328
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:18,936
My dad never would
have left here

329
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:19,997
without telling me first.

330
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,441
Not unless he was in
some sort of trouble.

331
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,911
We can track him
with the tricorder.

332
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:26,106
Hmm...

333
00:16:26,147 --> 00:16:28,980
Hey! Wait for me!

334
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:33,512
Hey!

335
00:16:33,554 --> 00:16:35,419
ls anybody there?

336
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:37,014
Hello?

337
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:38,685
We're humanoids.

338
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:40,694
We require food and water.

339
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:42,355
Hello?

340
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:44,125
Quark, shut up.

341
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:45,859
This is your fault.

342
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,925
They were after you, not us.

343
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:50,665
Why don't you say
something to them?

344
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:53,503
Tell them you'd
never seen us before.

345
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,736
We have nothing
to do with her.

346
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:57,573
This is a misunderstanding.

347
00:16:57,612 --> 00:16:59,079
Quark...

348
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:01,673
l have the right
to express my opinion.

349
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:03,980
l'm about to put my fist
in your opinion.

350
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:05,485
You don't scare me.

351
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,647
And you want to know why
you don't scare me?

352
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:09,178
Because l'm already
more scared

353
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:10,747
than l've ever been
in my life.

354
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,281
You're not helping anything.

355
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:14,351
l'm not helping anything?

356
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:17,922
l don't see you coming up
with any ideas, or her.

357
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:20,661
lf she wants to help us,
she will.

358
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:23,226
Right now, l'd say she's even
more scared than you are.

359
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:25,535
Believe me, she's not.

360
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,739
She's obviously been running
from these people for a while.

361
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,341
She's probably
been through a lot.

362
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:38,682
She doesn't know who we are
or what we're about.

363
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,210
l just hope that Jake and Nog

364
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:43,086
are smart enough
to stay out of sight

365
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:44,216
until help gets here.

366
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:46,692
Trust me, l didn't raise
my nephew to be a fool.

367
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:49,696
He'll find the nearest dark
hole and climb into it.

368
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,561
l'm not so sure about Jake.

369
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,829
lf l know him,
he'll be looking for us.

370
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:56,393
Don't they teach you
how to neutralize

371
00:17:56,437 --> 00:17:58,496
security fields
in Starfleet?

372
00:17:59,907 --> 00:18:02,603
l've never seen anything
like this before.

373
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:04,873
lt seems to be generated by...

374
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:06,311
Don't.

375
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:08,474
The security barrier
will kill you.

376
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:11,212
Thanks for the warning.

377
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:13,550
l have no wish
to see you hurt.

378
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:15,249
A lovely sentiment.

379
00:18:21,162 --> 00:18:22,652
How did you know

380
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:25,188
that the security
barrier is lethal?

381
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:28,099
Because everything about
the Jem'Hadar is lethal.

382
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:31,798
Anything you could tell me
about them might be helpful.

383
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:36,201
Are you saying you've never
heard of the Jem'Hadar?

384
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:40,111
Oh, we're not
from around here.

385
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:42,581
My name is Benjamin Sisko.

386
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:45,450
l'm from the United Federation
of Planets.

387
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:48,421
We came through
a wormhole to get here.

388
00:18:48,456 --> 00:18:51,482
Our home is thousands
of light years away.

389
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:53,459
My name is Eris.

390
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:56,088
l'm glad to meet you...

391
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,927
Eris.

392
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,907
That's Quark.

393
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:12,972
Tell me about the Jem'Hadar.

394
00:19:13,014 --> 00:19:15,380
They are the most feared
soldiers in the Dominion.

395
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,815
The Dominion?

396
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:19,877
The Ferengi have been trying
to open up trade negotiations

397
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,979
with the Dominion
for almost a year now.

398
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:23,820
We've never heard
of the Jem'Hadar.

399
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,917
Then you've been fortunate.

400
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,326
Negotiations with the Dominion

401
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:29,989
can be a dangerous thing.

402
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:33,000
lf it's so dangerous, why would
anyone do business with them?

403
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:38,028
The Dominion decides that you
have something that they want

404
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:42,600
and then they come and take it
by negotiation or by force.

405
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:45,237
Believe me, l know.

406
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,715
l've seen it happen
on my own world.

407
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:52,344
Kurill Prime was offered entry
into the Dominion.

408
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:55,617
They thought
our telekinetic powers would be

409
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:56,918
useful to them.

410
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:58,447
Back there in the camp--

411
00:19:58,492 --> 00:20:00,892
that's what you used
to knock me down.

412
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:07,225
When Kurill refused
the Dominion's offer

413
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:09,361
they sent in the Jem'Hadar.

414
00:20:09,403 --> 00:20:12,372
They destroyed
our communication center

415
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:14,271
they executed our leaders

416
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:16,276
and before we realized it

417
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,393
they had seized control
of the entire planet.

418
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:21,289
How did you manage to escape?

419
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:22,886
l was on a freighter

420
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,763
going home
when the attack occurred.

421
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,768
We fled, but they came after us.

422
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:32,194
Why?

423
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,608
My mother was an outspoken
opponent of the Dominion.

424
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:40,670
l guess they wanted to make
an example of my family.

425
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:42,875
That thing they put
around your neck...

426
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,111
lt suppresses
my telekinetic abilities.

427
00:20:45,152 --> 00:20:46,744
Without it, l might be able

428
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,051
to break though
the security barrier.

429
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:52,081
Then we'll just have to find
a way to get this collar off.

430
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,822
Well, even if we get past
the barrier

431
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:58,627
no one ever escapes
from the Jem'Hadar.

432
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:02,692
Luckily for us, they seem
as sure about that as you do.

433
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:04,465
Look around you.

434
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:08,669
They placed the three of us
in the same containment field.

435
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:13,009
l've never seen more than four
guards on duty at any one time.

436
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:14,513
As far as l can tell

437
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:16,914
there's only this single
containment field

438
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,508
between us and freedom.

439
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:20,019
They're overconfident

440
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:23,079
and that's what's going
to help us get out of here.

441
00:21:23,123 --> 00:21:25,421
Maybe if l can pry off
that casing

442
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:27,427
l can get at
the locking mechanism.

443
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:29,759
May l?

444
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:31,354
Of course.

445
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:36,859
You sure you know
how to read that thing?

446
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:37,871
Pretty sure.

447
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:39,338
Pretty sure?

448
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:42,069
We've been walking for hours,
and you're only pretty sure?

449
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:43,235
Would you be quiet?

450
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:45,541
l'm picking up some kind
of humanoid life-forms.

451
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:50,042
l don't know who they are

452
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,017
but they don't look friendly.

453
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:53,883
l wish we could get closer.

454
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:57,049
l don't think they'll look
any friendlier close up.

455
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,194
Hello?

456
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:11,796
l know someone must be
listening to me out there.

457
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:15,001
lf we escape, do we have
to take him with us?

458
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,202
He's not so bad.

459
00:22:16,243 --> 00:22:17,608
Whoever's in charge

460
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:20,875
you're missing a very
lucrative opportunity...

461
00:22:20,914 --> 00:22:23,474
Doesn't he realize he's not
accomplishing anything?

462
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:24,575
Don't be so sure.

463
00:22:24,618 --> 00:22:25,585
We need to know

464
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:28,053
what the Jem'Hadar
plan to do with us

465
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:29,885
which means we need
to get their attention.

466
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:31,481
And if there's
one thing l know...

467
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:34,221
That's enough.

468
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:37,526
...it's that Quark
is hard to ignore.

469
00:22:45,939 --> 00:22:47,930
l'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

470
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:50,102
of the United Federation
of Planets.

471
00:22:50,177 --> 00:22:51,804
l want to know why we
are being held here.

472
00:22:51,845 --> 00:22:54,871
That's not my concern.

473
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,780
Then why won't you let us go?

474
00:22:56,817 --> 00:22:59,217
Because the Founders
don't want you released.

475
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,117
And who are the Founders?

476
00:23:01,154 --> 00:23:03,588
That's not your concern.

477
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:04,921
This isn't getting
us anywhere.

478
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:05,982
Commander, allow me.

479
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:08,392
How would you like
a thousand cases

480
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,986
of tulaberry wine?

481
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,429
Don't bother, Commander.

482
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:17,267
l'm not going to do
any permanent damage.

483
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,936
lf the Founders are the ones
who give the orders

484
00:23:23,977 --> 00:23:25,444
l want to meet them.

485
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,174
Those aren't my orders.

486
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:29,512
He can't take you
to the Founders

487
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:30,880
because they don't exist.

488
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:32,009
They're a myth.

489
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:33,349
The Founders exist.

490
00:23:33,387 --> 00:23:35,617
They created the Dominion.

491
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:39,114
And the Jem'Hadar
are their servants?

492
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:47,090
A Ferengi and a human.

493
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,625
l was hoping
the first race l'd meet

494
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,070
from the other side
of the anomaly

495
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:54,096
would be the Klingons.

496
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:56,198
l'm sorry to disappoint you.

497
00:23:56,243 --> 00:23:58,768
lt's too late for apologies.

498
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,111
The Dominion will
no longer stand by

499
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,380
and allow ships from your side
to violate our territory.

500
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,256
l hear the Klingons
are effective warriors.

501
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:16,251
What's that weapon they're
so fond of... the <i>bat'leth?</i>

502
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:19,163
l am not interested
in discussing the Klingons.

503
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,826
All right.

504
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:23,301
Then what about the Cardassians?

505
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,896
Are you satisfied
with the treaty

506
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:28,407
your Federation made with them?

507
00:24:28,442 --> 00:24:30,535
lt seems a tactical error.

508
00:24:30,577 --> 00:24:34,069
How do you know so much
about our side of the galaxy?

509
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,615
We gain more knowledge every day

510
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,448
and now we have you
to help us learn more.

511
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:42,580
l don't plan
on telling you anything.

512
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:44,715
l won't be the one asking
the questions.

513
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:46,589
Who will?

514
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:50,187
l was really hoping
to meet a Klingon.

515
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:08,642
Well, now that
we're all friends

516
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:10,912
l feel so much better.

517
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:32,236
l hope this works.

518
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:33,830
You wanted a plan,
l came up with a plan.

519
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:34,898
Now let me concentrate.

520
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:37,774
Computer, scan the region
around our base camp

521
00:25:37,811 --> 00:25:39,836
for human and
Ferengi life-signs.

522
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,939
One human
and one Ferengi located.

523
00:25:41,982 --> 00:25:43,006
That's them.

524
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,641
l told you this would work.

525
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:47,084
Computer, lock onto
the two life-forms

526
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,178
and beam them up.

527
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:49,654
Unable to comply.

528
00:25:49,689 --> 00:25:53,420
Subjects are located inside
a spatial distortion field.

529
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,724
l knew it couldn't be
that easy.

530
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,890
Maybe we'd better go back
to the station for help.

531
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,058
Good idea.

532
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,466
Computer, fly us back
to the station.

533
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:04,402
Please restate command.

534
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,905
Computer, disengage autopilot

535
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,398
and lay in a course
back to the wormhole.

536
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,809
Enter authorization code.

537
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:14,315
Go ahead.

538
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,279
What are you waiting for?

539
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:18,148
l don't know
the authorization code!

540
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,676
Vessel approaching
from the planet's surface

541
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:23,121
bearing 173 mark 281.

542
00:26:23,157 --> 00:26:25,819
Computer, evasive maneuvers!

543
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,487
Fire phasers!

544
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:30,122
Launch torpedoes...
and escape pods!

545
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:33,561
Computer, display

546
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,796
the approaching ship
on the monitor.

547
00:26:35,836 --> 00:26:38,031
Computer, where did the ship go?

548
00:26:38,072 --> 00:26:43,203
The vessel has entered warp
bearing 17 1 mark 259.

549
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:47,677
Oh, maybe they didn't see us.

550
00:26:47,715 --> 00:26:50,980
Maybe we're not
what they're after.

551
00:26:51,018 --> 00:26:52,918
So, what do we do now?

552
00:26:52,953 --> 00:26:55,421
We'll have to shut down
the autopilot.

553
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:57,253
How do we do that?

554
00:26:57,291 --> 00:27:00,055
l guess we'll find out
how much l learned

555
00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:02,392
working for Chief O'Brien.

556
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:15,402
Lieutenant, what's the ETA
on the <i>Odysse</i>y?.

557
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:16,637
They're due in eight hours.

558
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,338
l'm reading
elevated neutrino levels

559
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:19,346
from the wormhole.

560
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,211
On screen.

561
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:26,711
Hail them, Lieutenant.

562
00:27:26,754 --> 00:27:27,914
They're not answering.

563
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:29,320
Shields up.
Go to Yellow Alert.

564
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,484
Computer, intruder in Ops.

565
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,153
Activate a level-3
containment field.

566
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:40,025
l'm Major Kira Nerys,
First Officer of this station.

567
00:27:40,134 --> 00:27:42,728
You'll have to excuse
the containment field

568
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,704
but, around here, it's customary

569
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:47,172
to identify yourself
before transporting

570
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,869
into someone else's
command center.

571
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:51,639
l'm Third Talak'talan
of the Jem'Hadar.

572
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,647
l'm here to inform you
that your Commander

573
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:56,309
has been detained
for questioning by the Dominion.

574
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,250
Detained?
For how long?

575
00:27:58,285 --> 00:27:59,718
lndefinitely.

576
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:01,721
Commander Sisko will serve
as an example

577
00:28:01,755 --> 00:28:05,714
of what happens to anyone who
interferes with the Dominion.

578
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,818
What kind of interference
are you talking about?

579
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:11,263
Coming through the anomaly
is interference enough.

580
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:13,789
Unless you wish to continue
to offend the Dominion

581
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:16,132
l suggest you stay
on your side of the galaxy.

582
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,161
You're making a mistake
if you think

583
00:28:18,205 --> 00:28:20,002
that detaining Commander Sisko
will stop us

584
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,541
from exploring
the Gamma Quadrant.

585
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,374
We anticipated that response.

586
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,238
Security team to Ops.

587
00:28:29,283 --> 00:28:32,719
Here's a list of vessels
we've destroyed

588
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,221
for violating our territory.

589
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:45,260
Where'd you get this datapadd?

590
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:49,201
From the Bajoran colony
on our side of the anomaly.

591
00:28:49,236 --> 00:28:51,204
You should be proud.

592
00:28:51,238 --> 00:28:54,696
l hear they fought well
for a spiritual people.

593
00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:59,008
l hope we won't have to repeat
this lesson.

594
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:02,846
Chief, lock a tractor beam
onto his ship.

595
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:03,850
Acknowledged.

596
00:29:03,884 --> 00:29:05,317
l can't establish a lock, Major.

597
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:06,979
They must have
some kind of deflectors

598
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:08,145
we haven't seen before.

599
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:09,985
They've entered the wormhole.

600
00:29:10,024 --> 00:29:11,286
We've lost them.

601
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,767
Got it.

602
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:25,431
lt looks like some kind
of multiple-locking system.

603
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,997
Even if l can break through
the security barrier

604
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:30,101
how do you plan
to get off the planet?

605
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,611
We'll try to find my son.

606
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,476
We'll use his communicator

607
00:29:33,514 --> 00:29:36,244
to signal my ship and transport
us off the surface.

608
00:29:36,283 --> 00:29:38,547
And then what?

609
00:29:40,254 --> 00:29:43,018
You're welcome to come back
to the station with us.

610
00:29:43,123 --> 00:29:46,354
l'm sure Starfleet would
like to hear anything

611
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:49,453
you have to tell them
about the Dominion.

612
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,556
l'd be glad to tell them
all l know.

613
00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:56,869
Quark

614
00:29:56,904 --> 00:29:59,566
maybe you'd better
take a look at this.

615
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:01,040
Sure.

616
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:03,872
''Quark, be quiet.
Quark, stand watch.

617
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:05,606
Quark, pick a lock.''

618
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:07,045
All you ever do
is order me around.

619
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:09,047
You know, Commander,
l think l've figured out

620
00:30:09,116 --> 00:30:10,413
why humans don't like Ferengi.

621
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:11,748
Not now, Quark.

622
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:13,252
The way l see it

623
00:30:13,287 --> 00:30:16,188
humans used to be a lot
like Ferengi-- greedy

624
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:18,657
acquisitive, interested
only in profit.

625
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,956
We're a constant reminder
of a part of your past

626
00:30:20,995 --> 00:30:21,984
you'd like to forget.

627
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,429
Quark, we don't
have time for this.

628
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:26,797
But you're overlooking
something.

629
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:30,031
Humans used to be a lot
worse than the Ferengi--

630
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,332
slavery...

631
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,897
concentration camps

632
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:36,068
interstellar wars.

633
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:38,872
We have nothing in our past

634
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:42,211
that approaches
that kind of barbarism.

635
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:43,716
You see?

636
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:45,616
We're nothing like you.

637
00:30:45,653 --> 00:30:47,450
We're better.

638
00:30:48,922 --> 00:30:52,085
Now... if you'll excuse me...

639
00:30:52,192 --> 00:30:55,093
l have a lock to pick.

640
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:03,393
This shouldn't be so hard.

641
00:31:03,437 --> 00:31:06,031
l just watched Chief O'Brien
run a maintenance check

642
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:09,007
on the <i>Mekong's</i> navigational
array a couple of weeks ago.

643
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:10,442
Well, from the looks of things

644
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:12,445
you haven't been
watching very closely.

645
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:13,537
Try that one.

646
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,605
l don't think that's it.

647
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:17,640
Try it.
l have a hunch.

648
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:19,482
All right.
Let's see.

649
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,217
Warning. Warp core collapse
in ten seconds.

650
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:24,622
Nine, eight...

651
00:31:24,658 --> 00:31:27,024
Put it back,
put it back!

652
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:28,358
...seven, six...

653
00:31:28,395 --> 00:31:33,458
Warp core containment field
stabilized.

654
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,161
Sorry.

655
00:31:35,202 --> 00:31:36,499
Wait a second...

656
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:38,334
the ''G and N'' relay.

657
00:31:38,372 --> 00:31:39,839
What about it?

658
00:31:39,873 --> 00:31:41,465
l think O'Brien said something

659
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:43,703
about the autopilot
being connected

660
00:31:43,744 --> 00:31:46,178
to the guidance
and navigational relay.

661
00:31:46,213 --> 00:31:48,044
lf l could just find it...

662
00:31:48,082 --> 00:31:51,176
lt was this round thing,
with this square part

663
00:31:51,218 --> 00:31:52,685
on the bottom.

664
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,449
l think l got it.

665
00:31:54,488 --> 00:31:56,251
ls that it?

666
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,882
l hope so.

667
00:31:57,925 --> 00:32:00,894
Computer, what's the status
on the autopilot?

668
00:32:00,928 --> 00:32:03,863
The automatic pilot system
is not functional.

669
00:32:03,897 --> 00:32:05,023
All right!

670
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:06,532
Yes!

671
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:09,400
Lay in a course for the wormhole
at warp eight.

672
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:10,801
Unable to comply.

673
00:32:10,838 --> 00:32:14,831
The automatic pilot system
is not functional.

674
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,502
Now what?

675
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:19,273
l guess we'll have to try
and fly it ourselves.

676
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:35,763
Starfleet's orders are simple.

677
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:37,598
Traffic through the wormhole
will be suspended

678
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:39,035
until the <i>Odyssey</i>
can investigate

679
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:40,469
the Jem'Hadar's threat.

680
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:41,996
What about Benjamin
and the others?

681
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,667
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

682
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:46,041
Commander Sisko's return
is a top priority.

683
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:47,612
lf you're going to try
to rescue them

684
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:48,772
then we're coming with you.

685
00:32:48,814 --> 00:32:50,975
Are you sure that's wise?

686
00:32:51,016 --> 00:32:53,143
With the exception
of Major Kira and Mr. O'Brien

687
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:55,176
none of you have had
much combat experience.

688
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,745
We fought the Maquis.

689
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:02,124
All the Maquis had were a pair
of lightly-armed shuttlecraft.

690
00:33:02,161 --> 00:33:05,255
l expect the Dominion
to have sharper teeth.

691
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:06,594
Well, then you're
going to need

692
00:33:06,632 --> 00:33:07,758
all the help you can get.

693
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:12,425
Mr. O'Brien, can you equip
the two remaining runabouts

694
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:15,599
with extra banks
of photon torpedoes?

695
00:33:15,641 --> 00:33:17,768
l already started retrofitting
their weapons systems.

696
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,243
They should be ready
in a few hours.

697
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:21,838
lt should take
at least that long

698
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,849
to off-load all the nonessential
personnel from the <i>Odyssey.</i>

699
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:27,113
You were planning on doing that,
weren't you?

700
00:33:27,152 --> 00:33:28,676
Lieutenant,
have you ever thought

701
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,948
of serving on a starship?

702
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:32,013
l'm happy where l am.

703
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:33,456
Good.

704
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:35,016
Major, be prepared
to leave at 1300 hours.

705
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:36,685
l'll be aboard the <i>Odyssey</i>
if you need me.

706
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:37,695
Yes, sir.

707
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:39,526
l thought you said
Keogh didn't like you.

708
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:41,863
Did l say that?

709
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,390
Come on, you heard him.

710
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:44,902
We've got three hours.

711
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:54,239
Station security is
to be on maximum alert.

712
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:56,645
l want random patrols
of all corridors

713
00:33:56,682 --> 00:33:58,547
and periodic sensor sweeps
of every level.

714
00:33:58,584 --> 00:34:01,519
Now, the provisional government
has agreed to send us

715
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:04,113
a detachment
of extra security personnel.

716
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:06,147
This outlines
how l want them deployed.

717
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:07,249
Odo.

718
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,281
Major.

719
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:09,385
That will be all.

720
00:34:09,428 --> 00:34:11,794
Captain Keogh has moved up
our departure time.

721
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,422
We have to be ready
in 15 minutes.

722
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:15,456
l am on my way
to meet Chief O'Brien

723
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:18,470
and Lieutenant Dax
at the <i>Mekong</i> right now.

724
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:21,473
Are you sure that you
don't want to stay

725
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:23,134
and oversee things
here on the station?

726
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:25,234
l don't know what we're
going to come up against

727
00:34:25,277 --> 00:34:26,301
once we're there.

728
00:34:26,345 --> 00:34:28,643
Your duties do not
require you to come with us.

729
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,377
l realize that, but l figure
while you and the others

730
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:34,908
are trying to rescue
Sisko and the boys

731
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:38,013
someone ought to be there
to look out for Quark.

732
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:39,353
Quark?

733
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:40,483
Huh.

734
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:41,652
You're joking.

735
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:43,524
l thought you hated Quark.

736
00:34:43,562 --> 00:34:46,030
l do, but l'd rather
see him in jail

737
00:34:46,098 --> 00:34:48,259
than in the hands
of the Dominion.

738
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,767
Believe me, Major

739
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:51,530
if anything happened to him

740
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,696
you'd miss him, too.

741
00:34:52,738 --> 00:34:54,968
l'd be willing to take
that chance...

742
00:34:55,007 --> 00:34:56,998
but not today.

743
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:59,977
l'd better get to the <i>Orinoco.</i>

744
00:35:00,012 --> 00:35:01,707
Odo...

745
00:35:03,248 --> 00:35:04,840
keep your head down.

746
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:07,716
Make sure you do the same.

747
00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:32,238
Where's the welcoming
committee?

748
00:35:38,216 --> 00:35:40,013
Maybe the Jem'Hadar
were bluffing.

749
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:41,746
Or maybe it's a trap.

750
00:35:41,787 --> 00:35:43,277
<i>Odyssey</i> to runabouts.

751
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:44,380
Go ahead, Captain.

752
00:35:44,423 --> 00:35:46,323
Preliminary tachyon
scans are negative.

753
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:48,952
We're not detecting anything
on long-range scanners

754
00:35:48,994 --> 00:35:49,983
but, for all we know

755
00:35:50,028 --> 00:35:52,292
the Dominion could have
cloaking technology.

756
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:54,424
We'll keep our eyes open.

757
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:56,957
l'm telling you, Jake,
we should go to warp.

758
00:35:57,002 --> 00:35:59,300
First, let me get the hang
of flying at impulse.

759
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:01,135
How hard can it be?

760
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:02,401
Are you kidding?

761
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:05,308
You think making course
corrections manually is easy?

762
00:36:05,344 --> 00:36:07,938
But, at this speed, it'll
take weeks to get home.

763
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,380
Actually, it'll
take about five years.

764
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:18,787
Can't we reassemble
the autopilot?

765
00:36:18,824 --> 00:36:20,416
lf Chief O'Brien
taught me anything

766
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:22,654
it's that it's a lot easier
taking things apart

767
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:24,594
than putting them
back together.

768
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,723
Warning. Three ships
coming out of warp.

769
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:28,198
Where? Where?

770
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:29,495
Right there!

771
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:33,360
<i>Mekong</i> to <i>Rio Grande.</i>

772
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:37,572
Hey, Chief, it's me, Jake.

773
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:40,100
Jake, are we glad to find you.

774
00:36:40,145 --> 00:36:41,578
Where's your father?

775
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:43,740
He and Quark
were taken prisoner.

776
00:36:43,782 --> 00:36:46,148
Jake, come to a full stop.

777
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:47,378
l'll beam aboard.

778
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,857
Having trouble
getting it out of orbit?

779
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,021
How'd you know?

780
00:36:58,096 --> 00:37:00,030
Chief, we have to go back
and save my dad.

781
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:01,032
Don't worry, son.

782
00:37:01,066 --> 00:37:02,658
That's exactly
what we're going to do.

783
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:12,409
This is a very
sophisticated device.

784
00:37:12,444 --> 00:37:14,412
Most telepathic
suppressers l've seen

785
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:16,414
have been much bulkier.

786
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:18,473
You know, there might
be a market for this

787
00:37:18,517 --> 00:37:19,484
on the Alpha Quadrant.

788
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:20,542
You're hurting me.

789
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:22,610
l'm sorry, but l don't
have much to work with.

790
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:24,121
You've been at it for hours.

791
00:37:24,156 --> 00:37:27,956
lf you would just stay
still, l'd be... done.

792
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:30,723
All right,
let's get out of here.

793
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:32,252
Stand back.

794
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,343
Quark, move it!

795
00:37:53,852 --> 00:37:55,114
Thanks.

796
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:57,018
You're welcome.

797
00:37:57,122 --> 00:37:58,612
Let's go.

798
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:10,021
Major, l'm picking up something
on forward scanners.

799
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:11,390
<i>Odyssey</i> to runabouts.

800
00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:12,621
Go ahead, <i>Odyssey.</i>

801
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:14,492
We're detecting
three incoming ships

802
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,588
in attack formation.

803
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:17,258
Shields up.
Going to Red Alert.

804
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:18,266
Odo, take the helm.

805
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,824
l'll handle
the targeting controls.

806
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:21,234
Very good.

807
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:23,397
Captain, this is the <i>Rio Grande.</i>

808
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,428
Go ahead.

809
00:38:24,473 --> 00:38:25,906
Half the systems in this ship
are disabled.

810
00:38:25,941 --> 00:38:27,238
l'm going to have
to break formation.

811
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:29,244
Understood.
Return to the wormhole.

812
00:38:29,278 --> 00:38:31,337
We'll try to screen you
from enemy fire.

813
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,177
Well, what about my dad?

814
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:34,944
Captain, l'd like to see
if l can get

815
00:38:35,017 --> 00:38:37,645
close enough to the planet
to locate Commander Sisko.

816
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:39,085
All right,
but you have ten minutes.

817
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:40,645
Then l want you out of there.

818
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:41,781
Enemy ships within range.

819
00:38:41,824 --> 00:38:43,155
Ready to fire at your command.

820
00:38:43,192 --> 00:38:45,888
Runabouts, break formation,
attack pattern delta.

821
00:38:45,928 --> 00:38:48,988
Here they come.

822
00:38:58,674 --> 00:39:02,474
l'm getting casualty reports
from decks 4, 5, 8 and 17.

823
00:39:02,511 --> 00:39:04,911
We also have a plasma leak
in our port nacelle.

824
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:06,244
Deploy damage-control teams.

825
00:39:06,282 --> 00:39:07,249
Aye, sir!

826
00:39:07,283 --> 00:39:08,580
Keogh to runabouts.

827
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:09,584
Go ahead.

828
00:39:09,618 --> 00:39:11,916
They're using some kind
of phased polaron beam

829
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:13,251
to penetrate our shields.

830
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:16,087
Have you tried altering
your harmonics to compensate?

831
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,559
We've run through
the entire spectrum

832
00:39:18,594 --> 00:39:21,392
but none of the frequencies
were effective.

833
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,489
Divert shield power to weapons.

834
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:25,932
We'll give O'Brien
five more minutes.

835
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:27,093
Then we're getting out of here!

836
00:39:27,136 --> 00:39:28,103
Understood.

837
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:29,229
Dax, let's see if we can take

838
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:30,431
some pressure off the <i>Odyssey.</i>

839
00:39:30,473 --> 00:39:31,440
We're with you.

840
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:32,498
Hang on.

841
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:04,696
Wait... stop.

842
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,435
l've got to start using

843
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:08,773
one of those holosuite
exercise programs.

844
00:40:10,613 --> 00:40:12,080
He's slowing us down.

845
00:40:12,114 --> 00:40:13,581
He can hide in the underbrush.

846
00:40:13,616 --> 00:40:16,983
We'll transport him to safety
once we get to your ship.

847
00:40:17,052 --> 00:40:18,986
No, l'm not leaving
him behind.

848
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:20,318
We never would have
gotten away

849
00:40:20,356 --> 00:40:21,755
from the Jem'Hadar
without him.

850
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,485
Thank you, Commander.

851
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:27,121
l'm glad someone around here
appreciates me.

852
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:34,166
Dad!

853
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:37,172
This has turned into some
science project, huh, Jake?

854
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:39,504
Uncle Quark!

855
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:43,000
Nog, you're never going
on a field trip again.

856
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:47,443
Take Eris back
to the passenger compartment

857
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:48,950
and wait there.

858
00:40:48,984 --> 00:40:50,611
Jake...

859
00:40:50,653 --> 00:40:52,644
well done.

860
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:12,363
My controls are dead.

861
00:41:12,408 --> 00:41:14,171
We've lost our sensors!

862
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:15,676
Break off, <i>Mekong.</i>
lnitiate evasive maneuvers.

863
00:41:15,711 --> 00:41:17,736
We'll lay down covering fire.

864
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,940
Acknowledged!

865
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:20,471
<i>Rio Grande</i> to <i>Odyssey.</i>

866
00:41:20,516 --> 00:41:22,143
We've got Sisko.

867
00:41:22,184 --> 00:41:23,651
Well done, Chief.

868
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:25,984
Damage control team
to level 7.

869
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:27,249
Our tactical control
system is down.

870
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:28,449
We've lost all power to phasers.

871
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,219
Bridge to Engineering!

872
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:31,692
Get that port nacelle
back on line.

873
00:41:31,727 --> 00:41:32,785
Aye, sir.

874
00:41:32,828 --> 00:41:35,797
Keogh to runabouts,
we've got what we came for.

875
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:37,321
We'd better fall back
before we...

876
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:40,527
Their communications array
must have been hit.

877
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:42,161
Kira, Dax, you heard him.

878
00:41:42,204 --> 00:41:43,671
Let's get out of here.

879
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:51,009
Major, one
of the Jem'Hadar ships

880
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,672
is making a direct run
at the <i>Odyssey.</i>

881
00:41:52,715 --> 00:41:53,909
Move to intercept.

882
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,911
We were retreating.

883
00:42:25,948 --> 00:42:28,473
There was no need
for a suicide run.

884
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:30,883
They're showing us how far
they're willing to go.

885
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:33,854
Set a course for the wormhole.

886
00:42:46,235 --> 00:42:48,931
Commander, wait.

887
00:42:51,974 --> 00:42:53,942
We need to talk.

888
00:43:01,316 --> 00:43:02,783
l can't believe

889
00:43:02,818 --> 00:43:05,286
l'm on the other side
of the galaxy.

890
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,413
You'll get used to it.

891
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:09,424
Move away from her.

892
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,697
l don't understand.

893
00:43:16,732 --> 00:43:19,496
l've been looking over
this collar of yours.

894
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:21,469
l thought if l replicated it

895
00:43:21,503 --> 00:43:23,903
l might be able
to turn a tidy profit.

896
00:43:23,939 --> 00:43:25,406
lmagine my surprise

897
00:43:25,441 --> 00:43:27,909
when l discovered
there's nothing in here.

898
00:43:27,943 --> 00:43:30,241
lt's just a complicated
locking device.

899
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:33,407
Which means you could have used
your telekinetic abilities

900
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:34,848
at any time.

901
00:43:34,883 --> 00:43:37,181
So the question is,
why didn't you?

902
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:40,188
You seem to already
know the answer.

903
00:43:40,222 --> 00:43:43,157
The Jem'Hadar wanted us
to escape, didn't they?

904
00:43:43,192 --> 00:43:46,821
That was the plan all along--
for us to bring you back here

905
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:49,092
so you could spy
on the Federation.

906
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:50,723
Well done, Commander.

907
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:52,996
You're one of the Founders,
aren't you?

908
00:43:53,035 --> 00:43:55,503
You think the Founders
would waste their time with you?

909
00:43:55,537 --> 00:43:56,902
Constable.

910
00:43:56,939 --> 00:44:00,534
Madam, if you'll come with us.

911
00:44:00,576 --> 00:44:03,101
You have no idea
what's begun here.

912
00:44:06,014 --> 00:44:07,072
Chief!

913
00:44:07,116 --> 00:44:09,050
l'm picking up
a transporter signature

914
00:44:09,084 --> 00:44:10,210
but l can't trace it.

915
00:44:10,252 --> 00:44:12,220
She didn't rematerialize
anywhere on the station

916
00:44:12,254 --> 00:44:13,516
and there are no ships nearby.

917
00:44:13,555 --> 00:44:14,613
Then where is she?

918
00:44:14,656 --> 00:44:15,714
She'll be back.

919
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:17,953
The question is
who she'll bring with her.

920
00:44:18,026 --> 00:44:20,961
lf the Dominion
comes through the wormhole

921
00:44:20,996 --> 00:44:23,362
the first battle
will be fought here

922
00:44:23,398 --> 00:44:26,595
and l intend
to be ready for them.
