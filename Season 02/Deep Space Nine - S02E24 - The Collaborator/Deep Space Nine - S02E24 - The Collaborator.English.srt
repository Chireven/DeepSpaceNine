1
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:45,626
Nerys?

2
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,071
Vedek Bareil.

3
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:49,733
Wanna play?

4
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:54,438
Help me.

5
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:58,306
Please.

6
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,979
All right.

7
00:01:10,162 --> 00:01:11,823
Who is it?

8
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:18,164
lt's Prylar Bek.

9
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:19,794
No, it's not.

10
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:24,275
lt's you.

11
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,753
Good morning.

12
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:01,691
l thought you'd sleep till noon.

13
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:07,294
Shh... you're supposed
to be relaxing.

14
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:10,137
Oh, l'm very relaxed.

15
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:12,301
Good.

16
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:14,403
How are you feeling
this morning?

17
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,311
Oh, miserable.

18
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:19,408
l wish you could
stay here longer.

19
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,011
All right, l will.

20
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,021
l'll stay a few more days.

21
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,114
You know you can't do that.

22
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:27,454
Why not?

23
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:29,255
Because in two days

24
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:32,161
you are going
to be elected kai.

25
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:34,131
Hmm?

26
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:36,065
Oh, that!

27
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,163
You know, there's no guarantee
l'm going to win.

28
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,933
Of course, you're going to win.

29
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:44,464
The people need you.

30
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:50,511
Are you...

31
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,483
going to vote for me?

32
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:55,782
Ho, ho!

33
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,551
ls that why you spent
the last three days here, huh?

34
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,583
To get my vote?

35
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:04,527
Well, l know you don't agree

36
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:07,259
with many of my views,
so l thought

37
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:10,928
a personal appearance
might sway your opinion.

38
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:14,735
l was going to vote
for Vedek Tolena.

39
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:23,777
But l might be persuaded
to change my mind.

40
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:26,716
Good.

41
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:28,013
Because your vote

42
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:30,681
is the only one
that matters to me.

43
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:36,254
l may not always agree

44
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,660
with your interpretations
of the prophecies

45
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:42,929
but l think you will make
a wonderful kai.

46
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,560
Besides, everyone knows

47
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:49,063
that you were Kai Opaka's
personal choice to succeed her.

48
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,412
l could never replace Opaka.

49
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:01,613
Bajor wouldn't have survived
the occupation without her.

50
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,018
Once you become kai

51
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:05,818
we'll never have
these times together.

52
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:07,051
Listen to me.

53
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:12,587
No matter how busy l become,
l will always have time for you.

54
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:14,098
lt won't be easy.

55
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:16,930
l didn't say it would be.

56
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:20,335
l'm not going to lose you,
Nerys.

57
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:22,863
l promise you that.

58
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:30,745
Remember now,
honor the Prophets

59
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:33,478
and they will always love you.

60
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,850
As l understand the sacred texts

61
00:06:35,887 --> 00:06:38,583
the Prophets' love
is unconditional.

62
00:06:38,623 --> 00:06:40,989
They ask nothing in return.

63
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,325
Thank you, Vedek Bareil,
for reminding us

64
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:48,223
how the sacred text can be
so easily misinterpreted.

65
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:51,120
Nothing pleases me more
than providing you

66
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:53,057
with an opposing viewpoint,
Vedek Winn.

67
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:56,257
Somehow you never
fail to do that.

68
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:59,028
l had no idea you
were on the station

69
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:02,161
but perhaps l shouldn't
be so surprised.

70
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:04,763
Oh, l wouldn't even
try to surprise you.

71
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:07,639
l understand you've
been keeping a close eye

72
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:10,076
on my activities
these last few weeks.

73
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:13,808
The eyes of all of Bajor
are focused on you, Bareil.

74
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:16,009
Why should l be any different?

75
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:18,281
After all, the common wisdom

76
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,756
is that you are destined
to be the next kai.

77
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,587
Was that a concession speech?

78
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,717
Hardly.

79
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,660
The choosing is still
two days away.

80
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:30,688
The Prophets may yet
surprise us all.

81
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:32,563
Remember that, Bareil.

82
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,933
l would hate for you to start
celebrating prematurely.

83
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,428
What brings you to the station,
Vedek Winn?

84
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:41,374
My child, if l thought
the Prophets

85
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,741
wanted you to know
the purpose of my visit

86
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:46,110
l would have informed you
of it in advance.

87
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:49,081
Well, now that l know
you're here, l'll be sure

88
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:52,382
to inform Constable Odo
to increase station security.

89
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,115
That won't be necessary.

90
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:55,917
l feel quite safe here.

91
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:59,120
No, it wasn't your safety
that concerned me.

92
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:02,390
Just what are you trying
to infer, child?

93
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,867
l'm sure Major Kira meant
no disrespect.

94
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:08,061
No, not at all.

95
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:10,628
l just want to avoid
the violence

96
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:13,573
that occurred
during your last visit.

97
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:17,408
My child, l know
you still hold me responsible

98
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:21,506
for the deplorable attempt
on Vedek Bareil's life

99
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:23,983
but l can only pray
that some day

100
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:27,977
you will be cured of
this unfortunate misconception.

101
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:30,855
Well, that's one prayer
that will never be answered.

102
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:34,020
What a pity, for both of us.

103
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:38,466
Ooh!

104
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,491
Oh! Excuse me.

105
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:53,807
Uh, excuse me.

106
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:55,281
Don't l know you?

107
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,045
You must be mistaken.

108
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:59,110
No, no, l've seen you before.

109
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:02,248
You're... Kubus, that's it.

110
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,655
Kubus Oak.

111
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,522
You worked for the Cardassians.

112
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,959
Out of my way!

113
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:09,156
Now, you wait a minute!

114
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:11,427
You're not going anywhere.

115
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:15,061
l know who you are,
and l know what you did!

116
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:17,001
You're a traitor!

117
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,903
This is Kubus Oak!

118
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,430
He's a traitor!

119
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:23,842
He worked for the Cardassians!

120
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:25,505
What's going on here?

121
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:27,071
See for yourself.

122
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,418
Secretary Kubus.

123
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:34,479
Last l heard, you were living
on Cardassia.

124
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:37,047
l decided it was time
to come home.

125
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:38,683
Welcome back.

126
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:40,387
You're under arrest.

127
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,977
The Prophets have spoken.

128
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:06,316
All blessings on the new Kai.

129
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:08,788
Blessings on the Kai.

130
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:11,189
May the Prophets guide you.

131
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:22,731
Kai Opaka.

132
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:31,670
Be at peace, my child.

133
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:35,513
You must be strong,
now more than ever.

134
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,314
Why did you leave us?

135
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:41,413
All is as the Prophets
will it to be

136
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:43,720
as you will learn.

137
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,155
Follow me.

138
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:49,719
Be careful, Bareil.

139
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:52,631
The path she walks
is a narrow one.

140
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,897
See that you don't stumble.

141
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:56,801
Heed her words.

142
00:10:56,838 --> 00:11:00,569
But l don't deserve
to walk in your path.

143
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:01,905
You must.

144
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:03,808
lt is your destiny.

145
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:19,087
Prylar Bek?

146
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:24,729
Accept this gift
from the Prophets.

147
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,875
You must not refuse
their offering.

148
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:43,708
Take it, my child.

149
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:45,548
lts venom
will make you stronger.

150
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:15,724
There was quite a mob
gathering out there.

151
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:20,033
l had to call in extra security
to disperse it.

152
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:24,475
l never doubted your ability
to handle the situation, Odo.

153
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,001
You always were good
at your job.

154
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:31,778
l could say the same for you,
Secretary Kubus...

155
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:35,253
special liaison between
the Cardassian occupation forces

156
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,847
and their pawns
in the Bajoran government.

157
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,256
l served the only
recognized government

158
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,192
on Bajor during the occupation.

159
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:44,559
Recognized by the Cardassians.

160
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,588
lf it wasn't for us,
the situation on Bajor

161
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,727
would have been ten times
worse than it was.

162
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,067
Maybe, but l don't see
how you could know that

163
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,336
seeing that you spent nearly all
your time here on the station.

164
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,469
l remember Gul Dukat
telling me once

165
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:01,672
that you were
his favorite Bajoran.

166
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:06,047
Really? Well, l never could
stand that arrogant tyrant!

167
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,245
You hid your feelings well.

168
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,551
lt kept me alive.

169
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,517
Bajor is my home.

170
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:19,720
l never should have left it.

171
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,563
But you did...

172
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,297
and you're going to have
to live with that decision.

173
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,167
This is Major Kira

174
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,006
the highest-ranking Bajoran
on the station.

175
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,478
Then l suppose you're the one
l should be talking to.

176
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,673
Make it brief.

177
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,376
l don't enjoy
talking to collaborators.

178
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,476
l'm not asking you to like me.

179
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,079
l'm simply requesting that l be
allowed to return home.

180
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,485
Your request is denied.

181
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:47,856
l doubt if you have the
authority to make that decision.

182
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,327
The decision has
already been made.

183
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:54,196
ln the llvian Proclamation,
every Bajoran who was a member

184
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,360
of the Cardassian
occupational government

185
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,528
was sentenced to exile.

186
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,165
Your name was number four
on that list.

187
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:06,166
Personally, l think
you all got off too easy.

188
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:11,310
Major...

189
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,250
l'm an old man.

190
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,185
l don't have many years left.

191
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,485
What's the harm of letting me
live them out on Bajor?

192
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:20,548
When the Cardassians needed

193
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:23,891
a new group of Bajorans
to work in the mines

194
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,796
who approved those work orders?

195
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,027
The Bajoran government.

196
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:32,503
Whose signature was
on those authorization forms?

197
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:36,231
Mine.

198
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,572
And you had to know

199
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:39,406
that those authorizations
were death sentences.

200
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:43,039
Did you ever once refuse
to sign them?

201
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,183
No.

202
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,312
And that's why
you can never be allowed

203
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,482
to set foot on Bajor again.

204
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,322
Because, if you do,
it would dishonor

205
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,262
the memory of every person
you sentenced to death.

206
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,442
Vedek Winn.

207
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:21,315
What can l do for you?

208
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,413
Emissary...

209
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,947
it has recently come
to my attention

210
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,825
that there are
some on Bajor who believe

211
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:33,763
that my relationship with you
is not all it should be.

212
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:36,868
Really?

213
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,392
Personally, l find

214
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,871
such a perception,
however inaccurate

215
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,464
to be most distressing.

216
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:45,840
l suppose the question
we have to ask ourselves

217
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:48,937
is whether or not
that perception is inaccurate.

218
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,245
Don't tell me
that you yourself, Emissary

219
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,515
believe that you and l are...

220
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,647
how shall l put it?

221
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,486
Enemies?

222
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,425
At odds.

223
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,555
Well...

224
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,724
let's see.

225
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,395
How could l have come
to such a conclusion?

226
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,701
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

227
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,799
that the last time
you were here at this station

228
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,242
you claimed that l was
a danger to Bajor;

229
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:21,609
that l was here
to destroy your people.

230
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,546
What l was really saying--

231
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:27,416
what l have always maintained--

232
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:31,047
is that you, Emissary, were
sent here by the Prophets

233
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,556
to challenge
our long-held beliefs.

234
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,789
Am l correct in assuming
that you no longer consider

235
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:39,228
the Federation to be
an enemy to Bajor?

236
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,789
Emissary, l admit
l had some concerns

237
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,667
about Bajor's application
for Federation membership

238
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:49,003
but now, l see
that the Federation's

239
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,065
presence here is essential

240
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:54,078
for our long-term
security and growth.

241
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,808
Then, you support the notion
of Bajor joining the Federation?

242
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:00,909
lf that is the will
of the Prophets

243
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:02,681
l would never oppose it.

244
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,983
l'm glad you said that.

245
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:08,185
And l would be grateful

246
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:11,992
if you would tell it
to the Bajoran people.

247
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:17,691
Nothing could make me happier
than to please you, Emissary.

248
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,695
Perhaps you and l could address
the Vedek Assembly together

249
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,506
so everyone can celebrate
our new friendship.

250
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,944
An excellent idea.

251
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:30,812
Perhaps sometime next week.

252
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,044
Why wait, Emissary?

253
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:36,178
l'm sure the Assembly would
grant us an immediate audience.

254
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,620
l'm sure they would.

255
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,523
Unfortunately, if we were
to appear together

256
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,051
in public before the choosing,
it might be misconstrued

257
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:47,325
as an endorsement of your bid
to become the kai.

258
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,925
Oh, l doubt that, Emissary.

259
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,165
lt's common knowledge
that you support Vedek Bareil

260
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,471
although l have been pleasantly
surprised that you haven't made

261
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,067
any public statement
to that effect.

262
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,577
The election of the kai

263
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,479
is strictly
an internal affair to Bajor.

264
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,951
As a Federation officer,
l would never interfere.

265
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,647
What an enlightened philosophy.

266
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,315
So then, it's agreed.

267
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,325
l'll be seeing you
sometime next week.

268
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,452
l look forward to it.

269
00:18:25,676 --> 00:18:27,541
Odo to Major Kira.

270
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:28,602
This is Kira.

271
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:30,477
Sorry to disturb you, Major

272
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:31,674
but l thought you should know

273
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:33,650
that Secretary Kubus
about to leave for Bajor.

274
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,786
How can that be?

275
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:39,289
Vedek Winn has
granted him sanctuary.

276
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:40,688
l'll be right there.

277
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:42,590
Kira to Ops.

278
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:43,684
Go ahead.

279
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:45,389
Dax, has Winn's ship
left the station?

280
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:46,555
Not yet.

281
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,121
l was about to clear them
for departure.

282
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:50,156
Well, keep those docking clamps
locked on.

283
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,761
l don't want that ship going
anywhere until l say so.

284
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:54,395
Understood.

285
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,912
Tell me what happened.

286
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:07,083
Kubus requested a private
meeting with Vedek Winn.

287
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:08,415
They talked for ten minutes

288
00:19:08,452 --> 00:19:10,943
after which, Winn asked
for the use of my computer.

289
00:19:10,988 --> 00:19:13,752
She accessed some information
from the library system.

290
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,053
And?

291
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:18,061
And then she called
the provisional government

292
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:21,428
and informed them she was
granting Kubus sanctuary.

293
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,526
Do you know what she looked up?

294
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:28,595
l'm trying to find
that out right now.

295
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:36,106
Ah...

296
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:37,546
That's Prylar Bek.

297
00:19:37,581 --> 00:19:39,674
Now, why would Winn
be interested

298
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:42,185
in another Bajoran collaborator?

299
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:44,483
l'm not sure.

300
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:47,582
But Bek and Kubus
did know each other.

301
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,683
Bek was the liaison

302
00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:51,320
between the Cardassians
and the Vedek Assembly

303
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:53,660
at the same time
that Kubus was secretary

304
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:54,994
to the occupational government.

305
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:57,762
They spent a lot of time
together on the station.

306
00:19:57,802 --> 00:19:58,769
Hold on a minute.

307
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:00,862
See if Winn accessed
any information

308
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:02,805
about the Kendra Valley
massacre.

309
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:06,741
You're right, she did.

310
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:08,506
Do you think Kubus told her

311
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:10,605
something new
about the massacre?

312
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:12,309
What else is there to know?

313
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:15,011
Kai Opaka's son and 42 other
Bajoran freedom fighters

314
00:20:15,085 --> 00:20:18,020
were ambushed and killed,
because Bek gave the Cardassians

315
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:19,682
the location
of their encampment.

316
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:22,624
He made a full confession
in his suicide note.

317
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,560
Well, you were here then.

318
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:26,324
You must have read it.

319
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:30,992
Major Kira, may l speak
to you, please?

320
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:33,003
Of course.

321
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:46,243
l was told you were the one

322
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:48,444
who stopped
my ship from leaving.

323
00:20:48,485 --> 00:20:49,952
Yes, l did.

324
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:52,751
You know, you're
the last person l would expect

325
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,724
to help a collaborator
like Kubus

326
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:57,454
unless, of course,
he has something you need.

327
00:20:57,494 --> 00:21:00,952
My needs are no concern
of yours, child.

328
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:02,522
Now, l suggest

329
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:05,330
you allow my ship
to depart immediately.

330
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:10,631
Oh, you're free to leave
anytime you like.

331
00:21:10,674 --> 00:21:14,007
Unfortunately, in light
of public feelings about Kubus

332
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:16,239
l can't allow
any ship with him on board

333
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,578
to leave the station
until it's undergone

334
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:20,015
a thorough security check.

335
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:21,881
To prevent sabotage.

336
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,443
And that includes

337
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:26,786
a molecular scan
for nanotechnology.

338
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:29,588
And how long
would such a scan take?

339
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:30,958
Oh, l'm no expert

340
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:35,091
but l'm sure it could
take days... even weeks.

341
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:41,470
Very well.

342
00:21:43,474 --> 00:21:45,806
lt seems the Prophets
have decided

343
00:21:45,843 --> 00:21:48,573
you will have a part
in this, after all.

344
00:21:50,614 --> 00:21:54,050
ln exchange for sanctuary,
Kubus has agreed to provide

345
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:57,053
the name of the man
responsible for the massacre

346
00:21:57,154 --> 00:21:58,382
at Kendra Valley.

347
00:21:58,422 --> 00:22:01,391
Prylar Bek was responsible
for the massacre.

348
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:02,824
Everyone knows that.

349
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,158
Bek was a pawn,
an intermediary.

350
00:22:05,195 --> 00:22:06,457
He killed himself

351
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:09,830
to prevent the discovery
of the real traitor.

352
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:11,300
The real traitor?

353
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:12,632
Bek's superior--

354
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,138
the person
who ordered him to reveal

355
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:18,630
the location of the rebel base
to the Cardassians--

356
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:22,373
the man who was truly
responsible for the massacre--

357
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:24,005
Vedek Bareil.

358
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:36,659
Do you really think l'm going
to let you get away with this?

359
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:38,889
You know, no one's
going to believe

360
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:41,489
the word of a convicted
traitor like Kubus.

361
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:43,864
l never said l believed him.

362
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:48,463
l'm only trying to protect
the spiritual life of Bajor.

363
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:50,268
Don't flatter yourself.

364
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:52,537
You're trying to grab power,
nothing more.

365
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:56,376
My child, do you want
to risk the consequences

366
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:59,871
of having a collaborator
as the next kai?

367
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:02,249
He is not a collaborator.

368
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:04,652
That's yet to be determined.

369
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:08,624
But if he is chosen
and turns out to be guilty

370
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:12,925
the ramifications for Bajor
would be catastrophic.

371
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:16,228
lt would shatter faith
in the authority of the kai

372
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:21,568
and without a strong kai,
Bajor cannot survive.

373
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:25,735
You can't condemn
Bareil without proof.

374
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:27,004
l don't intend to.

375
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:30,547
l was planning to conduct
a quiet investigation

376
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:32,208
when l return to Bajor

377
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:34,342
but l didn't know
whom to trust

378
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:36,512
with such
a delicate assignment--

379
00:23:36,553 --> 00:23:38,987
until now.

380
00:23:39,023 --> 00:23:42,015
You want me to do
your dirty work for you.

381
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,152
All l care about is the truth

382
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:47,027
and l believe the Prophets
have chosen you

383
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:48,395
to help me find it.

384
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:51,401
l'll find out the truth.
Don't worry about that.

385
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:53,960
But l want you to keep
Kubus' accusations

386
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:55,335
from becoming public

387
00:23:55,372 --> 00:23:58,569
until l have a chance
to prove Bareil's innocence.

388
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,304
You have my word.

389
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:03,507
Let the Prophets be my witness.

390
00:24:05,449 --> 00:24:07,713
But if you discover proof
that he's guilty...

391
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:10,652
Whatever l find out,
l will share with you.

392
00:24:12,923 --> 00:24:15,892
Then it's decided.

393
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:19,453
Oh, and, child, one last thing.

394
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:23,796
l know you're
under a terrible strain

395
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,961
but if you're wise

396
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:30,940
you will never speak to me
with such disrespect again.

397
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:46,427
Were you aware at the time

398
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,835
that Prylar Bek was
a collaborator?

399
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:48,963
He wasn't a collaborator.

400
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:50,200
He was only a messenger

401
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,505
between the Cardassians
and the Vedek Assembly.

402
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:55,273
At the time, l could,
l could see

403
00:24:55,312 --> 00:24:57,780
in the weeks
prior to the massacre

404
00:24:57,815 --> 00:25:00,181
that something
was bothering him.

405
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:01,980
He was tense and nervous

406
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:03,748
and he was in
constant communication

407
00:25:03,787 --> 00:25:04,913
with the Vedek Assembly.

408
00:25:05,022 --> 00:25:06,114
Do you know who?

409
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:07,123
Not at the time

410
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:09,091
but the day after the incident

411
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:12,095
Vedek Bareil came
to visit him at the station.

412
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:13,824
Did you see them together?

413
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:16,025
l saw Bareil
enter Bek's quarters

414
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:18,159
which were in the same section
as mine.

415
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:20,170
He was in there
for a couple of hours

416
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:21,432
and at times

417
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:23,565
l could hear shouting
through the bulkhead.

418
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,370
Did you hear
what they were saying?

419
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:28,901
No, but l saw Bareil
when he left the station.

420
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:30,413
He was upset.

421
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:35,851
ln the morning,
Bek hanged himself.

422
00:25:35,886 --> 00:25:37,547
This...

423
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:39,351
is all the evidence you have?

424
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:41,084
Well, isn't that enough?

425
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,650
Bek was obviously
working with Bareil

426
00:25:43,694 --> 00:25:46,925
and when he realized
the enormity of what he'd done

427
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:48,955
he must have wanted to confess.

428
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:50,591
Bareil wouldn't allow it

429
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:53,125
so Bek took the only way out
he had.

430
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,503
That's a fascinating story,
but it is pure conjecture.

431
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,770
There have to be
a dozen explanations

432
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:01,801
for why Bareil
came to see Bek.

433
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:03,142
And it's up to you

434
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,240
to find out which of these
explanations is true.

435
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:12,114
What exactly is it
you're asking me, Nerys?

436
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,224
l guess l'm asking
whether or not

437
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:23,063
you came to the station
to see Bek that day.

438
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,590
l visited Bek, yes.

439
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:27,570
That hardly makes me
a collaborator.

440
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:28,764
l know that.

441
00:26:28,805 --> 00:26:31,831
lt's Vedek Winn
who needs convincing.

442
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,570
Oh, poor Winn.

443
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,569
Her desire to become kai
has clouded her judgment.

444
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:39,582
l wouldn't take her so lightly,
if l were you.

445
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:41,607
She is determined to ruin you.

446
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:45,349
Believe me when l tell you
there's no reason to worry.

447
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:47,949
l had nothing to do
with the massacre

448
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:51,459
and Winn will never
be able to prove otherwise.

449
00:26:51,495 --> 00:26:53,360
All right.

450
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:59,597
But... l still need to know
why you came to the station.

451
00:26:59,636 --> 00:27:04,369
Bek was a deeply troubled man
seeking spiritual guidance.

452
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:07,809
His guilt at betraying
the Kendra Valley base

453
00:27:07,844 --> 00:27:09,141
was overwhelming.

454
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:10,441
He called me for help.

455
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,004
l came as soon as l could.

456
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,040
l only wish l could have done
more for him.

457
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:16,518
What did he tell you
about the massacre?

458
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,282
Nerys, you must understand

459
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:21,621
he was a monk speaking
in confidence to his Vedek.

460
00:27:21,658 --> 00:27:23,489
l cannot betray that trust.

461
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:25,825
l understand.

462
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:30,128
ls there anything else you think
l should know about Bek

463
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:31,828
about the massacre?

464
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:33,893
Nothing that will satisfy Winn.

465
00:27:33,937 --> 00:27:36,497
All right.

466
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,565
l'll keep looking

467
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:40,042
but one way or another

468
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:43,410
l am going to prove to Winn
that you are innocent.

469
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:45,881
Thank you, Nerys.

470
00:27:57,494 --> 00:27:59,394
Ha, just as l thought.

471
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,896
When the Cardassians left

472
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:03,297
they purged all records
of communication

473
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,096
between the station and Bajor.

474
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:07,262
Then we'll just have
to get the information

475
00:28:07,304 --> 00:28:08,566
from the other end.

476
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,300
l'll establish a computer link

477
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,308
with the Bajoran
Central Archives.

478
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:15,505
That way, l can access the files
of the Vedek Assembly.

479
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:26,720
Are you all right?

480
00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:28,224
l'm fine.

481
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:31,386
You don't seem fine.

482
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:33,589
lt's nothing.

483
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,257
Uh-huh.

484
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,199
lf you say so.

485
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:40,294
He says he's not guilty.

486
00:28:40,337 --> 00:28:43,306
l know he's not guilty.

487
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,967
But you're afraid he's guilty.

488
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:48,407
l love him, Odo.

489
00:28:50,914 --> 00:28:52,905
Really?

490
00:28:54,351 --> 00:28:57,912
Well, l, uh...

491
00:28:57,954 --> 00:29:00,115
What?

492
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:02,022
l was just wondering

493
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:05,654
when you were going
to figure that out.

494
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,254
You humanoids.

495
00:29:07,297 --> 00:29:09,162
When it comes
to emotional attachments

496
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:10,894
you never see the obvious.

497
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,902
Ah, l'm into
the Vedek Assembly files.

498
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,438
Can you retrieve
the communication files

499
00:29:16,473 --> 00:29:18,771
between the station
and the Assembly?

500
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:20,333
l'll need a time frame.

501
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:23,608
Uh, try the week leading up
to the Kendra massacre.

502
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:28,341
That's odd.

503
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:30,615
What?

504
00:29:30,654 --> 00:29:33,384
All the communications records
between the Assembly members

505
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:35,220
and Bek for that week
have been sealed.

506
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:36,748
-Sealed? By who?
-lt doesn't say.

507
00:29:36,793 --> 00:29:39,125
lt just indicates
a security seal.

508
00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:40,823
ln the Assembly records?

509
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,094
Who has that kind of authority?

510
00:29:45,235 --> 00:29:47,226
Only a Vedek.

511
00:29:55,278 --> 00:30:00,511
One, two, three, four, five

512
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:07,012
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

513
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:09,952
Okay, okay.

514
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:13,292
Eleven...

515
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,231
Fine, 12, 13, 14.

516
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:20,302
And not a strip more.

517
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:21,998
l hate payday.

518
00:30:25,942 --> 00:30:27,967
Whatever she told you,
l didn't do it.

519
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,545
Relax, Quark.

520
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,412
No one's accusing you
of anything.

521
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:34,144
Eh, the day's still young.

522
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:35,947
Don't be so defensive.

523
00:30:35,986 --> 00:30:37,261
l can't help it.

524
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:38,691
Between the two of you

525
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:40,959
l'm developing
a persecution complex.

526
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:42,828
l'm sorry to hear that.

527
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:45,130
All right.

528
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:48,866
What's going on?

529
00:30:48,906 --> 00:30:52,273
You want something from me,
don't you?

530
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,276
How did you guess?

531
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,436
lt's simple.

532
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,968
We've been here
more than a minute

533
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,139
and we haven't insulted him,
threatened him

534
00:30:58,182 --> 00:30:59,547
or arrested him.

535
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:00,845
Exactly.
So, what is it?

536
00:31:00,884 --> 00:31:03,717
And how much trouble
is it going to cause me?

537
00:31:03,754 --> 00:31:05,221
No trouble at all.

538
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:08,747
We just need you to
bypass a security seal.

539
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:10,623
lsn't that illegal?

540
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:11,923
Oh, spare us.

541
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:13,190
Quark, this is important.

542
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,596
We need access to certain
communication files

543
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:17,156
in the Vedek Assembly records.

544
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:19,931
Perfect-- not only is it
illegal, it's sacrilegious.

545
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,439
l'm sure the Prophets
won't mind just this once.

546
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:24,941
Okay, but l'm going
to have to have

547
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:27,840
written authorization from you,
countersigned by Commander...

548
00:31:27,878 --> 00:31:28,936
Just do it, Quark!

549
00:31:29,046 --> 00:31:31,344
Sure, when things go wrong,
l take the fall!

550
00:31:31,382 --> 00:31:32,713
Nothing is going to go wrong!

551
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,944
That's what you think!

552
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,917
But l happen to be
a firm believer

553
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:37,853
ln Rule of Acquisition
Number 285:

554
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:39,947
''No good deed
ever goes unpunished.''

555
00:31:41,992 --> 00:31:44,085
You can access
the Vedek Assembly records

556
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,619
through the Bajoran
Central Archives.

557
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:48,392
Of course, l can

558
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:51,833
if l wanted to barge in
like some rank amateur.

559
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,468
This is going to take
a little while.

560
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,842
l'll let you know
when l'm done.

561
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:09,815
lt happened right about here.

562
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:13,152
Bek hanged himself in front
of dozens of witnesses.

563
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,487
Caused quite a stir.

564
00:32:14,525 --> 00:32:16,356
At least he had the decency

565
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,327
to feel guilty
about what he'd done.

566
00:32:18,362 --> 00:32:19,659
Strange.

567
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:21,687
Bek and l were
passing acquaintances

568
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:22,858
here on the station.

569
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,731
From what little
l knew about him

570
00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:26,736
l always thought
he was a good man.

571
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,671
A good man does not betray
his own people.

572
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:33,142
The one thing
l've learned about humanoids

573
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:35,611
is that in extreme situations

574
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:40,481
even the best of you are capable
of doing terrible things.

575
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:41,882
Hey.

576
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,546
Hey, Odo.

577
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,281
The good news is

578
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:50,486
l broke through
the security seal.

579
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:53,052
The bad news is,
the file is empty.

580
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,656
All the messages
have been erased.

581
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:04,438
They're erased, all right.

582
00:33:04,475 --> 00:33:06,466
ls there anything
you can do about it?

583
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,501
l could scan
the empty file for traces

584
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:10,137
of recurring data fragments.

585
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,704
There's always a faint residue

586
00:33:11,748 --> 00:33:13,875
of the original data,
if you know where to look.

587
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:15,646
But to unscramble
those fragments

588
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:17,313
so they make
a coherent pattern

589
00:33:17,354 --> 00:33:19,185
could take a while.

590
00:33:19,223 --> 00:33:20,281
So, what you're telling me is

591
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:21,916
we're never going
to retrieve that information.

592
00:33:21,992 --> 00:33:24,483
Well, not in time
to do you any good.

593
00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:26,325
But hold on a second.

594
00:33:26,363 --> 00:33:28,160
Let me see something.

595
00:33:28,198 --> 00:33:30,029
l may not be able
to get you the data

596
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:32,365
but l might be able
to find out who erased it.

597
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:34,063
Their retinal scan
would have been noted

598
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:36,231
by the authorization
subroutine when they logged on.

599
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:38,935
But wouldn't the scans
have been erased, too?

600
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,672
Sure, but even a fragment
of the retinal scan

601
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:43,907
might be enough
to identify the user.

602
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:46,643
Here. l'll run a sweep
of the authorization subroutine

603
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:48,810
see if we can find out anything.

604
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:50,410
Okay.

605
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:52,854
These are
mathematical representations

606
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,619
of a fragment
of the retinal scan.

607
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:58,287
We can use these to reassemble
a portion of the original image.

608
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,391
Not bad.

609
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:04,662
Now we'll cross-reference this
with the Assembly's main archive

610
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:07,670
see if we can find out
who it is.

611
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:18,280
l think we've got something.

612
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:33,224
Blessings on Kai Bareil.

613
00:34:35,966 --> 00:34:38,867
You.

614
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:42,338
l trusted you.

615
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,499
l needed you.

616
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,374
And you let me die.

617
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,997
You will be rewarded.

618
00:35:19,343 --> 00:35:22,437
Accept this gift
from the Prophets.

619
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:46,860
May the Prophets
comfort you, my child.

620
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:49,030
May they comfort us all.

621
00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:09,692
Come in.

622
00:36:13,897 --> 00:36:15,990
Nerys.

623
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:19,469
Did you really believe
l wouldn't learn the truth?

624
00:36:19,503 --> 00:36:24,202
The truth is not
always easy to recognize.

625
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:26,209
l recognize it now

626
00:36:26,243 --> 00:36:28,905
and l don't like what l see.

627
00:36:30,747 --> 00:36:32,214
Why did you do it?

628
00:36:32,249 --> 00:36:36,345
Why did you erase
those transmission records?

629
00:36:36,386 --> 00:36:39,583
Don't make me do this.

630
00:36:39,623 --> 00:36:41,557
l don't have any choice.

631
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:44,219
Winn is waiting to hear from me.

632
00:36:44,261 --> 00:36:46,456
Do you really want me
to tell her

633
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,794
that you ordered Bek
to give the Cardassians

634
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,595
the location
of that resistance base?

635
00:36:50,634 --> 00:36:53,102
That you are responsible

636
00:36:53,136 --> 00:36:56,162
for the deaths
of those 43 people?

637
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:02,075
That you killed Kai Opaka's son?

638
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:14,455
The Cardassians were determined

639
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:18,257
to eliminate all resistance
in the Kendra Valley.

640
00:37:18,295 --> 00:37:22,391
lf someone hadn't told them
the location of that base

641
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:26,459
they would have wiped out
every village in the area.

642
00:37:26,503 --> 00:37:30,303
That would have meant the death
of 1,200 innocent Bajorans.

643
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:34,454
l could not allow that.

644
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:37,181
There had to have been
another way.

645
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:43,953
l believed in you...

646
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:47,728
l defended you

647
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,759
and Winn was right all along.

648
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,640
And now she's going
to destroy you.

649
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:58,610
No.

650
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:02,843
l've destroyed myself.

651
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,593
What's our status?

652
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,257
Everything is under control.

653
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,426
You received
a subspace transmission

654
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,731
from Vedek Winn.

655
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,670
She seemed anxious
to talk to you.

656
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:27,798
Open a channel
to the Vedek Assembly.

657
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,239
Put it on monitor seven.

658
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:31,300
l might as well
get this over with.

659
00:38:34,847 --> 00:38:38,374
l was wondering
when you'd contact me, child.

660
00:38:38,418 --> 00:38:40,978
l was waiting to complete
my investigation.

661
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,183
l must congratulate you
on a job well done.

662
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:47,852
l knew the Prophets were right
in picking you to assist me.

663
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:50,452
You sound like you already know
what l'm going to tell you.

664
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:51,622
Oh, but l do.

665
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:54,633
Bareil has just made
a surprise announcement

666
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:55,793
to the Vedek Assembly.

667
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:57,962
He's withdrawn himself
from the choosing.

668
00:38:58,004 --> 00:39:01,496
He no longer wishes
to be the next kai.

669
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:03,805
l know this is painful
for you, child

670
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,073
but you've done a great service
for all of Bajor.

671
00:39:07,113 --> 00:39:11,072
Whoever is chosen
tomorrow as the new kai

672
00:39:11,117 --> 00:39:14,052
will owe you
a debt of gratitude.

673
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:16,612
May the Prophets guide you.

674
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:44,374
Are you all right?

675
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:45,850
lt doesn't make sense.

676
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:47,853
Vedek Bareil is
an honorable man.

677
00:39:47,954 --> 00:39:50,388
He wouldn't hide
from the consequences

678
00:39:50,423 --> 00:39:52,618
of his actions
by covering them up.

679
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,854
l'm missing something.

680
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:56,394
Chief.

681
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:59,626
l need to get back into
the Vedek Assembly archives.

682
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,657
Yes, sir.

683
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:49,477
Kai Winn.

684
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:55,776
Your <i>pagh</i> is strong, my child.

685
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:57,915
Be at peace.

686
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,551
ln time, you will learn
l am not your enemy.

687
00:41:01,594 --> 00:41:03,858
l hope that's true.

688
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:06,591
l know you do.

689
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,793
Oh, and tell Commander Sisko

690
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:13,272
l must postpone appearing
with him before the Assembly.

691
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:14,705
At least for now.

692
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,760
Nerys?

693
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,394
l didn't expect
to see you here.

694
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:46,428
You forgot to erase
the transit files.

695
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:50,769
l'm not sure l understand
what you mean.

696
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:54,439
Oh, you did a wonderful job
erasing the transmission reports

697
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,176
but you forgot
all about the transit files

698
00:41:57,216 --> 00:41:59,707
the files that prove
you weren't a collaborator.

699
00:42:01,988 --> 00:42:04,218
lt's over.

700
00:42:04,257 --> 00:42:06,282
Let it rest.

701
00:42:06,325 --> 00:42:08,190
The people have chosen Winn.

702
00:42:08,227 --> 00:42:11,856
Only because you withdrew
and you didn't have to.

703
00:42:11,898 --> 00:42:13,525
The transit reports clearly show

704
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:15,500
you were on a personal retreat

705
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:18,003
at the Dakeen Monastery
during the week

706
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:19,334
leading up to the massacre.

707
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:21,499
l checked the Dakeen
transmission reports.

708
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,975
You had contact with no one

709
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,570
except one transmission
after the massacre

710
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:28,739
ordering you back
to the Vedek Assembly.

711
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:29,873
That's enough.

712
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,440
No, it is not enough.

713
00:42:32,485 --> 00:42:36,251
There is no way you ordered Bek

714
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:40,123
to reveal the location of
the Kendra Valley encampment.

715
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,821
You were covering up
for someone else.

716
00:42:42,862 --> 00:42:46,457
Someone who meant more
to you than me.

717
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:48,763
More to you even
than becoming kai.

718
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:51,463
Please, Nerys, don't.

719
00:42:51,504 --> 00:42:52,869
Why not?

720
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:55,635
lt's the truth, isn't it?

721
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,279
Who else meant that much to you?

722
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:02,577
lt had to be Kai Opaka.

723
00:43:02,615 --> 00:43:07,314
Opaka knew where the resistance
cell was located...

724
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:12,154
because her son was a member.

725
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:17,160
She was the collaborator,
wasn't she?

726
00:43:17,196 --> 00:43:22,793
She sacrificed her own son
to save 1,000 people.

727
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:25,326
l had to protect her.

728
00:43:30,877 --> 00:43:32,344
So...

729
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,480
instead of you,
we have Winn to lead us.

730
00:43:38,517 --> 00:43:41,179
lt is the will of the Prophets.

731
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:44,679
The question is...

732
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:48,452
where will she lead us?

733
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:53,223
Down paths she cannot
possibly imagine.

734
00:43:53,266 --> 00:43:56,599
She's going to need
our help along the way

735
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:59,469
even if she doesn't
realize it yet.

736
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,840
What happens to us?

737
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:05,275
What do you want to happen?

738
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:20,314
Let's go pay our respects
to the new Kai.
