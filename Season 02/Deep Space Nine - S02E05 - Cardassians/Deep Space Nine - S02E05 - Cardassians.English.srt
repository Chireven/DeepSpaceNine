1
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:15,565
Ah.

2
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:17,370
Tarkalean tea again, Doctor?

3
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:19,400
Yes, and you're drinking
Rokassa juice

4
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:20,411
aren't you, Garak?

5
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:21,503
How did you know?

6
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:23,138
The odor is unmistakable.

7
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:25,843
So it is.

8
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:29,684
Rokassa juice soothes my nerves.

9
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:32,815
l had a very demanding
customer today--

10
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:37,022
a Bajoran engineer who comes
to the shop constantly

11
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:38,051
just to plague me.

12
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:39,757
You know, l've always
wondered about that--

13
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:41,527
about who your steady
customers really are.

14
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:43,534
l can't imagine Bajorans
frequenting a shop

15
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:44,728
run by a Cardassian.

16
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,136
l like to think
that my expertise

17
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,935
and willingness to serve

18
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:53,343
overcome any general resentment
any of my clientele may have.

19
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:55,403
Ah... and perhaps
your expertise

20
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:57,005
and willingness to serve

21
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:59,882
go so far as to establish
a certain... trust

22
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:01,749
between you and your customers?

23
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:03,277
Trust is very important.

24
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:08,055
And once they trust you,
they're much more open with you

25
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:10,152
and they tell you things.

26
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:14,596
Really, Doctor, must we
always play this game?

27
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:17,830
l'm no more a spy
than you are...

28
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,063
A doctor.

29
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,503
l'm afraid

30
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,905
you really do allow
your imagination

31
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:24,340
to run away with you.

32
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,708
What else can l say
to finally convince you

33
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:28,372
that l'm just...

34
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:30,472
Plain, simple Garak?

35
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:31,573
Precisely.

36
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:36,414
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

37
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:43,326
There's a table.

38
00:01:45,197 --> 00:01:46,391
Have a seat.

39
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:48,899
l'll get us all
some refreshment.

40
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,807
Well, that was odd.

41
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:01,972
Do you know him?

42
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:03,275
On the contrary.

43
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:06,341
l've never seen him before
in my life.

44
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,278
l hope l'm not intruding

45
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:11,789
but l couldn't help
noticing what a...

46
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:14,758
what a handsome young man
you have here.

47
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,696
l'm sorry l'm late.

48
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,104
The damnedest thing
just happened.

49
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:34,335
Garak the tailor was attacked.

50
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,364
Attacked where?

51
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,377
At the Replimat.

52
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:37,708
He was bitten on the hand.

53
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,542
Another unsatisfied customer?

54
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,845
He always cuts
the pants too long.

55
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:44,716
Actually, it was a boy--
a Cardassian boy.

56
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:45,741
l wasn't aware we had

57
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,652
any Cardassian children
on the station.

58
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,384
We don't.

59
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:51,119
He's just arrived
on a Bajoran transport

60
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:53,353
with an adult Bajoran
who says he's his father.

61
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,089
The boy was probably

62
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,563
one of the orphans left behind
when the Cardassians pulled out.

63
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,226
We had no choice
but to take care of them.

64
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:02,031
You have an incoming
subspace transmission

65
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,833
from Cardassia, Commander.

66
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,668
lt's Gul Dukat.

67
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:07,299
ln my office.

68
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,442
Commander, it's been brought
to my attention

69
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:19,544
that the sole Cardassian
living on your station

70
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,077
has been assaulted.

71
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:24,454
l'm surprised how quickly
the news reached you, Dukat.

72
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,289
l only heard about it myself
a minute ago.

73
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,056
Well, is it true he was attacked

74
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:31,827
by a Cardassian boy brought
to the station by a Bajoran?

75
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,528
A Cardassian boy appears
to be involved, yes.

76
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,637
Exactly as l feared.

77
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:40,869
Exactly as l've been
warning my colleagues.

78
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:43,274
Warning them?

79
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,871
Cardassian war orphans,
Commander.

80
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:48,211
Abandoned when we left Bajor.

81
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:49,807
lt's a disgrace

82
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:52,820
and obviously, these
children are being raised

83
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,378
to hate their own kind.

84
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:55,946
This incident is proof.

85
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,925
You're assuming a lot
from one incident.

86
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,984
Am l?

87
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:03,395
Then why would this boy
attack poor Garak?

88
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:06,161
An amiable fellow,
if ever there was one.

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,430
lf you'd like,
l'll try to find out.

90
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:11,063
That would be most
appreciated, Commander.

91
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:14,699
l need to find out everything
l can about this boy

92
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:19,179
so that l can use his story in
my fight to bring these orphans

93
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,805
back to their homeland.

94
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,076
This is a tragedy

95
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:26,051
that all of Cardassia is
going to have to address.

96
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,850
We didn't come here
to cause trouble.

97
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,553
Has this Garak
filed a complaint?

98
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,254
No, but the Cardassian officials

99
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:36,229
asked that we look
into the incident.

100
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:37,731
l wish they'd shown
as much concern

101
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,359
as when they left my boy
and dozens like him

102
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,993
to fend for themselves.

103
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,264
How did you come to adopt him?

104
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:45,465
My wife and l felt that Rugal
shouldn't suffer

105
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,030
for crimes committed by others.

106
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:48,770
But why would he attack
another Cardassian?

107
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,938
That Cardassian should have
minded his own business.

108
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,776
Garak was only trying
to be friendly.

109
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:56,283
The boy seemed terrified
of him on sight.

110
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:58,615
The Cardassians are suggesting
that the Bajorans

111
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:01,121
are raising these orphans
to hate their own people.

112
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,214
To hate Cardassians?

113
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,954
lt shouldn't be too hard,
should it?

114
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,724
We told him the truth,
Commander.

115
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:14,758
The truth about what Cardassia
did to Bajor.

116
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,269
He needed to know.

117
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:19,102
And for that,
l make no apologies.

118
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:26,743
To us... he isn't even
one of them anymore.

119
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:30,046
He isn't Cardassian.

120
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,109
He's Bajoran.

121
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:41,926
And we love him

122
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:45,421
just as if he was
our own flesh and blood.

123
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,305
All right, here we go.

124
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:55,331
Here we go.

125
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:58,368
Come on now, baby, come on.

126
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:03,913
Dabo!

127
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:15,053
There's nothing quite so
depressing as a winning streak

128
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:16,791
that won't stop streaking.

129
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,059
Dabo!

130
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,293
Oh...

131
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:26,073
lt would appear as if

132
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:27,734
you have this game
all figured out.

133
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:30,437
Dabo!

134
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,072
Dabo is a passion of mine.

135
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:36,042
l remember you.
You're Doctor...

136
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,072
Bashir.

137
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:38,085
Bashir, yes.

138
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,086
How's the Cardassian?

139
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,485
Still has all his fingers,
l presume.

140
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,216
Yes... luckily there
were no broken bones.

141
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,223
l've never seen a boy

142
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:45,225
take a bite out of a man's hand
like that.

143
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:46,658
He's a strange boy, Rugal.

144
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,423
Do you know the family well?

145
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:49,487
Dabo!

146
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,656
Do you?

147
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,098
Look, this is really
none of my business.

148
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,429
Well, you were a witness.

149
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:57,632
l just want to get my facts
right for the medical report.

150
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:01,164
l'd really rather
you asked someone else.

151
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,268
Frankly, l don't
understand your attitude.

152
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:05,176
All l asked
was if you know them well.

153
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:06,646
Well enough.

154
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,017
l heard the father was
looking for a new job

155
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,783
several months ago,
and l offered to help.

156
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:17,814
l visited them on Bajor
several times.

157
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:20,020
Did you find anything troubling?

158
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:23,861
lt must be torture for that boy,
living like that.

159
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:27,390
Hated by people he thinks
of as his parents.

160
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:31,371
Told day after day,
he's worthless Cardassian scum.

161
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,067
Beaten if he even
looks the wrong way.

162
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,336
Rugal is their revenge--

163
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:40,108
their revenge against
all Cardassians.

164
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:47,612
lt is not true.

165
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:48,747
lt is not true!

166
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,279
Rugal will tell you.

167
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,258
We have not mistreated him.

168
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:53,920
ls this some Cardassian...

169
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:57,795
There will be ample opportunity
to go over the matter in detail

170
00:09:57,832 --> 00:10:00,858
but during the investigation,
we'd like for Rugal

171
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:03,871
to stay with our schoolteacher,
Mrs. O'Brien.

172
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:05,839
She's expecting him now.

173
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:09,069
What if l refuse?

174
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,271
Then l'll have
to call security

175
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:14,372
and have them remove him
from your quarters.

176
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:17,111
l don't think either
of us wants that.

177
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,391
Why?

178
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,124
lt will be all right.

179
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:32,631
l didn't do anything wrong!

180
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,794
l know, l know.

181
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,826
lt will be all right.

182
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,944
l didn't do anything wrong.

183
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,413
Nobody's accusing you
of a crime, Rugal.

184
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,040
You're not being arrested.

185
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,551
My name is Commander Sisko.

186
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:54,350
l believe you already
know Dr. Bashir.

187
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,622
Hello, Rugal.

188
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,847
l'm sure all of this

189
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,755
will be straightened out
in a day or two.

190
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:02,159
lf you want to visit with
your father tomorrow, you can.

191
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,958
Go on, Rugal.

192
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,522
We'll talk tomorrow.

193
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,303
They won't hurt you.

194
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,533
They're humans.

195
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,008
They're not Cardassians.

196
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,098
Actually, something good did
come out of all of this, Garak.

197
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,106
Oh?

198
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,198
lf it hadn't happened

199
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,868
we'd never have discovered
Rugal's situation.

200
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,103
And a bite on the hand
is certainly

201
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,838
worth saving a boy's
life, wouldn't you say?

202
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,370
l suppose it depends
on whose hand.

203
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,508
Just joking, Doctor.

204
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,415
Perhaps it might
even help Gul Dukat

205
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,714
in his efforts to resolve

206
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,551
the entire war orphan
predicament.

207
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,147
l beg your pardon?

208
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,493
Gul Dukat.

209
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,961
He called Commander Sisko
right after this happened.

210
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:13,454
Apparently, he was quite
concerned with your well-being.

211
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,728
You never mentioned

212
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:15,792
you were friends.

213
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:22,707
You said Dukat is doing
something about war orphans?

214
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,676
He wants to bring them
all home from Bajor.

215
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,736
Does he?

216
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,772
Am l missing something?

217
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,046
Tell me, Doctor...

218
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,918
is there a single trait
you would ascribe

219
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,252
to me and my fellow Cardassians?

220
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:42,421
Would it not be
our attention to detail?

221
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:46,455
Do you think we simply forgot

222
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,059
about those poor little orphans
when we left Bajor?

223
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:54,836
Do you think they simply
slipped from our minds?

224
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,069
And who, would you guess

225
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,241
was in charge of the Cardassian
withdrawal from Bajor?

226
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,142
l don't know how to thank you.

227
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,348
Don't thank me too quickly,
Dukat.

228
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,654
The boy could be returned
to his adoptive parents.

229
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:16,253
After the accusations
this businessman has made...

230
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,457
That's all it is for the moment,
an accusation.

231
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,295
We would not take kindly

232
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,496
to the boy being returned
to the Bajorans.

233
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,663
However, l have
complete confidence

234
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,299
in your ability to be thorough,
Commander.

235
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,400
And if there's
anything l can do...

236
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,240
As a matter of fact, there is.

237
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,611
lf it is decided the boy is
to be returned to Cardassia

238
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,343
to whom would we return him?

239
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,782
lt might help to find out

240
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,843
if he still has
any living relatives.

241
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,013
l was going to suggest

242
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,387
that you forward us
a sample of the boy's DNA

243
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,949
and we'll run it through
our data banks immediately.

244
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,984
We'll send it right away.

245
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,393
Excuse me, Gul Dukat.

246
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,930
l have a question.

247
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:58,597
Doctor... Bashir, isn't it?

248
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,866
Yes. lsn't it true

249
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,807
that you were in charge
of the evacuation of Bajor?

250
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,901
Yes, l was.

251
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,742
Then it would have been
your responsibility to ensure

252
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,544
that these orphans were,
in fact, part of that evacuation

253
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,710
yet you chose
to leave them behind.

254
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,083
Why?

255
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:20,051
l did not choose to leave
them behind, Doctor.

256
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,686
l was ordered
to leave them behind.

257
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,197
Ordered.

258
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,698
By whom?

259
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,394
By the civilian leaders...

260
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,401
Excuse me...

261
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,402
but, if l understand

262
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,301
the Cardassian political
system correctly

263
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,203
civilian leaders
have no direct authority

264
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,298
over military officers.

265
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,036
Who's been tutoring you

266
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,772
in Cardassian
social studies, Doctor?

267
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,244
Your old friend, Garak.

268
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:48,516
Well, then perhaps you should
remind my old friend Garak

269
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,580
the withdrawal of Bajor
was a decision

270
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:56,061
made by the civilian leaders--
one which l clearly opposed.

271
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:00,759
And yes, they made the decision
to leave the orphans behind

272
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,497
a decision
l've regretted ever since.

273
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,528
Thank you for your concern,
Doctor.

274
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,132
Good day, Commander.

275
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,778
He's lying.

276
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:16,578
ls that an opinion, or do you
have evidence to support it?

277
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:17,583
l have Garak.

278
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:18,584
Garak?

279
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,585
He seems to think

280
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,053
there's more going on here
than we realize.

281
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,885
What exactly
does he think is going on?

282
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,824
l'm not sure.

283
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:31,387
He doesn't actually tell me
what he really thinks.

284
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,991
l sort of have to deduce it.

285
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:38,868
Ah, so, you deduced that Garak
thinks Dukat is lying

286
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,770
about something
you're not sure of

287
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:44,971
and you proceeded to interrupt
my conversation to confront him

288
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,002
about whatever that might be.

289
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,570
l'm sorry, Commander.

290
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,775
lt just seemed an opportune...

291
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:51,977
Don't apologize.

292
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:55,749
lt's been the high point
of my day.

293
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,688
Don't do it again.

294
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:01,558
Why would Garak
want to undermine Gul Dukat?

295
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:02,561
l'm not really sure.

296
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,654
l don't think he likes
Gul Dukat very much.

297
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:08,030
l'd like to ask Garak
about this myself.

298
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,764
Have him in my office
at 2100 hours.

299
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,795
Yes, sir.

300
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,186
Hi.

301
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,209
Hi.

302
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,846
Here, let me.

303
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:30,878
Oh, thanks.

304
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,223
Good idea.

305
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,058
What?

306
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,290
Well, three settings.

307
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,425
l assume you sent Molly over
to stay with the Fredericks.

308
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,991
She's asleep.

309
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,266
She and Rugal
played all afternoon.

310
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,362
He wore her out.

311
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,702
You let them play together?

312
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,075
Why not?

313
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,513
The boy almost bit
somebody's hand off.

314
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,950
l was with them all afternoon.

315
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,385
He's not like that.

316
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,252
He's really very gentle.

317
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,554
''Gentle'' was bred out of these
Cardassians a long time ago.

318
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,083
You know...

319
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,760
that was a very ugly thing
you just said.

320
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,234
l only said...

321
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,396
l don't need to hear it twice.

322
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,837
Rugal, dinner's ready.

323
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,840
l hope you like it...

324
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,061
Keiko...

325
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,868
darling, what is it?

326
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,069
l found some Cardassian recipes

327
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,978
in the memory bank
of our food replicator.

328
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,627
lt's a stew

329
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,786
made with Cardassian
<i>zabo</i> meat.

330
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,430
l thought Rugal might enjoy

331
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:14,734
a dish that's popular
on his own world.

332
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:24,898
Can't sleep?

333
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:27,570
What are they going
to do with me?

334
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:29,239
Oh, l'm not sure.

335
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,080
You might have something
to say about that, you know.

336
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:36,484
You should be telling
Commander Sisko what you want.

337
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:39,649
l want to go home.

338
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,987
Well, he'll understand that.

339
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:42,389
You're a Cardassian

340
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:45,520
and they should have taken
you home when they left.

341
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:47,997
No, l mean home.

342
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:49,465
To Bajor.

343
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,677
lt must be tough for you.

344
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:04,010
You know, living on Bajor?

345
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:05,515
Why?

346
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,017
Being Cardassian.

347
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:09,212
That's not my fault!

348
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:11,448
l was born that way.

349
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:13,354
That's not what l meant.

350
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:16,918
There's nothing wrong
with being a Cardassian.

351
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:18,929
Yes, there is.

352
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:22,364
Who taught you that?

353
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,799
lt's the truth.

354
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:25,666
Everybody knows it.

355
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:30,903
How do your parents
feel about Cardassians?

356
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:32,671
They hate them.

357
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,908
Why would you want to live
with someone who hates you?

358
00:20:36,948 --> 00:20:40,714
They hate other Cardassians,
not me.

359
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:43,151
My parents have never
done anything wrong to me.

360
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:46,054
Oh, come on,
even l got my bottom

361
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:49,058
whacked by my dad once or twice.

362
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:50,855
Not me.

363
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:55,264
My parents follow
the teachings of the Prophets.

364
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:58,200
What do you think
of Cardassians?

365
00:20:58,236 --> 00:20:59,567
Me?

366
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:04,936
Well, l... l can't say, really.

367
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:07,001
Why not?

368
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:11,810
Well, you can't judge
a whole race of people.

369
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:16,650
You can't hate all Cardassians
or all Klingons

370
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:18,211
or all humans.

371
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:21,020
l've met some Cardassians
l didn't like.

372
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,616
And l've met some l did.

373
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,492
Like you.

374
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:32,501
Do you know how many Bajorans
the Cardassians murdered

375
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:34,128
during the occupation?

376
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:35,604
Over ten million.

377
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,074
We had a test on it in school.

378
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:42,474
l wish l wasn't Cardassian.

379
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:07,630
Come, Doctor, get dressed.

380
00:22:07,672 --> 00:22:09,902
We need to be going.

381
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:11,340
Going?

382
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,536
Going where?

383
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:16,307
To Bajor.

384
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:20,611
l assume this couldn't wait
until morning?

385
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:21,879
No, sir, l...

386
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,580
l need to use a runabout.

387
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:25,919
l'm waiting.

388
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:29,618
lt's Garak, sir.

389
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,355
He wants to go to Bajor.

390
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:33,556
Bajor? For what?

391
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:36,389
He wouldn't tell me.

392
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:39,369
Well, by all means.

393
00:22:39,403 --> 00:22:41,303
Will one runabout be enough?

394
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:43,398
Ops to Sisko.

395
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:44,738
Go ahead.

396
00:22:44,775 --> 00:22:47,300
Commander, there's an urgent
communication for you

397
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:48,573
from Gul Dukat.

398
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,813
l'm sorry to disturb you
at such a late hour, Commander

399
00:22:59,857 --> 00:23:02,985
but thanks to the DNA gene type
you sent us

400
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:06,224
we've discovered the boy
is actually the son

401
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:10,222
of one of our most prominent
politicians-- Kotran Pa'Dar.

402
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:11,996
When was Pa'Dar on Bajor?

403
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:14,003
Over eight years ago.

404
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:17,199
He was Exarch for a Cardassian
settlement there

405
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:19,675
and the boy was believed
to have died

406
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,769
in a Bajoran terrorist attack.

407
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:23,780
Has he been told
his son is alive?

408
00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:24,838
Of course!

409
00:23:24,882 --> 00:23:27,646
As you can imagine,
he's overwhelmed with joy.

410
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:30,984
He's already on his way
to the station to reclaim him.

411
00:23:31,022 --> 00:23:33,115
lt's not that simple.

412
00:23:33,157 --> 00:23:34,624
l don't understand.

413
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:36,819
The boy wants
to go back to Bajor.

414
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:38,590
Back?

415
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:41,291
To live
with the same brutal people?

416
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:43,800
l can't find any evidence
to support that accusation.

417
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:46,496
l can't even find the man
who made it in the first place.

418
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:47,504
Well, nevertheless

419
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:50,598
once the boy finds out
his real father's alive

420
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,632
surely he'll change his mind.

421
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:55,372
And even if he doesn't, it would
be in the boy's best interests.

422
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:56,675
We'll just have to see

423
00:23:56,714 --> 00:23:58,705
what happens
when Pa'Dar gets here.

424
00:23:58,749 --> 00:24:00,046
Sisko out.

425
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:02,917
lt can't be just
a coincidence, sir.

426
00:24:02,953 --> 00:24:04,784
Garak must have heard
about Pa'Dar

427
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:05,982
before he woke me up.

428
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:09,652
What could he be
looking for on Bajor?

429
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:11,888
There's only one way
to find out.

430
00:24:29,713 --> 00:24:33,342
Excuse me, is this the Tozhat
Resettlement Center?

431
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:34,681
Yes.

432
00:24:34,718 --> 00:24:37,016
l'm Dr. Bashir
from Federation Command

433
00:24:37,121 --> 00:24:38,611
at Deep Space 9.

434
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,886
l've been trying to find
some information

435
00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:42,552
on a Cardassian war orphan

436
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:44,959
who was apparently placed
for adoption here.

437
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:47,020
Yes, the Bajorans have
opened their hearts

438
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:48,531
to many abandoned children.

439
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:50,693
The boy's name was Rugal

440
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:53,794
and the Bajoran who adopted him
was named Proka Migdal.

441
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:56,136
l don't recognize
either of the names.

442
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:59,233
What was it you were trying
to find out about them?

443
00:24:59,276 --> 00:25:03,885
Yes... exactly what are we
trying to find out about them?

444
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:07,545
The circumstances surrounding
the young man's adoption.

445
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:09,954
lt took place
about eight years ago.

446
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:11,959
The Cardassians were still here.

447
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:13,460
You'll never find anything
from back then.

448
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:14,518
Oh, the Cardassians

449
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:16,928
are quite meticulous
record keepers, madam.

450
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:19,934
They've taught many worlds,
including this one

451
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:21,333
how to keep records.

452
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,200
l find it difficult to believe

453
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:25,432
that none exist
from that period.

454
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:29,239
Certainly computer entries
were made on a regular basis.

455
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,938
l wouldn't know.

456
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:31,968
l wasn't a volunteer then.

457
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:32,978
l was in the underground.

458
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:34,639
Really?

459
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:37,344
Perhaps we have met.

460
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:39,876
Look, can we just
check your computers?

461
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:41,684
Our computers don't work.

462
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:44,089
l can't get a technician
to come out.

463
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,218
We're not exactly
a top priority.

464
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,525
Perhaps l can be of service.

465
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,397
You can fix computers?

466
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:58,166
Oh, l dabble with isolinear
data subprocessors.

467
00:25:58,206 --> 00:26:00,436
lt's... a hobby of mine.

468
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,775
l continue
to underestimate you, Garak.

469
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:09,510
Oh, it's no more difficult

470
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,848
than sewing on a button,
actually.

471
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:13,080
Excuse me.

472
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:16,049
You carry this
everywhere with you, do you?

473
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,648
A simple tailoring tool.

474
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:19,455
You'd be surprised how often

475
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,689
someone needs
their pants let out.

476
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:22,855
Oh, it's not there.

477
00:26:22,897 --> 00:26:24,387
What's not there?

478
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:26,400
Rugal's name, his father's
name-- none of it.

479
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:28,698
You managed to find eight-
year-old files that quickly?

480
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,703
Oh, it's simply a question

481
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:31,295
of knowing what you're
looking for, Doctor.

482
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,431
Excuse me.

483
00:26:32,473 --> 00:26:33,963
Now, it's either been misfiled

484
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:35,235
or under a wrong name

485
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:37,972
or this is entirely
the wrong resettlement center.

486
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:40,173
l'm not going to another
district until l know...

487
00:26:40,214 --> 00:26:42,409
That won't be necessary.

488
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,975
We can access the files
to this entire province

489
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:47,180
from here and download
them into a data clip.

490
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:49,121
But that'll be
thousands of files.

491
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:51,216
Tens of thousands, actually.

492
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:04,803
Excuse me, sir.

493
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:07,740
Have you come to take us
back to Cardassia?

494
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:12,168
l'm afraid not, child.

495
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,544
Come, Doctor.

496
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:17,379
l believe you'll find
your computer system

497
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,283
fully functional now, madam.

498
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:39,264
Computer, set up a data bank

499
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,798
cross-referencing
age groups, sex

500
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:43,640
year of adoption...

501
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:47,944
Computer, disregard that request
and shut down all engines.

502
00:27:52,653 --> 00:27:55,713
l'm sorry you're upset
about the orphans.

503
00:27:57,758 --> 00:27:59,658
Children without parents

504
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:02,185
have no status
in Cardassian society.

505
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,425
The situation
is most unfortunate

506
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:06,330
but l don't make the rules.

507
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:09,359
But you do play the game,
don't you, Garak?

508
00:28:09,403 --> 00:28:10,927
And there is a game being played

509
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:12,701
right now as we speak,
isn't there?

510
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,038
There are always games, Doctor.

511
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:17,510
The trouble is,
l don't have the slightest idea

512
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:20,844
what this game is all about.

513
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,645
So you're going to tell me
what's going on

514
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:24,446
inside that plain
and simple head of yours

515
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:25,611
my Cardassian friend

516
00:28:25,653 --> 00:28:27,917
or we're going to sit here
until we rot.

517
00:28:27,955 --> 00:28:31,118
Tell me, Doctor...

518
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:34,560
why do you think
the Cardassians left Bajor?

519
00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:38,793
Gul Dukat said it was a decision
made by your civilian leaders.

520
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,767
And isn't it interesting

521
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:44,464
that one of Cardassia's
most notable civilian leaders

522
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:46,905
has recently entered
this scenario?

523
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:50,069
Rugal's father?

524
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:53,911
You're saying Kotran Pa'Dar
was involved in the decision

525
00:28:53,948 --> 00:28:55,279
to evacuate Bajor?

526
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,544
Very good, Doctor!

527
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,814
l'm glad to see
our little get-togethers

528
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:00,514
haven't gone for naught.

529
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:05,219
Which makes him a political
enemy of Gul Dukat's

530
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:08,353
who lost his job as Prefect
when they withdrew.

531
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:10,330
And seemingly out of nowhere

532
00:29:10,364 --> 00:29:12,662
Dukat takes an interest
in this orphan boy

533
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,032
who recently arrives
on our station

534
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:18,163
and then soon afterwards,
with Gul Dukat's assistance

535
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:24,668
we discover that the orphan boy
isn't really an orphan boy

536
00:29:24,712 --> 00:29:26,907
but Pa'Dar's long-lost son.

537
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:28,677
Another coincidence?

538
00:29:28,716 --> 00:29:32,208
l believe in coincidences.

539
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:35,780
Coincidences happen every day.

540
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:39,088
But l don't trust coincidences.

541
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,160
l am Kotran Pa'Dar.

542
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:46,632
Miles O'Brien.
Come in.

543
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:52,966
Sit down.

544
00:29:58,346 --> 00:29:59,745
Where is my son?

545
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,940
Oh, he's with my wife.

546
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:02,313
They'll be back shortly.

547
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:08,552
l thought it might be
a good idea if we talked first.

548
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:12,319
Your son, Rugal...

549
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,124
At least they didn't
change his name.

550
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,326
When was the last time
you saw him?

551
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:23,963
On Bajor-- he had just
had his fourth birthday.

552
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,838
He probably doesn't
even remember me.

553
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:29,206
Does he?

554
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:33,043
l think he spent most of his
life trying to forget you.

555
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:36,012
l don't think l understand.

556
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:38,142
The boy hates everything he is.

557
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:41,018
He hates Cardassians,
he hates being a Cardassian.

558
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:43,386
Yes, l've heard those stories.

559
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,520
Well, l suppose after growing up
among the Bajorans...

560
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:50,223
but now that l'm back
in his life...

561
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:53,700
Well, he... may not want you
back in his life.

562
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:55,634
l am his father.

563
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:03,201
Mr. O'Brien, l know
very little about human culture.

564
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:05,735
l don't know
how you view the family.

565
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,147
We'd do almost anything
to protect our families.

566
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:10,980
l have a daughter myself.

567
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:14,977
She's four-- the same age
your son was when you lost him.

568
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:18,321
Then l expect you can imagine
what l'm feeling right now.

569
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:22,625
On Cardassia,
family is everything.

570
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:26,724
We care for our parents and
children with equal devotion.

571
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,632
ln some households

572
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:31,433
four generations
eat at the same table.

573
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:35,203
Family... is everything.

574
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:38,700
And l have failed in
my responsibility to my family.

575
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:41,715
You had no way of knowing
he was still alive.

576
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:44,809
l should have tried harder!

577
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:48,015
l should have looked everywhere!

578
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:54,686
To abandon my son, to allow him
to be raised by a Bajoran...

579
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:59,689
l have disgraced everything
that a Cardassian believes in.

580
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,648
Hello, Rugal.

581
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:34,155
Do you remember my face?

582
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,498
Even a little?

583
00:32:40,471 --> 00:32:41,768
No.

584
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:47,507
Would you like to see
some pictures of you

585
00:32:47,544 --> 00:32:48,806
when you were a child?

586
00:32:48,846 --> 00:32:49,813
No.

587
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:50,836
Hey.

588
00:33:06,797 --> 00:33:08,025
Rugal...

589
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:10,431
you have to understand.

590
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:16,702
There was nothing left of the
house after the attack.

591
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,834
Your mother was dead

592
00:33:19,877 --> 00:33:21,344
and you...

593
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:26,681
l... cried for you, Rugal.

594
00:33:26,717 --> 00:33:29,481
l missed you so much.

595
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,489
l could not even stay on Bajor.

596
00:33:32,523 --> 00:33:36,926
lt was too close
to the happy memories of you.

597
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,860
lt was your own fault.

598
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:40,796
You deserved it.

599
00:33:40,831 --> 00:33:42,628
You are a Cardassian.

600
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:45,897
What the Bajorans did,
they had to do.

601
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:47,836
l understand why you say that.

602
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:49,498
You can't understand!

603
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,737
You are a Cardassian
butcher, a butcher!

604
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:54,971
They killed your son
for your crimes.

605
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:55,977
Rugal...

606
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,072
You are not my father.

607
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:01,914
And l will never go
back to Cardassia.

608
00:34:01,985 --> 00:34:03,475
Never.

609
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:17,290
l have no intention of allowing

610
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:19,928
a Bajoran court to rule
on the custody of my son.

611
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,462
You gave up custody
when you abandoned him here.

612
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:25,441
He is my natural-born child.

613
00:34:25,476 --> 00:34:27,376
As Cardassian law clearly...

614
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:29,936
There is no more
Cardassian law on Bajor.

615
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:31,310
Gentlemen.

616
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:34,511
l think you may be in need
of an arbitrator to settle this.

617
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:37,111
Well, it must be someone

618
00:34:37,154 --> 00:34:40,954
who is neither a Cardassian
nor a Bajoran.

619
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,321
What about you?

620
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:45,152
l'd be willing.

621
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:47,288
But wouldn't you have objections

622
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:49,891
because of the Federation's
relationship with Bajor?

623
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:54,335
No, Commander.
You are a father, too.

624
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:56,305
You would be acceptable to me.

625
00:34:57,741 --> 00:35:00,073
Very well then.
l'll schedule a...

626
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,907
Odo to Commander Sisko.

627
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:03,536
Yes, Odo, what is it?

628
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,208
l thought you might be
interested to know.

629
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,980
Gul Dukat has just arrived
on the station.

630
00:35:18,629 --> 00:35:22,895
Station Log, Stardate 47 177.2.

631
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:25,800
The arrival of Gul Dukat
only powers my suspicion

632
00:35:25,836 --> 00:35:29,567
that we are being manipulated
in some unseen manner.

633
00:35:29,606 --> 00:35:32,074
Dr. Bashir and Garak
continue to search

634
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:35,237
for anything of relevance
in the adoption files.

635
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:37,804
So far they've found nothing.

636
00:35:37,848 --> 00:35:40,146
And the decision
on custody for Rugal

637
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:42,652
cannot wait much longer.

638
00:35:43,787 --> 00:35:47,120
You've come a long way
just to view a custody hearing.

639
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:51,355
Pa'Dar is an eminent member
of the Civilian Assembly.

640
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:54,558
This matter has generated
a great deal of interest

641
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:57,123
at the highest levels
of our government.

642
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,135
So you're here representing
your government.

643
00:35:59,169 --> 00:36:00,864
Not exactly.

644
00:36:00,904 --> 00:36:03,998
l like to think l'm here
representing the children--

645
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:07,010
all of the children who
were abandoned on Bajor.

646
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:10,946
l want to see Rugal
reunited with his father.

647
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:17,453
Well, l'm sure Pa'Dar is
grateful for your support.

648
00:36:19,122 --> 00:36:21,056
Because l was
under the impression

649
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,150
that you were
political adversaries.

650
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:24,820
lsn't that so, Pa'Dar?

651
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:28,795
We have disagreed in the past.

652
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:31,198
But, Commander, l don't see...

653
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:32,930
l must object, Commander.

654
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:36,269
The past is the past--
it has no relevance here.

655
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:38,934
What is relevant
are the children.

656
00:36:38,976 --> 00:36:42,343
What are we going to do
about the children?

657
00:36:42,379 --> 00:36:46,110
lf you don't mind, l'd like
for you to go over the events

658
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:51,109
leading up to the disappearance
of Rugal eight years ago.

659
00:36:51,154 --> 00:36:53,748
How perfectly foolish of me.

660
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,953
Don't tell me you've decided
you were wrong.

661
00:36:57,027 --> 00:37:01,293
Not after searching 7,420 files
for a misspelling.

662
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:04,061
Dukat is much smarter than that.

663
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:05,625
Than what?

664
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:07,899
Think about it, Doctor.

665
00:37:08,005 --> 00:37:11,168
He would never have left
a file to be found.

666
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:13,267
Do you really think he
purged the file on Rugal?

667
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,902
l would have.

668
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:19,609
There was something in that file
he didn't want anybody to see.

669
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,242
Exactly.

670
00:37:21,285 --> 00:37:24,618
We have one last chance--
to find the person

671
00:37:24,655 --> 00:37:26,555
who wrote that file
in the first place.

672
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,182
How do you ever hope
to find him?

673
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:30,125
Her.

674
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,923
Her?
How do you know?

675
00:37:31,995 --> 00:37:34,589
Because l've already
found her name-- Jomat Luson.

676
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:42,935
Do you remember anything
from back then, Rugal?

677
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,031
No.

678
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:47,805
Do you remember being adopted?

679
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:49,641
No.

680
00:37:52,316 --> 00:37:55,547
What's the first thing
you do remember?

681
00:37:57,754 --> 00:38:00,621
My father teaching me
how to swim.

682
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,157
l know exactly the one
you're talking about.

683
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:08,528
You do?

684
00:38:08,565 --> 00:38:11,864
He was the only Cardassian boy
we had at the time.

685
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:13,233
We had several girls.

686
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,238
Are you sure his name was Rugal?

687
00:38:15,272 --> 00:38:16,864
That's what we were told.

688
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:18,568
Somebody told you his name?

689
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:20,872
Yes, that was
the most unusual thing

690
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:22,708
about his arrival.

691
00:38:22,746 --> 00:38:26,045
Virtually all of the other
Cardassian children

692
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:29,917
turned in to us were found
on the streets by Bajorans.

693
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,648
Rugal was brought in
by a Cardassian.

694
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:35,556
A Cardassian military
officer, by any chance?

695
00:38:35,592 --> 00:38:37,423
Yes, as a matter of fact,
she was.

696
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:38,723
A woman.

697
00:38:38,762 --> 00:38:43,790
l don't remember her name,
but she was attached

698
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:46,598
to the command post
at Terok Nor.

699
00:38:46,636 --> 00:38:49,298
ls there anything else, Doctor?

700
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:56,375
The boy accused him
of being a butcher.

701
00:38:56,413 --> 00:38:58,904
He hates Cardassians, sir.

702
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,576
Pa'Dar was heartbroken.

703
00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:03,586
l can only imagine
how l'd feel in his shoes.

704
00:39:07,124 --> 00:39:08,421
Commander...

705
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:11,188
can l ask a few questions?

706
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:23,351
Chief, didn't Pa'Dar tell you

707
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:26,618
about the humiliation
he feels right now?

708
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:28,488
He said he had disgraced

709
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:31,017
everything a Cardassian
believes in.

710
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:33,087
Has news of your son's discovery

711
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,530
become public knowledge
on Cardassia?

712
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:39,400
The government has not chosen
to reveal it to the people yet.

713
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:41,530
What happens
when it is revealed?

714
00:39:41,572 --> 00:39:44,871
lt will be the end
of my political career.

715
00:39:44,942 --> 00:39:46,705
That's a shame...

716
00:39:46,744 --> 00:39:49,144
especially
considering the timing.

717
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,477
The timing?

718
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:52,880
lsn't there an inquiry
about to begin

719
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:55,181
concerning the Cardassians
who were involved

720
00:39:55,219 --> 00:39:57,813
in the attempted
military coup on Bajor?

721
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,880
Yes.

722
00:39:59,957 --> 00:40:03,552
And isn't Gul Dukat one of
the key witness in that inquiry?

723
00:40:03,594 --> 00:40:05,687
This is irrelevant
and insulting.

724
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,028
Commander,
you've lost control here.

725
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:10,829
Yes, it seems that l have.

726
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:14,031
l suggest we return to the issue
of the children.

727
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:15,368
All right.

728
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:18,134
Let's talk about children.

729
00:40:18,175 --> 00:40:19,142
Have you ever been

730
00:40:19,176 --> 00:40:20,905
to the Tozhat Resettlement
Center on Bajor

731
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:22,037
where Rugal was adopted?

732
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,137
Never.

733
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,204
Of course.

734
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:26,341
Tozhat is the province
where Pa'Dar

735
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:28,318
was stationed eight years ago.

736
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:29,876
l'm aware of that.

737
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:36,924
l've been trying to find records
of Rugal's adoption

738
00:40:36,994 --> 00:40:39,258
but they're missing
from the files.

739
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:41,888
How unfortunate.

740
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:45,299
Yes, but we have found someone
who was working at the Center

741
00:40:45,336 --> 00:40:47,395
at the time Rugal
was brought in.

742
00:40:47,438 --> 00:40:50,100
Do you know of a Bajoran
social volunteer

743
00:40:50,141 --> 00:40:51,802
named Jomat Luson?

744
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:53,173
No.

745
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:56,407
Well, Jomat Luson remembers
Rugal being brought in

746
00:40:56,447 --> 00:40:58,540
by a Cardassian military officer

747
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:02,382
a woman who seemed familiar
with him-- even knew his name.

748
00:41:04,288 --> 00:41:05,983
ls there a question?

749
00:41:06,023 --> 00:41:08,856
The question is whether
or not this officer

750
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:11,589
deliberately left the son
of Kotran Pa'Dar

751
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:13,529
at the relocation center

752
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:16,192
with the full knowledge
that he was not an orphan.

753
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:20,636
Perhaps even with the hopes
of humiliating Pa'Dar someday.

754
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:24,138
l wouldn't know.

755
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:27,440
Well, would you happen
to know, then, of a base

756
00:41:27,478 --> 00:41:30,345
known during the occupation
as Terok Nor?

757
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:32,713
Terok Nor?

758
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,480
lt was here, this space station.

759
00:41:37,188 --> 00:41:39,179
Jomat Luson clearly recalls

760
00:41:39,223 --> 00:41:41,919
that the officer
who brought in Rugal

761
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:44,223
was attached to Terok Nor.

762
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:54,164
Gul Dukat!

763
00:41:54,205 --> 00:41:57,766
Who was the commanding officer
of Terok Nor eight years ago?

764
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:08,079
For the record

765
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:11,418
the commanding officer
of Terok Nor eight years ago

766
00:42:11,455 --> 00:42:13,013
was Gul Dukat.

767
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:21,892
Station Log, Stardate 47 178.3.

768
00:42:21,966 --> 00:42:24,161
After long and difficult
deliberations

769
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:25,759
l have decided to allow Pa'Dar

770
00:42:25,803 --> 00:42:27,634
to take his son
back to Cardassia.

771
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:30,469
Although l am convinced
his Bajoran foster parents

772
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:31,736
treated him with love

773
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:34,802
Rugal has been the clear victim
in this conspiracy.

774
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:38,474
l believe it's time
for his healing to begin.

775
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:43,075
Your doctor has given me
the leverage l need, Commander.

776
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,348
Leverage?

777
00:42:44,388 --> 00:42:46,322
Dukat will never
allow these events

778
00:42:46,357 --> 00:42:47,551
to be made public now

779
00:42:47,591 --> 00:42:49,923
and l certainly won't
choose to discuss them.

780
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,224
-A stalemate.
-A stalemate.

781
00:42:52,263 --> 00:42:54,823
You've helped me salvage
my political career.

782
00:42:54,865 --> 00:42:56,025
l won't forget that.

783
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:57,863
Perhaps you will
use your influence

784
00:42:57,902 --> 00:43:00,097
to help other Cardassian
orphans on Bajor.

785
00:43:00,137 --> 00:43:03,334
Well, yes, we'll see.

786
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:04,568
Remember what l said.

787
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:07,736
lf you ever want to come
back and visit them

788
00:43:07,778 --> 00:43:10,542
just let me know
and l'll arrange it.

789
00:43:11,615 --> 00:43:14,277
Hello, Rugal.
Ready to go?

790
00:43:21,425 --> 00:43:23,518
l suppose it'll take time.

791
00:43:39,643 --> 00:43:43,909
But there's one more question
l haven't figured out, Garak.

792
00:43:43,948 --> 00:43:46,382
Why did you want
to expose Dukat?

793
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:48,908
What's the truth
about you and him?

794
00:43:48,986 --> 00:43:52,149
Truth, Doctor, is in
the eye of the beholder.

795
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:54,054
l never tell the truth

796
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:57,356
because l don't believe
there is such a thing.

797
00:43:57,394 --> 00:44:00,420
That's why l prefer
the straight-line simplicity

798
00:44:00,464 --> 00:44:02,091
of cutting cloth.

799
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:04,100
So you're not going to tell me.

800
00:44:04,134 --> 00:44:07,035
But you don't need me
to tell you, my friend.

801
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:09,130
Just notice the details.

802
00:44:09,173 --> 00:44:11,232
They're scattered like crumbs

803
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:14,176
all over this table
we regularly share.

804
00:44:15,346 --> 00:44:16,973
Until next time.
