1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,661
All right, Morn.

2
00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:07,687
You know the rules.

3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:09,325
No sleeping on the Promenade.

4
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:10,357
Go home.

5
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:37,225
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

6
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,688
The risk is to you, Lieutenant.

7
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:09,660
l could probably think better
without your hand on my thigh.

8
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,357
Now, how did that get there?

9
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,660
So, uh, what's it going to be?

10
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,330
Confront, evade,
acquire, retreat...

11
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,366
Confront.

12
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,171
Yes!

13
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,179
Doesn't she ever lose?

14
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,180
Tell me, Lieutenant

15
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,182
how'd you get to be
so good at <i>tongo?</i>

16
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:33,911
Actually, it was Curzon
who played it all the time.

17
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,351
Well, that explains it.

18
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,185
lt's Curzon who's beating
us-- not this female.

19
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,485
This female happens
to be a better player

20
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:41,651
than Curzon ever was.

21
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:43,024
And a prettier one, too.

22
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,861
Maybe so, but l still
prefer a Ferengi female--

23
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,025
one who never wears clothes

24
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,364
never talks back

25
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,199
and never plays <i>tongo!</i>

26
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,899
ls that really how you
prefer your women--

27
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,305
naked and submissive?

28
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:58,775
You find such a lifestyle
appealing?

29
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,801
Ah, don't you wish?

30
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:04,247
l do, l really do.

31
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:05,408
All right.

32
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,577
The opening risk is
at five strips of latinum.

33
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:08,779
The purchase is at three

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,809
the sell is at eight.

35
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:11,811
Absolutely not.

36
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:13,882
This isn't the proper time!

37
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,120
l'm trying to concentrate.

38
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:17,458
l'm sorry, Brother.

39
00:02:17,496 --> 00:02:19,157
lt's this insolent
young waiter's fault.

40
00:02:19,197 --> 00:02:20,164
My apologies, Quark

41
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:22,166
but l really think
you should try this.

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,599
What is it?

43
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,159
A way to double
your beverage profits.

44
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:26,227
Taste it.

45
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:33,836
You see, just as l told you.

46
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,312
He immediately
reached for his drink.

47
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:36,575
So l did.

48
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:43,721
Amazing.

49
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:46,417
You don't even
realize you're thirsty.

50
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,447
What are they?

51
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:49,187
Gramilian sand peas.

52
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,455
They inhibit the secretion
of the salivary glands

53
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,794
while drying out
the tissues of the tongue.

54
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:55,299
lt works every time.

55
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:57,859
lf you replace

56
00:02:57,903 --> 00:03:00,201
your complimentary
dishes of <i>lokar</i> beans

57
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:02,536
with Gramilian sand peas,
you won't be able

58
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:05,065
to fill your customers'
glasses fast enough.

59
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,372
What's your name again?

60
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:07,469
Pel.

61
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:10,379
So, what do you think
about my idea?

62
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:12,883
l think l agree with
the 59th Rule of Acquisition.

63
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:15,011
Free advice is seldom cheap.

64
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:17,749
True, but the 22nd Rule says

65
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:20,519
a wise man can hear
profit in the wind.

66
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,856
l see you know your Rules.

67
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:24,760
All 285 of them

68
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:27,629
and the various commentaries
on them, as well.

69
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,328
l don't plan on being
a waiter forever.

70
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:32,495
Good, then you're fired.

71
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:33,504
Shut up, Rom.

72
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:35,005
When it comes to business

73
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,032
my brother has the weak
little lobes of a female.

74
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:41,273
So, uh, what made you take
a job here at the station?

75
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:44,510
l wanted to learn
from the very best.

76
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,007
Uh-huh, which brings to mind
the 33rd Rule of Acquisition.

77
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:50,681
lt never hurts
to suck up to the boss.

78
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:56,419
What's that?

79
00:03:56,461 --> 00:04:00,022
The Grand Nagus Zek's
personal subspace frequency.

80
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:02,124
l wonder what he wants.

81
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,666
Why do you look so surprised?

82
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,137
l told you l'd be back.

83
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,298
Uh, l've looked forward
to your return, Nagus.

84
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:13,334
Still the perfect
little toady, eh, Quark?

85
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,345
l try to be.

86
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,778
Then listen carefully.

87
00:04:15,814 --> 00:04:18,578
The Ferengi expansion
into the Gamma Quadrant

88
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:19,709
is about to begin.

89
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:22,185
l'd like you to be
my chief negotiator.

90
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:24,382
Me?

91
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:25,946
That's right.

92
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,152
l'm offering you an opportunity

93
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,457
to make more profit
than you ever dreamed of.

94
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:33,657
All you have to do is earn it.

95
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:39,091
Can l interest you
in some Hupyrian beetle snuff?

96
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:40,095
l don't think so.

97
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:40,892
Major?

98
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:41,899
No, thank you.

99
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,094
Well, suit yourself.

100
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:45,727
More for me.

101
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:58,712
Little late, aren't we?

102
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:06,052
So you wanted
to see me, Commander?

103
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:07,784
l understand you're
planning to host

104
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,794
a business conference
here at the station.

105
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:13,264
Yes, with the Dosi,
a race from the Gamma Quadrant.

106
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:15,425
A very profitable
opportunity for all concerned

107
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:16,491
l might add.

108
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:18,593
Profitable for the Ferengi,
maybe.

109
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:20,866
Are you implying something,
Major?

110
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:22,304
Me?
Not at all, no.

111
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,366
The Ferengi reputation
speaks for itself.

112
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,710
A reputation for honesty
and decency and reliability.

113
00:07:29,747 --> 00:07:32,272
You always know what to expect

114
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,285
when you do business
with the Ferengi.

115
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,446
Which is why, if you're smart

116
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:38,080
you don't do business
with the Ferengi.

117
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:40,180
l think you've made
your point, Major.

118
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:43,058
As misinformed and misguided
as it may be.

119
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:46,894
Besides, how we do business
is no concern of yours.

120
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:49,229
Except when you conduct
your business on this station.

121
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:52,327
ln other words, Zek,
Grand Nagus or no Grand Nagus

122
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,930
if we allow you to hold
your negotiations here

123
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,441
and we find out
you're cheating the Dosi

124
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:01,241
l'll see to it you never
set foot on this station again.

125
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,407
Did anyone ever tell you
your eyes shine

126
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:08,215
with the brilliance
of Kibberian fire diamonds?

127
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:09,686
Not that l recall.

128
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:11,484
Well, they do.

129
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:15,857
So, tell me, Major,
could Bajor use

130
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:19,921
50,000 kilos of brizeen nitrate?

131
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:23,097
Of course, we could.

132
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:25,967
With that much brizeen,
we could fertilize

133
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,869
the entire northern peninsula.

134
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:30,500
Well, l've recently
come into possession

135
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,737
of 50,000 kilos
of brizeen nitrate

136
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:37,874
and to show you how much
your cooperation means to me

137
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,613
l'll let you have
the entire shipment.

138
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:45,282
l'll still need your assurances

139
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:47,257
that the Dosi will
be fairly treated

140
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,281
while they're here.

141
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:50,055
You have my word.

142
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:51,254
Good.

143
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:52,285
Then, it's settled.

144
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:55,892
Now, let's see--

145
00:08:55,934 --> 00:09:00,928
50,000 kilos at, uh,
25% of our usual price.

146
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:03,805
25% ? You just said
you were giving it to them.

147
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,809
Well, you're right, Commander.

148
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:07,435
We're all friends here.

149
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:10,538
So, l'll let you
have it at cost.

150
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,914
l have a better idea.

151
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:14,475
Why not consider the nitrate

152
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,384
as a gift
to the people of Bajor?

153
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:18,048
A gift?

154
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,556
That doesn't sound
very profitable.

155
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:21,957
lt depends.

156
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:23,153
On what?

157
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:26,925
On whether you want
to conduct business here or not.

158
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,702
Your negotiating skills
aren't bad for a hu-man.

159
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:38,903
Your nitrate will be
delivered promptly.

160
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:43,937
Anything else you need,
come see me personally.

161
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:52,355
Well, Quark, l've been involved

162
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,416
in some very profitable
opportunities in my time

163
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,325
but my lobes are telling me

164
00:09:57,362 --> 00:10:01,799
that this may be
the most profitable opportunity

165
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,301
in Ferengi history.

166
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:05,302
lmagine that.

167
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:07,327
And part of those profits
will be mine.

168
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:09,340
Profit, fame, power--

169
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:11,103
as much as you want.

170
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:14,975
Tell me, uh, Nagus, what exactly
is this great opportunity?

171
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:18,107
l can sum it up in one word--
tulaberries.

172
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:19,479
Tulaberries?

173
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:20,711
Exactly.

174
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:21,946
Go on.

175
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:24,648
Well, they're the main
ingredient in tulaberry wine.

176
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:29,820
Your job will be to purchase
10,000 vats from the Dosi.

177
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:31,556
We're going
into the wine business?

178
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:34,121
Within a single year,
we'll have made tulaberry wine

179
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:37,565
the most popular drink
in their entire sector.

180
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:38,660
That's enough!

181
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:44,565
Oh, l like it--
very distinguished.

182
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:48,705
Tell me, Nagus--
how are tulaberries going to be

183
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:51,340
the most profitable opportunity
in Ferengi history?

184
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,543
Do l have to spell it out
for you?

185
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:55,381
lf you don't mind.

186
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,409
Tulaberries

187
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:58,854
will establish
a Ferengi presence

188
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,881
inside the Gamma Quadrant.

189
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:04,986
And once we get our foot
in the door

190
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:07,793
they'll never get it out.

191
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:10,494
Yes, l see!

192
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:16,098
Tulaberries, Quark, tulaberries.

193
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:17,936
Tulaberries.

194
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,101
l wonder what they taste like.

195
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:20,633
Who cares what they taste like?

196
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:22,839
They're an opportunity
to get a Ferengi foot

197
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,108
in the Gamma Quadrant door.

198
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:26,206
And it'll be your foot, Brother.

199
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,217
l'm so proud.

200
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:29,515
l'm going to make history, Rom

201
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,385
and l'm going to be rich.

202
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:34,687
And l have the Grand Nagus
to thank for it.

203
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:36,421
He must really like me.

204
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:38,224
Just remember one thing--

205
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:41,527
the bigger the smile,
the sharper the knife.

206
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,864
48th Rule of Acquisition.

207
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:44,868
He has some nerve.

208
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:46,563
l warned you about that fellow.

209
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:49,664
Pel, do you mind telling me
what you meant just now?

210
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,504
Did you ever think
about why the Nagus

211
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:54,136
has put you in charge
of such a lucrative opportunity?

212
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:55,145
lsn't it obvious?

213
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:56,976
He knows l have
the lobes for business.

214
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:58,481
That's only part of it.

215
00:11:58,516 --> 00:11:59,483
l refuse to stand here

216
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:00,916
and allow my brother
to be insulted.

217
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:01,919
You're fired.

218
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:03,079
Shut up!

219
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:04,088
Go on.

220
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:06,056
lf the negotiations
are profitable

221
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,752
then the Nagus becomes
the greatest hero ever

222
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:09,760
but if they fail

223
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:11,921
he's going to need
someone to take the blame.

224
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:13,260
You mean me?

225
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:16,789
All l'm saying is, be careful.

226
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:19,530
l never heard
such ridiculous lies.

227
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,061
He's just jealous
of your success, Brother.

228
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:23,073
No, he's right.

229
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:25,302
lf something goes wrong,
it'll be my fault.

230
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:27,470
Then you're going
to need help, Brother.

231
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:28,570
Yes!

232
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:30,103
Someone to serve
as your consultant

233
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:31,115
during negotiations.

234
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:32,114
Yes!

235
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:33,115
Someone like me.

236
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,116
No.

237
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:37,086
Uh, l've been thinking
about what you just said

238
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,521
and, uh, l probably
could use some help

239
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,115
during these negotiations.

240
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,126
l accept.

241
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,127
Good.

242
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:44,253
Then we're partners.

243
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:46,729
Not quite--
l don't need a partner.

244
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:48,322
l need an assistant.

245
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:50,596
All right, but l get 25%
of everything you make.

246
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:51,602
Fifteen.

247
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:52,603
Twenty.

248
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:53,695
Done.

249
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,831
But, Brother,
what can l do to help?

250
00:12:55,873 --> 00:12:57,465
You want to help?

251
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:59,499
Table six is waiting.

252
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:17,601
How do l look?

253
00:14:17,638 --> 00:14:19,037
Nervous.

254
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,062
Who, me?

255
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:22,074
What have l got
to be nervous about?

256
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:23,735
Yeah, it's Zek
who should be nervous--

257
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:25,871
with Quark here
as his chief negotiator.

258
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:29,216
lf you ever do that again...

259
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,217
Do what?

260
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:31,775
lf you ever do that again

261
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:34,049
l'll stick those 50,000 kilos
of brizeen right up your...

262
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:35,487
Here they come!

263
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:43,187
Don't worry,
just a minor disagreement.

264
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:58,904
So, uh, can l get anyone
something to eat?

265
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:01,440
All right.

266
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:03,916
Um, in that case,
let's go over our offer.

267
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:06,613
As you know, the Ferengi
are interested in purchasing

268
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:08,713
10,000 vats
of tulaberry wine.

269
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:11,054
ln exchange,
the Dosi will receive

270
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:14,152
what l consider to be
a very fair trade package.

271
00:15:14,195 --> 00:15:16,527
There are some very interesting
items on that list--

272
00:15:16,564 --> 00:15:17,758
a subspace field modulator

273
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,357
uh, some optical
data processors...

274
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,994
We'll give you 5,000 vats.

275
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:24,061
l'm afraid that won't be enough.

276
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:27,074
Um, we're looking to establish
a vast distribution network

277
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:28,642
in the Gamma Quadrant.

278
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:30,644
We'll need at least 10,000 vats.

279
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:32,908
l'm offering you 5,000 vats.

280
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:34,676
l suggest you take it.

281
00:15:34,715 --> 00:15:36,239
The Nagus will never agree.

282
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:38,514
This is a waste of time.

283
00:15:38,553 --> 00:15:40,487
We should be talking
directly to Zek.

284
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:41,886
l know we should
be talking to Zek.

285
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:46,053
Then why do you bother talking
to this insignificance?

286
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:47,287
Now, see what you've done?

287
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:48,625
What?

288
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:50,187
You've made me look foolish.

289
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:52,324
l didn't mean to.

290
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:53,560
Then bring us Zek.

291
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,863
The Nagus has asked

292
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:56,631
Quark to represent him
during these negotiations.

293
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,968
Are you implying

294
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:00,496
that Zek is too important
to negotiate with us?!

295
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,168
We never meant to imply
anything of the sort.

296
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,043
Because, if we kill you

297
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:09,048
Zek will have to talk to us.

298
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,142
You want to do business
with the Ferengi

299
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:13,619
you talk to Quark.

300
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:21,762
So how about it?

301
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:23,457
Do we say 10,000 vats?

302
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:29,662
We'll think about it.

303
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:39,512
Can l help you?

304
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:49,147
What is it?

305
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,220
lt's beautiful.

306
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:58,664
lt's latinum.

307
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:00,997
Excuse me,
l really can't accept this.

308
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:04,035
Did Zek really think

309
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:05,469
this was going
to get him anywhere?

310
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:06,666
Probably not.

311
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:09,642
But it doesn't stop
a Ferengi from trying.

312
00:17:09,677 --> 00:17:12,168
You sound like you
admire them for it.

313
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:15,182
l suppose, in a way, l do.

314
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:18,652
l don't understand your attitude
about the Ferengi.

315
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:20,313
That's because you don't

316
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:22,549
socialize with them
the way l do.

317
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,581
Looking back
over seven lifetimes

318
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,822
l can't think of a single
race l've enjoyed more.

319
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:31,730
Did anyone ever tell you
you have very strange taste?

320
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:34,894
l admit, they place
too much emphasis on profit

321
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:37,928
and their behavior towards
women is somewhat primitive...

322
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:41,499
They're greedy, misogynistic,
untrustworthy little trolls

323
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:44,340
and l wouldn't turn my back
on one of them for a second.

324
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:45,606
Neither would l.

325
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:47,079
But once you accept that

326
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:49,548
you'll find
they can be a lot of fun.

327
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:02,157
Evade.

328
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:05,589
Evade.

329
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:06,759
Retreat.

330
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:08,234
Acquire.

331
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:09,668
Confront.

332
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:14,202
Did l say ''acquire''?

333
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:15,674
l meant ''evade.''

334
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,041
You said ''acquire.''

335
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:18,543
Well, l meant ''evade''!

336
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:20,342
Why don't we just
play the round over?

337
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:21,643
That sounds fair.

338
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:22,876
Who asked you?

339
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:24,407
And shouldn't you
be plotting strategy

340
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:25,612
for tomorrow's negotiations?

341
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:26,620
Believe me, Nagus

342
00:18:26,654 --> 00:18:28,554
l've thought of nothing
else all evening.

343
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:30,386
That must be why
you're losing so badly.

344
00:18:30,424 --> 00:18:34,155
And l think, by tomorrow,
we should have an agreement.

345
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:36,163
Well, l've been thinking, too

346
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:39,428
and 10,000 vats
of tulaberry wine aren't enough.

347
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,559
Tell them we want 100,000.

348
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:41,966
100,000?

349
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:45,404
But l'm not sure they'll even
agree to sell us 10,000.

350
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:49,068
100,000 vats would mean
more profit for them and for us.

351
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,270
Now, do as l say!

352
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:53,007
Or l'm going to take over
the negotiations myself.

353
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:56,881
l think raising the stakes
is a brilliant idea.

354
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:57,975
You do?

355
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,385
lt'll show the Gamma Quadrant
we mean business.

356
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:02,787
No wonder Quark says
you're a genius.

357
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:04,882
Oh, he says that, does he?

358
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:06,859
All the time.

359
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:07,918
That's very touching.

360
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:09,361
Now bring me
some fresh tube grubs.

361
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:10,955
These are losing their crunch.

362
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:12,693
Right away.

363
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:19,465
So, l believe the next challenge
goes to you.

364
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:22,499
l think l'll pass on this round.

365
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:27,706
Such loyalty must be expensive.

366
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:30,740
You can't buy
that kind of loyalty.

367
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:33,720
You can where l come from.

368
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:37,187
ls the Nagus always
this impatient?

369
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:40,421
He wants results
and he expects me to get them.

370
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:43,021
But he's not making
my job any easier.

371
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:46,056
100,000 vats--
that's a lot of tulaberries.

372
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,600
You'll get them.

373
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:48,693
How can you be so sure?

374
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:50,067
Because you're good

375
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:53,470
and with me helping you,
you're even better.

376
00:19:53,507 --> 00:19:56,476
Why are you being so nice to me?

377
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,944
For 20% of your profits.

378
00:19:58,979 --> 00:19:59,968
Why else?

379
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,814
Fair enough.

380
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,011
Quark, where are my grubs?

381
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:06,417
Coming.

382
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:12,217
Mmm. Now this is
what l call fresh.

383
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:20,596
l didn't know the Replimat
had a Ferengi menu.

384
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:21,601
lt doesn't.

385
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:23,034
l like to try new things.

386
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,970
That's unusual for a Ferengi.

387
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:27,872
l never heard of a Trill
who could play <i>tongo.</i>

388
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:30,433
l guess that makes
us both unusual.

389
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:31,740
You know, l was impressed

390
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:34,043
by your show of loyalty
to Quark last night.

391
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:36,447
He deserves it.

392
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:37,849
That's not the point.

393
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:41,343
Any other Ferengi would've let
Zek pick him to pieces.

394
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:45,017
But you're not like
any other Ferengi l've ever met.

395
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,220
Quark really likes you.

396
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:50,355
He talks about you all the time.

397
00:20:50,397 --> 00:20:52,422
You know he once convinced me

398
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:54,798
to go up to a holosuite
with him?

399
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:56,132
Turns out, he recreated

400
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:58,296
the bedroom l slept in
as a child.

401
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:00,705
He overheard me
describing it to Kira.

402
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:02,766
Of course, most of the details
were wrong

403
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,437
but it was
a very sweet gesture--

404
00:21:04,478 --> 00:21:05,911
up until he tried to kiss me.

405
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:07,709
That sounds like Quark.

406
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:11,341
l don't care what anybody says.

407
00:21:11,385 --> 00:21:12,511
l love him.

408
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:13,781
So do l.

409
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:15,914
You really do, don't you?

410
00:21:15,956 --> 00:21:16,923
What?

411
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:17,924
Love Quark.

412
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,255
Don't bother trying to deny it.

413
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:20,783
l've seen the way
you look at him.

414
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:21,954
Please, keep your voice down.

415
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:23,190
Does he know?

416
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,255
He doesn't even know
l'm a female.

417
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:26,266
You're a woman?

418
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,359
Please lower your voice.

419
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:29,426
Please.

420
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,234
l knew there was something
different about you.

421
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:34,537
But l've never met
a Ferengi woman before.

422
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:36,634
You probably never will again.

423
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:39,111
On my world, women aren't
allowed leave the house

424
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:40,773
or wear clothes,
or learn to read.

425
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:41,872
And you wanted more.

426
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,110
Why not?

427
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:45,379
l'm as smart as any man.

428
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,115
So l made myself a pair
of synthetic lobes

429
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:49,121
and became one.

430
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:50,212
Why come here?

431
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:53,158
To acquire profit, of course.

432
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:56,963
There's only one thing
l wasn't counting on.

433
00:21:56,997 --> 00:21:59,022
Falling in love with Quark.

434
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:01,557
What do you think l should do?

435
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:03,570
l don't know.

436
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:06,505
But l do know there's
more to life than profit.

437
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,735
Pel, it's time!

438
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:10,744
We don't want to keep
the Dosi waiting.

439
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:11,972
Hurry!

440
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:14,947
Okay, now, l think our best...

441
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,962
Excuse me.

442
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:34,530
Ah, Major.

443
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:38,806
Did that shipment of brizeen
nitrate arrive on time?

444
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:39,903
Yes, it did.

445
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:40,913
Good.

446
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:42,141
And here you are to thank me.

447
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:45,310
Have a seat.

448
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,946
Actually, l just stopped by
to return this.

449
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:49,979
Why, is something
wrong with it?

450
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:51,991
No, it's lovely,
l just can't accept it.

451
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:52,992
Then l suppose

452
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:56,223
a night of wild,
passionate romance

453
00:22:56,263 --> 00:22:58,424
is out of the question?

454
00:22:58,465 --> 00:23:00,433
That's right.

455
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,162
Just thought l'd ask.

456
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,103
Dax must be crazy.

457
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:10,676
Nice view, isn't it?

458
00:23:10,711 --> 00:23:13,179
Don't tell me the negotiations
are already over.

459
00:23:13,213 --> 00:23:14,407
That's fast work, Quark.

460
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:16,006
Now, let's see the contract.

461
00:23:17,317 --> 00:23:19,308
There is no contract.

462
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:20,876
No contract?

463
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:23,253
But you offered to buy
100,000 vats, didn't you?

464
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,257
Yes.

465
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,258
And?

466
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,816
And that's when they left.

467
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,827
The room?

468
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:28,850
-The station.
-What?

469
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:31,159
l begged them to stay.

470
00:23:31,198 --> 00:23:33,826
This is a catastrophe,
a complete catastrophe.

471
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:36,734
This was your big chance, Quark,
and you blew it!

472
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,738
You may have seriously harmed

473
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:42,208
future Ferengi opportunities
in the Gamma Quadrant!

474
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:43,368
Hold on a minute.

475
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,173
We said we're going
to get you the tulaberries

476
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:46,873
and that's exactly
what we're going to do.

477
00:23:46,913 --> 00:23:47,880
We are?

478
00:23:47,914 --> 00:23:48,881
How?

479
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:50,348
We're going to travel

480
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:51,816
to the Gamma Quadrant,
find the Dosi

481
00:23:51,852 --> 00:23:53,251
and get them
to sign the contract.

482
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:55,982
And how do you plan
to get there?

483
00:23:56,022 --> 00:23:57,614
We'll take your ship.

484
00:23:57,657 --> 00:23:58,749
My ship?

485
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:01,226
Oh, and l suppose
you expect Maihar'du

486
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:02,558
to pilot it for you.

487
00:24:02,596 --> 00:24:03,995
We don't need Maihar'du.

488
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,622
l can pilot the ship myself.

489
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:06,962
lt's up to you, Nagus.

490
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,195
Do you want
those tulaberries or not?

491
00:24:10,437 --> 00:24:11,734
All right.

492
00:24:11,772 --> 00:24:13,967
You can use my ship,
but l'm warning you, Quark--

493
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:16,999
either you get the Dosi
to sign that contract

494
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:21,308
or you'll be tending
that worthless little bar

495
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:23,009
for the rest of your life!

496
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:38,222
l've waited my whole life
for an opportunity like this.

497
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,026
So have l.

498
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:43,865
So far, it hasn't turned out
quite the way l planned.

499
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:45,895
lt's not over yet.

500
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:48,339
l still don't understand
why the Nagus

501
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,775
is suddenly insisting
on 100,000 vats.

502
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:53,245
Neither do l.

503
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,305
You don't think
he's purposely trying

504
00:24:55,348 --> 00:24:56,872
to sabotage the negotiation?

505
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:58,407
Why would he?

506
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:00,282
l have no idea.

507
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,584
Hmm. One thing's for certain--

508
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:05,318
he knows more
than he's letting on.

509
00:25:05,358 --> 00:25:06,484
About what?

510
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:09,154
Everything--
the tulaberries, the Dosi

511
00:25:09,196 --> 00:25:10,663
even the Gamma Quadrant.

512
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:11,891
Well, if you ever figure out

513
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:13,695
what he's up to,
make sure you tell me.

514
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:16,531
Don't worry, l will.

515
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,595
So far, the only thing
l've done right

516
00:25:18,638 --> 00:25:20,162
is pick you as my consultant.

517
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:23,870
l'm glad you feel that way.

518
00:25:26,546 --> 00:25:28,980
Now, if we can only
make some profit.

519
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,018
Quark, there's something
you should know.

520
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:34,020
Oh, you're too late.

521
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,419
l already know
what you're going to say.

522
00:25:35,455 --> 00:25:36,422
You do?

523
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:37,423
lt's no secret.

524
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:38,515
lt's not?

525
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:40,856
l admit you've been
a great help to me

526
00:25:40,894 --> 00:25:43,590
but you agreed to a 20%
share of the profits

527
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,757
and that's all
you're going to get.

528
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:48,029
l see.

529
00:25:48,134 --> 00:25:51,194
Never place friendship
above profit.

530
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:54,139
21st Rule of Acquisition.

531
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:56,301
l'm glad you agree.

532
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:57,571
Hmm.

533
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,387
Go, just go!

534
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:09,718
Go!

535
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:13,590
Oh...

536
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:17,286
Feeling a little
overwhelmed, are we?

537
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,991
l'm glad someone notices.

538
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,556
When's Quark due back?

539
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,124
Oh, how should l know?

540
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:23,999
He never tells me anything.

541
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:26,471
He doesn't even bother
to insult me anymore.

542
00:26:26,506 --> 00:26:27,598
Go, go.

543
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:30,269
lt's Pel, that,
that flabby-eared interloper.

544
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,574
He's stealing
my brother's affections.

545
00:26:32,612 --> 00:26:34,011
Hmm, you're better off.

546
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:35,376
But he's my brother!

547
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:38,009
Would you let someone
steal your brother?

548
00:26:38,051 --> 00:26:39,518
l don't have a brother.

549
00:26:39,552 --> 00:26:41,247
Not that l know of, anyway.

550
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:43,415
But if you did.

551
00:26:43,456 --> 00:26:47,119
Well, l suppose
if l did have a brother

552
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,958
even one as worthless
as Quark

553
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:53,557
l wouldn't let anyone
come between us.

554
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:38,104
There must be something here
l could use against him.

555
00:28:23,189 --> 00:28:24,656
l've got controlling interest

556
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:26,625
so l want to supervise
all operations.

557
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:27,785
That's ridiculous.

558
00:28:27,827 --> 00:28:29,260
Well, then find another partner.

559
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:30,785
Let's not be hasty.

560
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,923
l said, no!

561
00:28:34,534 --> 00:28:37,935
Are you enjoying yourselves,
little Ferengi?

562
00:28:37,971 --> 00:28:39,836
How could we not?

563
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:42,808
Tell us, Z yree--
what is this place?

564
00:28:42,842 --> 00:28:46,676
This-- this is where
opportunities are made.

565
00:28:46,713 --> 00:28:48,681
Really? l thought it
was some kind of party.

566
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:50,012
Then you thought wrong.

567
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,483
This is all about profit.

568
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:52,678
And like the Ferengi

569
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:55,711
the Dosi are very serious
when it comes to profit.

570
00:28:58,425 --> 00:29:00,586
You, take him away.

571
00:29:00,627 --> 00:29:03,027
Very serious.

572
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:11,478
Look who finally showed up.

573
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:17,106
lt's about time.

574
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,141
Where are you going?

575
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:21,085
To get serious about profit.

576
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:22,110
Hey, watch it!

577
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:29,519
Oh... it's you, Ferengi.

578
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:32,259
Aren't you on the wrong
side of the wormhole?

579
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:33,891
lt certainly feels that way.

580
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:36,368
Fortunately, all l need
is your thumbscan

581
00:29:36,403 --> 00:29:39,861
on this very lucrative contract
and l can go home.

582
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:41,874
You had your chance.

583
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:45,878
Go away!

584
00:29:45,912 --> 00:29:47,641
Not until we finish
our discussion.

585
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:54,317
You... are starting
to annoy me.

586
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:09,528
Sorry.

587
00:30:10,503 --> 00:30:13,165
l should have killed you
back on that station.

588
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:15,538
But you didn't because
deep down inside

589
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:17,873
you recognize a good opportunity
when you see one.

590
00:30:17,911 --> 00:30:20,846
Just put your thumbscan here.

591
00:30:22,515 --> 00:30:25,973
All right, you can
have the 10,000 vats.

592
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:26,986
100,000.

593
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,544
l told you before
that's impossible!

594
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:30,613
100,000 and l'm not leaving
till l get it.

595
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:32,090
Fine.

596
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,422
Then stay.

597
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:47,002
Wouldn't we be more comfortable
sleeping on the ship?

598
00:30:47,107 --> 00:30:49,007
No, l want to be right here
in case lnglatu

599
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:50,098
changes his mind.

600
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:51,804
Don't worry, l don't snore.

601
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:53,403
Wait!

602
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:54,470
What is it?

603
00:30:54,514 --> 00:30:55,879
The mattress.

604
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:56,847
What about it?

605
00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:58,578
lt looks lumpy.

606
00:30:58,618 --> 00:31:00,677
Actually, it's very comfortable.

607
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,620
l can't sleep
on a lumpy mattress.

608
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,250
Well, you're in luck, there's
not a lump to be found.

609
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:06,258
Try it for yourself.

610
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:07,384
What side do you want?

611
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:09,054
What are you doing?

612
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:10,858
Getting undressed.
What does it look like?

613
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:12,592
You're not going to sleep,
are you?

614
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:14,623
Why not? l'm tired.

615
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:17,796
Shouldn't we be discussing
rules of strategy?

616
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:19,304
There's nothing to discuss.

617
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:20,465
But you know

618
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:22,634
what the 103rd Rule
of Acquisition says.

619
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:23,973
Not offhand.

620
00:31:24,044 --> 00:31:25,568
Sleep can interfere...

621
00:31:25,612 --> 00:31:27,705
And l don't care, either!

622
00:31:28,815 --> 00:31:29,941
Wait!

623
00:31:29,983 --> 00:31:31,280
What is it now?

624
00:31:31,317 --> 00:31:32,944
First a toast.

625
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:33,782
To what?

626
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,913
To, uh, profit, of course.

627
00:31:35,955 --> 00:31:37,889
Of course.

628
00:31:44,731 --> 00:31:46,392
ls it warm in here?

629
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:47,957
lt must be the wine.

630
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:49,366
l hope so.

631
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:50,994
l was really impressed

632
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:53,505
with the way
you handled lnglatu.

633
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,531
l was good, wasn't l?

634
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:57,167
Now let's get to bed.

635
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,507
Wait!

636
00:31:58,545 --> 00:32:00,012
The look on his face

637
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,640
when you knocked
over that barrel.

638
00:32:02,682 --> 00:32:04,274
That was risky.

639
00:32:04,317 --> 00:32:07,218
The riskier the road,
the greater the profit.

640
00:32:07,253 --> 00:32:08,515
62nd Rule.

641
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:09,647
That's right.

642
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:12,419
You really know your Rules.

643
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:15,951
And you have a very nice smile.

644
00:32:16,062 --> 00:32:17,324
l do?

645
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:22,557
Oh, Quark, l have something
l have to tell you.

646
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,299
l'm not interrupting anything,
am l?

647
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:27,363
No, definitely not!

648
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:28,669
Are you sure?

649
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,970
Positive!

650
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:31,635
l'll come back tomorrow.

651
00:32:31,678 --> 00:32:33,646
Wait!

652
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,772
No, wait!

653
00:32:34,814 --> 00:32:36,179
This is all a silly
misunderstanding.

654
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:37,478
But you seem to be... busy.

655
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:38,814
Busy?

656
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:40,786
Don't be ridiculous.

657
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,118
We can't wait to hear
what you have to say.

658
00:32:43,156 --> 00:32:46,387
Besides, we could use
the company.

659
00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:47,450
Uh, isn't that right?

660
00:32:47,494 --> 00:32:48,552
Absolutely.

661
00:32:48,595 --> 00:32:49,823
All right, then.

662
00:32:49,863 --> 00:32:51,626
Let me give you some advice--

663
00:32:51,664 --> 00:32:53,996
lnglatu will never
sell you 100,000 vats

664
00:32:54,067 --> 00:32:57,002
of tulaberry wine, not
because he doesn't want to

665
00:32:57,036 --> 00:32:58,298
but because he can't.

666
00:32:58,338 --> 00:33:00,169
lf he can't, who can? You?

667
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:01,798
l wish l could, but there aren't

668
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:03,706
that many vats
on the entire planet.

669
00:33:03,743 --> 00:33:04,869
Then we're finished.

670
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:06,674
Not necessarily.

671
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:08,237
lf you really want

672
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:10,181
100,000 vats of tulaberry wine

673
00:33:10,216 --> 00:33:13,185
l can put you in touch
with the right people.

674
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:15,414
For a price, of course.

675
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:17,150
Of course.

676
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,887
l always said you were
my favorite Dosi.

677
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:23,953
Now, um, who do we have to see?

678
00:33:23,997 --> 00:33:26,591
The Karemma.

679
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:28,726
Who's the Karemma?

680
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:30,793
An important power
in the Dominion.

681
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:32,361
The Dominion, what's that?

682
00:33:32,405 --> 00:33:34,771
Let's just say,
if you want to do business

683
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:35,968
in the Gamma Quadrant

684
00:33:36,075 --> 00:33:38,805
you have to do business
with the Dominion.

685
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:54,858
''The most profitable opportunity
in Ferengi history''--

686
00:33:54,894 --> 00:33:56,486
that's what Zek called it

687
00:33:56,529 --> 00:33:58,497
but he didn't mean tulaberries,
no.

688
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:00,260
He meant the Dominion.

689
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,427
That's why he sabotaged
negotiations.

690
00:34:02,468 --> 00:34:04,163
He never wanted to do
business with the Dosi

691
00:34:04,204 --> 00:34:05,193
he just wanted to use them

692
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:06,535
to get
to a more important member

693
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:07,540
of the Dominion!

694
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:08,939
Quark, we need to talk.

695
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:09,940
We are talking.

696
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:12,671
Don't you want to know
why l kissed you?

697
00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:14,612
You never kissed me.

698
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:16,046
Yes, l did.

699
00:34:16,082 --> 00:34:17,049
No, you didn't

700
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,744
and l don't want
to discuss it anymore.

701
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:20,446
Let's just concentrate
on the Dominion.

702
00:34:20,486 --> 00:34:22,545
l only wish Z yree
would have told us more.

703
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:25,888
Maybe it's
some planetary alliance

704
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:28,155
or trading consortium.

705
00:34:28,194 --> 00:34:31,459
Whatever it is, it's important

706
00:34:31,497 --> 00:34:34,227
and l want a piece of it.

707
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:39,795
Quark, l'm very disappointed.

708
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,602
l really wanted
those tulaberries.

709
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:42,767
You and l both know my trip

710
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:44,367
had nothing to do
with tulaberries.

711
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,377
lt didn't?

712
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:46,639
l must speak with you, Brother.

713
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,941
Can't you see l'm busy?

714
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:52,281
Does the word ''Dominion''
mean anything to you?

715
00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:53,546
What have you found out?

716
00:34:53,586 --> 00:34:54,553
You first.

717
00:34:54,587 --> 00:34:55,554
Please, Brother, it's urgent.

718
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:56,555
Not now!

719
00:34:56,589 --> 00:34:57,556
l'm waiting.

720
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,115
Well, most of my information
consists

721
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,787
of little more
than hints and whispers

722
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:04,490
but it's enough to convince me

723
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,522
that whoever learns
the secret of the Dominion

724
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:10,035
whatever that may be,
will learn the secret

725
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:11,502
of the Gamma Quadrant.

726
00:35:11,537 --> 00:35:14,904
Unfortunately, the Dosi
don't seem to know very much.

727
00:35:14,941 --> 00:35:18,069
l was hoping they'd lead
us to someone who does.

728
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:20,477
What would such information
be worth to you?

729
00:35:20,513 --> 00:35:21,605
A lot.

730
00:35:21,648 --> 00:35:25,084
What if l told you
l could arrange a meeting

731
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:28,485
between you and a powerful
member of the Dominion?

732
00:35:28,521 --> 00:35:30,682
lf you can do that,
l'll see to it

733
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:34,352
that you earn a percentage
of every Ferengi opportunity

734
00:35:34,394 --> 00:35:36,828
in the Gamma Quadrant.

735
00:35:36,863 --> 00:35:38,922
Ah...

736
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:41,900
that's a lot of latinum.

737
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:44,927
Give me... a name.

738
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:50,102
-The Karemma.
-The Karemma.

739
00:35:50,143 --> 00:35:54,944
l always knew you had
the lobes for business.

740
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:59,117
Now may l speak with you,
Brother?

741
00:35:59,152 --> 00:36:01,313
All right, but make it quick.

742
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:38,914
Easy, now.

743
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:40,646
That's quite a bump
you've got there.

744
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:41,676
Where's Rom?

745
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:42,881
Right here, Brother.

746
00:36:42,923 --> 00:36:44,447
Luckily, there
doesn't seem to be

747
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:45,480
any serious damage.

748
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:46,924
Uh, if you don't mind

749
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:49,825
l'd like to rest here
for a few minutes.

750
00:36:49,863 --> 00:36:51,387
Of course.

751
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:53,058
l'll be in the other room
if you need me.

752
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,499
Thank you, Doctor.

753
00:36:56,803 --> 00:36:59,237
You haven't told anybody,
have you?

754
00:36:59,272 --> 00:37:00,830
You mean about Pel?

755
00:37:00,874 --> 00:37:01,841
Quiet.

756
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:03,570
l haven't breathed a word.

757
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,703
l thought it'd be best
if you told Zek yourself.

758
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,440
Nobody's going to tell Zek
anything, is that clear?

759
00:37:07,481 --> 00:37:09,244
But she's a female...

760
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:10,772
Not so loud.

761
00:37:10,817 --> 00:37:13,445
Who wears clothes and is
trying to earn profit.

762
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:14,749
Why, she even quotes

763
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:17,120
from the sacred Rules
of Acquisition.

764
00:37:17,157 --> 00:37:19,682
Such a female must be
severely punished.

765
00:37:19,726 --> 00:37:20,693
l know that.

766
00:37:20,727 --> 00:37:22,160
Then we'll stop her.

767
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:23,560
No.

768
00:37:23,597 --> 00:37:26,327
You're scaring me, Brother.

769
00:37:28,268 --> 00:37:30,532
Could it be you have
feelings for this woman?

770
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,037
Of course not.

771
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:33,630
Don't you see?

772
00:37:33,673 --> 00:37:37,302
lf Zek learns that l've
been deceived by a female

773
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:38,402
l'd be ruined.

774
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:39,912
He'd never trust me again.

775
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:42,208
But if you don't tell
him and he finds out

776
00:37:42,249 --> 00:37:43,716
you're certain to be ruined.

777
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,446
You have to tell him, or l will.

778
00:37:46,486 --> 00:37:48,386
Let me go.

779
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:50,218
l have to save you
from yourself.

780
00:37:50,257 --> 00:37:51,622
Forget about me.
What about the bar?

781
00:37:51,658 --> 00:37:53,182
The bar?

782
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:54,591
You still want it, don't you?

783
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:56,391
Don't you?

784
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:57,396
Who needs the bar

785
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,897
when l can have
the Gamma Quadrant?

786
00:37:58,932 --> 00:38:01,492
l'll transfer
ownership immediately

787
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:02,866
but only on one condition--

788
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:07,668
that you never mention the truth
about Pel to anyone.

789
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:09,197
Pel?

790
00:38:09,242 --> 00:38:11,403
W-W-What about him?

791
00:38:13,914 --> 00:38:15,438
Yeah.

792
00:38:16,783 --> 00:38:18,045
Come.

793
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:24,886
Where are your lobes?

794
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:27,587
Over there.

795
00:38:27,627 --> 00:38:29,822
Well, put them on
before somebody sees you.

796
00:38:30,964 --> 00:38:33,364
No one's going to see me.

797
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,891
Put them on.

798
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:37,402
Now.

799
00:38:37,437 --> 00:38:39,462
And wrap yourself up.

800
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:46,472
Have you finished packing?

801
00:38:46,513 --> 00:38:47,775
Am l going somewhere?

802
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:50,510
As far away from this station
as possible.

803
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,017
But you need me, Quark.

804
00:38:52,052 --> 00:38:54,077
l'm the only one you can trust.

805
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,951
Not anymore.

806
00:38:58,191 --> 00:39:00,989
Well, what did you expect?

807
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:03,154
l mean, look at you.

808
00:39:03,196 --> 00:39:05,721
You're wearing clothes.

809
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:06,754
ls that a crime?

810
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,495
As a matter of fact, it is.

811
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:11,868
Look, it's just too risky
for you to stay here.

812
00:39:11,905 --> 00:39:14,100
And you can take this with you.

813
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,198
What is it?

814
00:39:15,242 --> 00:39:16,641
Ten bars of latinum.

815
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:18,735
To help you start a new life.

816
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:23,177
lf you're going
to pretend you're a man

817
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:24,240
act like one.

818
00:39:24,284 --> 00:39:25,615
Take the profit.

819
00:39:25,652 --> 00:39:27,677
This is not about profit anymore

820
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:28,745
it's about love!

821
00:39:28,788 --> 00:39:31,780
Oh, spoken like a true female.

822
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:33,884
l love you, Quark

823
00:39:33,927 --> 00:39:35,690
and l know you care
about me, too.

824
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:36,696
Admit it!

825
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,721
What difference
does it make if l do?

826
00:39:38,765 --> 00:39:40,858
You'd never be happy
being a Ferengi wife.

827
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,664
Then come with me
to the Gamma Quadrant.

828
00:39:43,703 --> 00:39:46,001
No one there cares if
l wear clothes or not.

829
00:39:47,941 --> 00:39:49,875
l'd care.

830
00:39:54,114 --> 00:39:56,947
Then l guess
l'd better start packing.

831
00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:03,019
l guess so.

832
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:09,920
Mmm... mmm... mmm.

833
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:13,155
Mmm... mmm...

834
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:14,826
Mmm!

835
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:20,370
Mmm.

836
00:40:20,407 --> 00:40:24,776
These flaked blood fleas
are surprisingly succulent.

837
00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:27,609
Mm-hmm, you really should
try them, Brother-- mmm...

838
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:30,138
l'm not feeling
particularly hungry.

839
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:31,445
Let me guess.

840
00:40:31,484 --> 00:40:33,714
Too busy thinking
about how to spend

841
00:40:33,753 --> 00:40:36,051
all that latinum
we're going to earn?

842
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:37,613
Well, l don't blame you.

843
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:39,614
Come.

844
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:48,190
l thought you said
she left the station!

845
00:40:48,234 --> 00:40:49,667
l thought she did.

846
00:40:49,703 --> 00:40:51,170
l hope you don't mind, Quark

847
00:40:51,204 --> 00:40:54,264
but l couldn't leave without
saying good-bye to the Nagus.

848
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:55,774
l'm glad you stopped by.

849
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:57,777
l know how much
you helped Quark

850
00:40:57,811 --> 00:40:59,301
during the negotiations.

851
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:01,837
l predict a big future
for you, Pel.

852
00:41:01,881 --> 00:41:04,509
You certainly have
the lobes for it.

853
00:41:06,286 --> 00:41:08,379
So, you like my lobes?

854
00:41:08,421 --> 00:41:09,752
Pel...

855
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:11,484
Yes, l do.

856
00:41:11,524 --> 00:41:13,389
Good, then you can have them!

857
00:41:13,426 --> 00:41:14,484
No!

858
00:41:15,695 --> 00:41:16,855
lt's a female!

859
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:18,386
Does this mean
l don't get the bar?

860
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:19,921
Rom... out.

861
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:22,024
Quark, this is outrageous!

862
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:23,433
Now what's going on here?

863
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,437
l-l-l...

864
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:25,460
Leave him out of this!

865
00:41:25,505 --> 00:41:27,598
You dare give me orders?

866
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,198
You knew about this all along,
didn't you?

867
00:41:29,242 --> 00:41:30,334
l...

868
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:32,937
So tell me more
about my big future.

869
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:34,536
You have no future.

870
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:38,711
l'll see to it that you spend
the rest of your life in prison.

871
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:40,117
No.

872
00:41:40,153 --> 00:41:41,745
Let me remind you

873
00:41:41,788 --> 00:41:44,382
that taking business advice
from a female

874
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:46,392
is a violation of Ferengi law.

875
00:41:46,426 --> 00:41:48,587
l didn't know she was a female.

876
00:41:48,628 --> 00:41:50,425
Stupidity is no excuse.

877
00:41:50,463 --> 00:41:52,055
Now, one more word out of you

878
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:54,089
and you are going
to share her cell.

879
00:41:54,134 --> 00:41:56,329
Then, you better make sure
it's big enough for three.

880
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:57,666
Are you threatening me?

881
00:41:57,704 --> 00:41:59,763
l wonder
what your associates will say

882
00:41:59,806 --> 00:42:02,832
when l tell them you allowed
a female to represent you

883
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:04,138
in a business negotiation.

884
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:05,667
l didn't know
she was a female.

885
00:42:05,712 --> 00:42:07,976
Stupidity is no excuse.

886
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,243
l see your point.

887
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:14,310
lt seems that Pel's identity

888
00:42:14,354 --> 00:42:16,914
will have to remain
our little secret

889
00:42:17,023 --> 00:42:19,154
but it's going to cost you.

890
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,450
My Gamma Quadrant profits.

891
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:26,085
l've always said you were
a bright fellow, Quark.

892
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:33,963
Shame on you!

893
00:42:39,274 --> 00:42:41,868
l hope you're satisfied.

894
00:42:51,953 --> 00:42:54,786
l'm sorry...

895
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:55,881
but it's time you learned

896
00:42:55,924 --> 00:42:57,789
that when it comes
to accumulating profit

897
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:59,851
women are as capable as men.

898
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:04,354
Well, do me a favor
and don't tell anybody else.

899
00:43:07,569 --> 00:43:10,697
l should go.

900
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:14,505
l've booked passage
on an Andorian transport.

901
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:17,340
You could come with me.

902
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,643
l can't.

903
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,607
l know.

904
00:43:32,594 --> 00:43:35,893
Well, then, l guess
if l can't have you

905
00:43:35,997 --> 00:43:40,024
l'll take those ten bars
of latinum after all.

906
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:56,877
So, Lieutenant...

907
00:43:56,918 --> 00:43:59,443
you ready for another
night of <i>tongo?</i>

908
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:01,819
Haven't you lost enough
for one day?

909
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:03,653
l don't know
what you're talking about.

910
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:05,819
l'm talking about Pel.

911
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,852
She came by to see me
before she left.

912
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,421
l'm going to miss her.

913
00:44:10,465 --> 00:44:11,989
So are you.

914
00:44:12,033 --> 00:44:15,298
You really think l'd let anyone
come between us?

915
00:44:15,337 --> 00:44:17,464
Nice try, Quark

916
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:19,405
but l know you better than that.
