1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,498
You wanted to see me,
Commander?

2
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:11,024
Actually, what l'd like to see
is next month's duty roster.

3
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:15,435
You'll have it on your desk
first thing in the morning.

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:16,964
That's what you said yesterday.

5
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:18,135
l know.

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,872
l just spent the whole
day yesterday...

7
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:22,709
Talking to Minister Rozahn

8
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:25,012
about irrigating
the Trilar Peninsula.

9
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:27,085
How did you know?

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,178
lt's hard to keep
a secret in Ops--

11
00:00:29,254 --> 00:00:30,721
especially when you've
been shouting

12
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:32,223
at a monitor
for the last two days.

13
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:36,091
Thought l kept it down
to an angry whisper.

14
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:38,824
Let's just say
that your voice carries.

15
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:41,958
Every time l talk
to one of the ministers

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,663
l promise myself, l'm not
going to lose control.

17
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:49,765
But then they give me
some stupid bureaucratic excuse

18
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,537
for why something
isn't getting done

19
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:53,100
and l get so...

20
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:55,113
-so...
-Frustrated.

21
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:58,207
Oh, Commander,
l am way beyond frustrated.

22
00:00:58,283 --> 00:00:59,773
Bajor is in trouble.

23
00:00:59,818 --> 00:01:01,183
l just want to help.

24
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,915
l can understand that,
and l sympathize.

25
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:05,252
As far as l'm concerned

26
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,521
you can shout at the provisional
government all you want to

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,084
as long as it doesn't interfere

28
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:11,993
with your duties
here on the station.

29
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,992
You're right.

30
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,866
l'll get on that report
right away.

31
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,675
Oh, Major.

32
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,301
Quark's been looking for you.

33
00:01:25,344 --> 00:01:26,538
He says it's urgent.

34
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,706
Perfect.

35
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,843
Huh?

36
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:38,679
l hear you've been trying
to get in touch with me.

37
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:39,877
You hear right.

38
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,180
Look around you.

39
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:43,687
Does anything seem
to be amiss?

40
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:46,987
That sonata Varani
is playing is lovely.

41
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:49,016
Your customers
seem to be enjoying him.

42
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,186
Why be modest, Major?

43
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:51,820
They're not just
enjoying him

44
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:53,353
they're mesmerized by him.

45
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:54,422
So?

46
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,990
So, while they're
being mesmerized

47
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:58,002
they're not gambling,
they're not eating

48
00:02:58,036 --> 00:02:59,196
they're barely drinking.

49
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,829
Profits are down
across the board.

50
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:03,636
He just started yesterday.

51
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:06,143
l monitor my gross
income hourly.

52
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:08,439
My hourly figures
become my indicators.

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,675
My indicators
become my projections.

54
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:14,742
And my projections--
based on the last 26 hours--

55
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:17,152
show an unprecedented
decline in profits.

56
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,487
Will you stop overreacting!

57
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,790
When people hear
how wonderful Varani is

58
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,160
they'll come
beating down your door.

59
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,925
What are you basing
that projection on?

60
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,159
Bajoran intuition?

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,963
That and a strip of latinum
will get you

62
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,730
a couple of spins
at the dabo wheel.

63
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,466
You promised me you would
try him out for a month.

64
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,406
lf my projections hold true

65
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:38,966
in a month, l'll be
out of business.

66
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,638
Quark, you are going to do this.

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,170
What for?

68
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:45,215
Because l asked you to.

69
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:52,720
Maybe he could play
something with a little more...

70
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:54,190
bounce to it.

71
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,419
Bounce?

72
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:58,053
For a change of pace.

73
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:10,300
That was beautiful.

74
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:13,311
Having my work
appreciated again--

75
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:16,143
l've almost forgotten
how it feels.

76
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:17,876
Granted, it's not quite

77
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,476
the exhibition halls
you're used to.

78
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,781
Ah, one can't be choosy

79
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,754
about performance
venues these days.

80
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:25,119
l just spoke with Quark.

81
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:26,623
He likes what you're doing

82
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:29,354
but he's hoping you'll play
a variety of styles.

83
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,419
A little less exhibition hall

84
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:34,057
a little more music hall,
is that it?

85
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,590
Something like that.

86
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:39,263
l think l can accommodate him.

87
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:41,670
Dabo!

88
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:47,008
l'd love to hear you play
in a more appropriate setting.

89
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:49,411
Have you spoken
to Minister Bolka

90
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:52,473
about my idea to rebuild
the Jalanda Forum?

91
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:54,610
l mentioned it to him.

92
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:57,281
He's got a lot on his mind.

93
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:58,880
You must keep trying.

94
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,257
Bajorans must reclaim
their artistic heritage

95
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:06,321
if they ever hope to regain
their sense of self-worth.

96
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:10,130
Next time l talk to the
Minister, l'll bring it up again

97
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,294
but l can't promise anything.

98
00:05:19,344 --> 00:05:20,504
Ah, Major.

99
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:22,274
Get everything settled
with Quark?

100
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:25,681
Oh, that little toad is this far
from doing a 360 out an airlock.

101
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:27,309
l'm glad to hear
everything went okay.

102
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:30,150
Commander, sensors are picking
up elevated neutrino readings.

103
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:31,815
A ship's coming
through the wormhole.

104
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:33,255
On screen.

105
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,294
Sensors are detecting
four life-forms on board.

106
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:41,492
l'm reading a plasma leak
in their engine core.

107
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,659
Hail them.

108
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,328
No response.

109
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:45,836
The reactor's overheating.

110
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,701
Life support is
barely functioning.

111
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:49,297
Get them out of there, Chief.

112
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:50,740
Aye, sir.

113
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,216
l'm Commander Sisko

114
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:06,223
of the United
Federation of Planets.

115
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:07,918
You've just been
beamed aboard

116
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,586
a Bajoran space station.

117
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:11,289
We don't mean you any harm.

118
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:12,469
We're going to bring
your ship in.

119
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:14,063
Once it's docked

120
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,075
we'll diagnose its problems
and hopefully fix them.

121
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,169
After that,
you can be on your way.

122
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:22,306
l can offer medical
assistance for that wound.

123
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:24,873
<i>Oo-mata! Oo-mata!</i>

124
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:28,318

<i>Skrreea.</i>

132
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,062
Does anyone understand
what she's saying?

133
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:45,400
Something must be wrong with
the universal translator.

134
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:46,530
Chief?

135
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:48,039
lt's working, Commander

136
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:50,474
but for some reason,
it's having a hard time

137
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,341
analyzing
their language patterns.

138
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:54,778
Their syntax
and their grammatical structure

139
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:57,612
must be completely unlike
anything in our database.

140
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,947
We'll have to keep them talking

141
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:02,148
until the computer can establish
a translation matrix.

142
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:03,177

<i>Fenta?</i>

148
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:12,995
Keeping them talking
shouldn't be much of a problem.

<i>Oobay a-tal?</i>

151
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,500
Major, we've got to get them
down to the lnfirmary.

152
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,908
They seem to be
most comfortable with you.

153
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:27,174
Why don't you lead the way?

154
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,373
A-All right.

155
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:32,248
Um... we're going to take
a little ride on the turbolift.

156
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:38,247
Toma.

157
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,191
Bessa.

158
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:43,525
Sisko to Odo.

159
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:44,860
Yes, Commander.

160
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:46,489
We're bringing some new arrivals

161
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:48,864
from the Gamma Quadrant
down to the Promenade.

162
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,198
Meet us at Turbolift 9.

163
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:52,534
l'm on my way.

164
00:09:58,244 --> 00:09:59,438
We're here.

165
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,879
You can come out now.

166
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:04,576
There's no need to be afraid.

167
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:05,584
Come on.

168
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:07,017
lt's all right.

169
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:09,044
What seems to be the trouble,
Commander?

170
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:10,749
The computer's
having a hard time

171
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,121
translating their language.

172
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:14,058
l can see how that
would be a problem.

173
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:15,424
lt's okay.

174
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:16,792
Come on.

175
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:37,416
Hold on!

176
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,748
Let's stick together.

177
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:41,117
No wandering off.

178
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:45,250
Now you just stay put
while l round up your friend.

179
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,986
Uh, let me try.

180
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:49,119
Come with me.

181
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:59,165
Hello.

00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:03,368

183
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:04,808
Dress.

184
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:06,869
lt's called a dress.

185
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:08,210

186
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:09,544
<i>lntaowa?</i>

187
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:12,710
Uh, l'm afraid
you'll have to put that back.

188
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:13,719

189
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:14,720

191
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:17,315
Do you like it?

192
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:19,756
Yes, it's very nice,
but it's not yours.

193
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,350
And that, that goes
for you, too.

194
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:24,591
Major, perhaps you'd
better handle this.

195
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,722
All right.

196
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:28,325
Let's put those back--
both of you.

197
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,961
They really need
to put those back.

198
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:32,800
We can go shopping later

199
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,330
but right now,
it's very important

200
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:37,501
that we go to the lnfirmary.

201
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:39,374
So, everyone, follow me.

202
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:41,073
We'll all go together.

203
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:42,740

209
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,463
Hmm, there's no doubt
who the boss is.

210
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,866
How bad is it, Doctor?

211
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:06,531
Looks like a second-degree
plasma burn.

212
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:09,200
The dermal regenerator
should take care of it.

213
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,110
l'm sorry.

214
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:15,044
l'm not the doctor.

215
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:16,412
<i>Kolat gadoux?</i>

216
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,246
l assure you...

217
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:21,712
l will not hurt him.

218
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:23,745
He's going to be all right.

219
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:29,822
These will be your quarters

220
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:31,386
while you're here
at the station.

221
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,658
l'm sure you want to rest

222
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:34,791
and clean up and...
you don't understand

223
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,927
anything l'm saying, do you?

224
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:41,773
l know something
they might understand.

225
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:46,143
Seven maaza stalks.

226
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:56,012
This is food.

227
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:58,615
Please, try one.

228
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:03,220
Major, show them it's okay.

229
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:07,396
See.

230
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:09,778
Mmm.

231
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:12,675
Mmm, it's really very good.

232
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:42,810
Mmm...

233
00:13:42,844 --> 00:13:44,675
l'm glad you like them.

Wait.

246
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:07,161
Did you hear that?

247
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:08,863
l think she said ''need.''

248
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:10,269

My people need your help.

262
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:38,665
There's no time to waste.

263
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,962
Your people are the Skrreea.

264
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,059
You need our help.

265
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:42,501
There's no time to waste.

266
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:45,466
Your people-- where are they?

267
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:48,408
They are on the <i>creshnee</i>
side of the Eye.

268
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:49,501
The ''Eye?''

269
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:51,444
The Eye of the Universe.

270
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:52,969
The tunnel.

271
00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:55,676
l think she means the wormhole.

272
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:57,651
They are on the other side.

273
00:14:57,686 --> 00:15:00,177
They don't realize
we found the Eye.

274
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:02,849
How many people
are we talking about?

275
00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:05,917
Many... three <i>jeetaka.</i>

276
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:07,519
Three hundred?

277
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:09,621
Three thousand?

278
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:12,030
Three million?

279
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,397
Three million.

280
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:16,962
Three million of my people
are on the other side.

281
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:19,667
We must bring them
through the Eye.

282
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,608
We must bring them here.

283
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:37,689
l-ls there anything wrong?

284
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:40,854
l'm just not used
to the men being here.

285
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:43,056
Skrreean men don't
involve themselves

286
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:44,895
in situations like this.

287
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,730
Are all your leaders women?

288
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:47,735
Yes.

289
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:49,236
All of them?

290
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,237
You heard her, Julian.

291
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,569
Men are far too emotional
to be leaders.

292
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:55,508
They're constantly
fighting among themselves.

293
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:57,636
lt's their favorite thing to do.

294
00:15:59,014 --> 00:16:00,038
l'm sorry.

295
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:02,015
l hope l haven't
offended anyone.

296
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:06,854
Sorry to keep you waiting.

297
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:08,116
lt's all right, Benjamin.

298
00:16:08,156 --> 00:16:09,555
Haneek was just telling us

299
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:11,991
how the Skrreea are
a female-dominant society.

300
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:14,860
lt seems the men are a bit
too emotional to be leaders.

301
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:17,296
Please do not misunderstand.

302
00:16:17,332 --> 00:16:18,731
We love our men.

303
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:22,703
Really!

304
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:25,797
Are you one of the leaders
of your people, Haneek?

305
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,307
Me?

306
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:29,037
Oh, no.

307
00:16:29,144 --> 00:16:31,977
l'm little more than a farmer.

308
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:33,605
l was just lucky.

309
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:35,275
How so?

310
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:38,183
l was the first one to find
the Eye of the Universe.

311
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:40,653
You were looking
for the wormhole?

312
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:43,418
We had heard about a great
tunnel being discovered.

313
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,688
We knew it must be
the Eye of the Universe

314
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:47,388
that would lead us to Kentanna.

315
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:49,226
Kentanna?

316
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:52,427
Kentanna is the legendary
home of the Skrreeans.

317
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:55,698
lt has always been portrayed
in our sacred texts

318
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:58,706
as being just beyond
the Eye of the Universe.

319
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,174
A planet of sorrow,
where the Skrreean will sow

320
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:03,473
seeds of joy.

321
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:05,843
l can't guarantee
you'll find Kentanna.

322
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,179
But l can promise you
that we'll help you find a home.

323
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:10,878
We sent our runabouts

324
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,444
to the Gamma Quadrant
to make contact with your ships.

325
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:15,251
That will be difficult.

326
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,555
They're all spread out
looking for the Eye.

327
00:17:18,593 --> 00:17:21,027
And when we find them--
what then?

328
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:23,893
This station
only holds 7,000 people.

329
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:27,333
You're talking about
three million Skrreeans.

330
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:29,199
l'm afraid most of your people

331
00:17:29,237 --> 00:17:31,637
will have to be confined
to their ships.

332
00:17:31,673 --> 00:17:32,640
l understand.

333
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:33,971
ln the meantime

334
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:36,806
is there any one person
we should be looking for?

335
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:39,211
A leader or leaders?

336
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:42,273
Most of our leaders were
killed by the T-Rogorans.

337
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:44,512
The T-Rogorans.
Who are they?

338
00:17:44,552 --> 00:17:47,749
For eight centuries, my people
have lived under their rule.

339
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:50,690
We have been forced to work
as laborers and servants.

340
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:51,919
We were able to escape

341
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,520
when the T-Rogorans were invaded
and conquered.

342
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:56,052
Who conquered them?

343
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:57,962
l do not know their name.

344
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:00,229
l only know they were members

345
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:02,930
of something called
''The Dominion.''

346
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:20,411
Did l wake you?

347
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:21,922
Oh, that's all right.

348
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:23,014
Please, come in.

349
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:24,854
Computer, lights on full.

350
00:18:24,893 --> 00:18:26,520
l can come back.

351
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:27,823
No.

352
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:29,762
You've been so kind to me.

353
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:32,891
How could l possibly
refuse your company?

354
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:38,202
Go back to bed.

355
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,365
Go on!

356
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:40,533
Go on.

357
00:18:40,575 --> 00:18:42,736
l'll join you again
after l'm through.

358
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:49,141
Are those your husbands?

359
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:50,947
Hus-bands?

360
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:53,613
l'm not familiar with that word.

361
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:55,384
They're bonded to me.

362
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:59,382
Do you sleep with them both?

363
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:00,394
Of course.

364
00:19:00,428 --> 00:19:02,555
Don't you sleep with your males?

365
00:19:02,597 --> 00:19:04,929
No, l don't have any males.

366
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:09,332
Not at the moment, anyway.

367
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,736
They're very useful.

368
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:14,173
Yes, l can imagine they are.

369
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:18,908
l just wanted to tell you,
we found some of your ships.

370
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:21,006
Several hundred
Skrreeans should be

371
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:22,812
arriving at the station today.

372
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,215
We thought it would be
a good idea

373
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:25,617
if you were there to greet them.

374
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:27,712
Why me?

375
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:30,747
You yourself said most
of your leaders were dead.

376
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:36,355
Yes, that's true,
but, Kira, l'm just a farmer.

377
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:39,594
You also were the first one
through the Eye of the Universe.

378
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:42,899
That's got to mean something...
in some symbolic sort of way.

379
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:48,035
Oh, here.

380
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:50,167
l brought you something.

381
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:51,906
Go ahead, open it.

382
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:58,579
You seemed to like it.

383
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:06,390
l'm sorry.

384
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:09,294
l think you misunderstood.

385
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,888
What do you mean?

386
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:14,993
l thought this was
the most hideous thing

387
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:16,162
l'd ever seen.

388
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:20,468
Well, that makes two of us.

389
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,975
lt's awful.

390
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:26,488
lt's horrible.

391
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:29,818
Who would wear that?

392
00:20:43,405 --> 00:20:44,895
lt was no big deal.

393
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,467
You go on a date with a dabo
girl for the first time

394
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,705
and you sit there and tell me
it was no big deal?

395
00:20:50,745 --> 00:20:52,372
lt wasn't really a date.

396
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:54,712
Does your father know
you went out with her?

397
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:56,046
Not exactly.

398
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:57,312
He doesn't?

399
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:59,820
l told him l had to help
someone with her homework.

400
00:20:59,854 --> 00:21:01,048
Good thinking.

401
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:03,590
Too bad l'll never
be able to use that lie.

402
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,650
My dad knows
l never do homework.

403
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:06,661
lt's not a lie, Nog.

404
00:21:06,695 --> 00:21:07,992
Mardah's studying entomology.

405
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:09,360
She asked me to help her out.

406
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:12,195
A dabo girl
who studies entomology?

407
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,666
Ha! Sure.

408
00:21:13,702 --> 00:21:14,999
lt's true.

409
00:21:15,036 --> 00:21:16,367
Yeah.

410
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:20,936
What is entomology?

411
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:22,238
The study of bugs.

412
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:26,111
Oh, you mean
she wants to be a chef?

413
00:21:27,882 --> 00:21:28,906
Hey, who's that?

414
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,713
l don't know.

415
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:34,752
What's he doing?

416
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:37,019
Oh, that's disgusting!

417
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:38,992
He must be
one of those Skrreeans.

418
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:41,461
My dad says there's
a lot more on the way.

419
00:21:44,265 --> 00:21:45,562
Hi!

420
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:49,998
Doesn't he know
what a replicator's for?

421
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:51,369
ldiot!

422
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:56,173
So, does Mardah
have any sisters?

423
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:04,309
Commander, l've cleared
the Skrreean ship

424
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:05,876
to dock at Upper Pylon 2.

425
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,879
lt's time to welcome your people
to the Alpha Quadrant, Haneek.

426
00:22:22,203 --> 00:22:25,229
Come along, don't be afraid.

427
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:27,503
Come on, it's all right.

428
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:29,237
You're among friends.

429
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:30,767
Don't be afraid.

430
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:33,838
lt's all right.
lt's all right.

431
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:18,188
Slow down!

432
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:20,194
There's no running
on the Promenade.

433
00:23:20,228 --> 00:23:21,991
lt's going to get
awfully crowded

434
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:23,360
around here, Commander.

435
00:23:23,398 --> 00:23:25,992
l know, Constable,
but it's worth it.

436
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:27,364
Just look at them.

437
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:31,031
They're experiencing
their first taste of freedom.

438
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:40,840
Nog, where you going?

439
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:42,406
Can't talk now.
Gotta run!

440
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,474
Nog!

441
00:23:43,518 --> 00:23:46,578
You know there's no running
on the Promenade.

442
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:47,986
Who's running?

443
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:50,684
What seems to be
the problem here?

444
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:52,317
What's that smell?

445
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,486
Ask him.

446
00:23:53,528 --> 00:23:54,495
Me?

447
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:55,655
You're the one who stinks.

448
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:57,790
That's because you sprayed
that vapor on us.

449
00:23:57,832 --> 00:23:59,527
ls that true, Nog?

450
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,330
No!

451
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:03,234
Nog...

452
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:06,565
lt was a joke.

453
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:08,200
Very amusing.

454
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:10,575
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention.

455
00:24:10,612 --> 00:24:12,443
l'll take care of it from here.

456
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:19,286
This isn't over yet, big ears.

457
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:33,158
Hey, here's a new one.

458
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:37,001
What kind of name is
''Plix Tixiplik?''

459
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:39,165
l believe he's a Reegrunion.

460
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:46,807
''Wanted in seven star systems
for illegal weapon sales.''

461
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,577
Weapon sales, huh?

462
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:50,140
Very profitable.

463
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:52,380
How would you know about that?

464
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,445
My Uncle Quark told me.

465
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:59,984
And what would your Uncle Quark
know about illegal weapon sales?

466
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:02,462
He, uh... he, uh...

467
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:03,896
Knows better than to ever

468
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:06,867
get involved in anything
so disreputable.

469
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:08,391
l'm sure.

470
00:25:08,436 --> 00:25:11,735
l asked that the boy's father
come to see me.

471
00:25:11,773 --> 00:25:13,968
Rom is doing
the weekly stock inventory.

472
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:15,600
l don't want to interrupt him.

473
00:25:15,643 --> 00:25:17,474
You know how easy
he loses count.

474
00:25:17,512 --> 00:25:20,072
So, l came in his place.

475
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:22,412
Nog, have you been
causing mischief again?

476
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,576
No, Uncle.

477
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:24,983
lt's all a misunderstanding.

478
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:26,316
He sprayed

479
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:29,380
several Skrreean boys
with a foul-smelling vapor.

480
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:30,413
Did he?

481
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:34,186
What do you have
to say for yourself?

482
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:36,424
l-l'm sorry...?

483
00:25:36,464 --> 00:25:38,659
You see the boy's
beside himself with guilt.

484
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,260
That doesn't excuse his actions.

485
00:25:41,302 --> 00:25:43,463
And he will be
punished severely.

486
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:44,937
l will?

487
00:25:44,973 --> 00:25:47,840
l want you to tell
the Constable here

488
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:50,367
that you will never do it again.

489
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:51,810
l won't?

490
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:54,480
l mean, l won't.

491
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:55,482
l promise.

492
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:56,608
Never again.

493
00:25:56,651 --> 00:25:58,482
See that you don't.

494
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:01,351
Can l leave now?

495
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,520
Go on.

496
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:12,155
You know, you really
can't blame the boy.

497
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,100
And why is that?

498
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:15,625
Oh, come on, Odo.

499
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,501
You know these Skrreeans
are nothing but trouble.

500
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:19,096
They're all over the station

501
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,338
looking and touching,
never buying anything.

502
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:24,936
And they flake.

503
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:26,241
l didn't notice.

504
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:27,373
Come to my place.

505
00:26:27,415 --> 00:26:30,145
You'll see little pieces
of Skrreean skin

506
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:32,277
all over the bar and the floor.

507
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,378
lt's disgusting.

508
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:35,292
Well, they won't be here long.

509
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:36,289
l hope not.

510
00:26:36,326 --> 00:26:37,953
They're driving
my paying customers away.

511
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:40,223
They stay here too long,
and l'll be out of business.

512
00:26:40,263 --> 00:26:43,721
ln that case,
l hope they never leave.

513
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:06,484
We've talked it over
among ourselves.

514
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:09,856
Our feelings were unanimous.

515
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:13,920
You discovered
the Eye of the Universe.

516
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:19,400
You must lead us
the rest of the way.

517
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:27,610
l'll do the best l can.

518
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:42,687
That looked serious.

519
00:27:42,726 --> 00:27:45,593
ls everything all right?

520
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:49,357
Look at them.

521
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:51,196
Look at my people.

522
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:56,428
l've never seen them so happy

523
00:27:56,473 --> 00:28:00,239
and here l sit, feeling trapped.

524
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:01,744
Why?

525
00:28:01,778 --> 00:28:05,407
They expect me
to lead them to Kentanna.

526
00:28:07,617 --> 00:28:09,244
lt's going to be okay.

527
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:12,380
Commander Sisko is doing
everything he can

528
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:14,549
to find you a place to live.

529
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:16,855
You're not alone.

530
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:18,451
l hope l'm not intruding.

531
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:19,655
Oh, not at all.

532
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:21,664
Haneek, this is Varani,
a great musician.

533
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:24,929
Maybe the greatest
Bajor has ever known.

534
00:28:25,035 --> 00:28:30,200
She exaggerates, but that's
why l'm so fond of her.

535
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:37,403
Being a Bajoran, l know what
it's like to be displaced.

536
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:42,851
As a token of friendship,
l would like to give you this.

537
00:28:48,758 --> 00:28:51,454
lt's from a concert
l played

538
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:55,056
many years ago
at the Jalanda Forum.

539
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:11,576
Tumak, where have you been?

540
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:12,582
Nowhere.

541
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:13,583
Where are you going?

542
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:15,016
To wash.

543
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:27,859
Computer...

544
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:31,095
please show me a chart
of this star system.

545
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:41,067
So, what'd your dad say?

546
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:42,203
About what?

547
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:43,872
About you getting
in trouble with Odo.

548
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:44,903
He was very angry.

549
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:46,040
He was?

550
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:48,448
He always gets angry
when l get caught.

551
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,947
l just remembered.

552
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:54,217
l have some errands
to run for my uncle.

553
00:29:54,257 --> 00:29:56,418
You're going to have
to face them

554
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:57,517
sooner or later.

555
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:59,688
That was very funny,
what you did.

556
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:01,128
You see, Jake?

557
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:04,759
There's a man
with a sense of humor.

558
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:06,860
Nobody's laughing.

559
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:08,768
And luckily nobody got hurt.

560
00:30:08,805 --> 00:30:11,968
l think my friend's real
sorry for what he did.

561
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,607
Aren't you?

562
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:16,976
l suppose.

563
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:18,139
See?

564
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:19,705
What'd l tell you?

565
00:30:19,749 --> 00:30:22,115
He doesn't sound sorry to me.

566
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:39,234
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

567
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:40,634
That's enough.

568
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,864
Break it up.

569
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:43,964
l said, break it up!

570
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,375
lt's bad enough you're
all hanging around the station

571
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:53,643
without buying anything.

572
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:55,344
You have to start fighting, too?

573
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:57,546
l thought we were welcome here.

574
00:30:57,587 --> 00:31:00,681
Well, make yourself welcome
somewhere else.

575
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:02,487
You don't want us here.

576
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:05,358
You don't want anything
to do with us.

577
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:09,263
Well, we don't want anything
to do with you.

578
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,630
Any of you!

579
00:31:16,272 --> 00:31:17,739
l can see the Skrreeans

580
00:31:17,774 --> 00:31:21,005
don't bother
to teach their children manners.

581
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:23,735
Dax and l have been

582
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,475
combing through data
on every uninhabited

583
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:27,244
M-Class planet in the sector.

584
00:31:27,283 --> 00:31:28,750
We think that Draylon ll

585
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:31,310
would make a perfect home
for the Skrreea.

586
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:32,321
Draylon ll?

587
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:34,152
l've never heard of it.

588
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,817
lt's near Sefalla Prime.

589
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,986
lt's got definite possibilities.

590
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:40,258
Stable orbit, temperate climate

591
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:42,560
and a very low
surface radiation.

592
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:45,432
Add to that good soil
and a long growing season.

593
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:47,265
l think it's our best bet.

594
00:31:58,982 --> 00:31:59,949
May we come in?

595
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:01,211
Of course.

596
00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:12,054
Ladies.

597
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:16,529
Forgive them, Commander Sisko.

598
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:18,534
They don't mean any disrespect.

599
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:19,660
l understand.

600
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:21,671
We have some encouraging news.

601
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:23,400
We think we've found a planet

602
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,102
for you and your people,
one with excellent potential

603
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:27,666
for resettlement.

604
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:32,972
We appreciate all your hard work

605
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:35,813
but l'm afraid
it was unnecessary.

606
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:38,184
You see, we found Kentanna.

607
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:40,519
You did?

608
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:42,991
A planet of sorrow, Kira.

609
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:44,458
Don't you see?

610
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:46,894
Kentanna is your planet.

611
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,490
Kentanna is Bajor.

612
00:32:58,174 --> 00:33:02,201
Station Log, Stardate 47391.2.

613
00:33:02,245 --> 00:33:04,873
Chief O'Brien is continuing
to oversee repairs

614
00:33:04,914 --> 00:33:07,075
to the Skrreean ships docked
at the station.

615
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:09,847
Meanwhile, Minister Rozahn
and Vedek Sorad have arrived

616
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:11,911
from Bajor
with an official response

617
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:14,185
to the Skrreeans' request
to immigrate.

618
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:15,953
Major, if l may have a moment?

619
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:16,959
l'm sorry, Varani.

620
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:18,426
l'm on my way to a meeting.

621
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:21,259
l know-- with Minister
Rozahn and Vedek Sorad.

622
00:33:21,297 --> 00:33:23,356
l presume Haneek
will be there as well.

623
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,957
That's right.

624
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:28,767
Please tell here that my heart
goes out to her and her people.

625
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:31,069
Tell her how much
Bajorans everywhere

626
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:32,768
regret having to refuse
their request.

627
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:34,572
Aren't you being
a little premature?

628
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,942
Am l? You know what

629
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:38,413
the provisional government's
answer is going to be.

630
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:41,246
These are people who have
lost everything, Varani.

631
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:44,651
l know, and l wish there was
some way we could help them.

632
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:48,817
But Bajor is in shambles, Kira.

633
00:33:48,858 --> 00:33:51,383
You know that as well as l do.

634
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:56,492
First of all,
l want you all to know

635
00:33:56,533 --> 00:34:00,594
that the provisional government
has taken the Skrreeans' request

636
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:02,605
for immigration very seriously.

637
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:04,937
The debate
in the Chamber of Ministers

638
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,872
became quite heated at times.

639
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,071
Though l suppose
you could say that

640
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:10,704
about all of our debates.

641
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:13,716
But a decision was reached.

642
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,877
Yes, l was sent here to tell you

643
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,650
that the Ministers-- in accord
with the Vedek Assembly--

644
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:23,557
have decided to deny
the Skrreeans' request.

645
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:24,821
l am sorry.

646
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:29,696
Bajor simply cannot absorb three
million refugees at this time.

647
00:34:29,732 --> 00:34:32,496
After what the Cardassians
did to our planet

648
00:34:32,535 --> 00:34:34,429
we can barely
take care of our own.

649
00:34:34,562 --> 00:34:37,122
But no one is asking you
to take care of us.

650
00:34:37,165 --> 00:34:39,531
This decision is not based

651
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:42,627
strictly on Bajoran
self-interest.

652
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,400
Such a huge increase
in population

653
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,307
would prove to be tragic
to your people as well as ours.

654
00:34:48,343 --> 00:34:50,709
But Bajor has more
than enough room for us.

655
00:34:50,745 --> 00:34:52,804
The plains
of the Northwest Peninsula

656
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:54,405
are practically uninhabited.

657
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:56,110
The land's ideal for farming.

658
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,447
lt used to be

659
00:34:57,485 --> 00:35:00,420
before the Cardassians
got their hands on it.

660
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:03,891
Minister Rozahn,
the Skrreea are farmers.

661
00:35:03,992 --> 00:35:05,892
Just give us the land.

662
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,760
l guarantee you,
we can make it thrive again.

663
00:35:09,797 --> 00:35:12,664
Under ideal circumstances,
perhaps you could.

664
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,430
But what if the circumstances
aren't ideal?

665
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:18,234
What if we go through
another long winter?

666
00:35:18,273 --> 00:35:19,831
What if your crops fail?

667
00:35:19,874 --> 00:35:21,068
What if the famine

668
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:24,340
that has been plaguing Bajor
continues to spread?

669
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:25,676
What then?

670
00:35:25,713 --> 00:35:28,375
We are willing
to take that risk.

671
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,008
l'm afraid we aren't.

672
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:31,882
We ran a series of projections

673
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,014
to see whether a Skrreean
settlement could survive

674
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:36,717
on the Northwest peninsula.

675
00:35:36,758 --> 00:35:38,851
The results were
not encouraging.

676
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:40,690
Haneek?

677
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:42,662
l think you should
seriously consider

678
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:44,597
Draylon ll as an alternate
to Bajor.

679
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:45,758
The winters are mild.

680
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,563
There's plenty of good farmland.

681
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:50,469
No!
Projections can be wrong.

682
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:52,939
But what if they're not?

683
00:35:53,007 --> 00:35:56,670
What is Bajor to do
if your people start dying?

684
00:35:56,711 --> 00:35:58,474
l thought l made that clear.

685
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:00,504
We are not expecting your help.

686
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:03,813
Do you really think we could
stand by and do nothing?

687
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:07,287
We would feel obligated to help
with food, with clothing

688
00:36:07,322 --> 00:36:09,017
with whatever it would take.

689
00:36:09,057 --> 00:36:11,218
And where would
that aid come from?

690
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:13,989
Our resources
are already depleted.

691
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:17,794
To help you would mean
depriving our own people.

692
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:19,163
l am afraid the decision

693
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,067
of the provisional government
is final.

694
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:25,698
The Skrreea will have
to find somewhere else to live.

695
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:31,074
Please, talk to them.

696
00:36:31,112 --> 00:36:33,103
Tell them they're wrong.

697
00:36:35,016 --> 00:36:36,711
Help us.

698
00:36:39,754 --> 00:36:41,244
l can't.

699
00:36:43,057 --> 00:36:44,854
l'm sorry, Haneek...

700
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:46,416
but they're right.

701
00:36:46,461 --> 00:36:48,224
l wish they weren't.

702
00:36:48,262 --> 00:36:51,789
l wish Bajor was Kentanna.

703
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,858
But it's not.

704
00:36:56,437 --> 00:37:00,430
There's still Draylon ll.

705
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:11,112
Ooh!

706
00:37:11,152 --> 00:37:12,619
Look at this!

707
00:37:18,593 --> 00:37:19,651
Excuse me.

708
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:22,162
lf you like cake

709
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:23,788
the icoberry torte
is really good.

710
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:26,823
ls that big-eared troll
really your friend?

711
00:37:26,868 --> 00:37:28,768
Yeah.
He's an idiot.

712
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:30,896
You're not the first
to say that.

713
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:33,907
But he's not such a bad guy
once you get to know him.

714
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:36,067
l don't plan on being
around here that long.

715
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,375
My dad says you're probably
going to Draylon ll.

716
00:37:39,414 --> 00:37:40,506
Does he?

717
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:42,914
Yeah, sounds like a nice place.

718
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,349
Do you want to move there?

719
00:37:44,385 --> 00:37:45,579
No.

720
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,145
Neither do l.

721
00:37:55,563 --> 00:37:56,928
Come in.

722
00:38:04,472 --> 00:38:06,201
Haneek...

723
00:38:07,942 --> 00:38:11,207
The thing l don't understand
is why you pretended

724
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:12,303
to be my friend.

725
00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:14,837
l wasn't pretending.

726
00:38:14,882 --> 00:38:16,042
Ahh!

727
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:18,882
So you are my friend...

728
00:38:18,986 --> 00:38:21,147
until l need you.

729
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:27,654
l know it's hard
for you to see right now

730
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:29,253
but l am trying to help.

731
00:38:29,297 --> 00:38:31,993
l think l've had quite enough
of your help.

732
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:33,193
You've got to believe me.

733
00:38:33,234 --> 00:38:36,135
Commander Sisko
has found you a wonderful home.

734
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,037
You betrayed me, Kira.

735
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:40,370
No, l didn't.

736
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:43,172
l honestly believe
the provisional government

737
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:44,838
made the right decision

738
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:47,143
both for Bajor
and the Skrreeans.

739
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:50,673
lf that's true,
we have nothing more to discuss.

740
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:56,883
l was hoping
we could still be friends.

741
00:38:56,924 --> 00:39:02,385
So in other words, you came here
looking for forgiveness.

742
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,024
Well, l don't forgive you.

743
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:08,835
Sisko to Kira.

744
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,565
Go ahead, Commander.

745
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:11,629
ls Haneek with you?

746
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:12,866
Yes.

747
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:15,067
l need both of you
in Ops immediately.

748
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:16,974
Tumak has taken a ship.

749
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:18,876
He's headed for Bajor.

750
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:36,857
They're not responding, sir.

751
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:38,331
Keep trying, Mr. O'Brien.

752
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:39,526
How did this happen?

753
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:41,296
With all the traffic
around the station

754
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:43,735
Tumak and two of his friends
were able to slip away.

755
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:45,534
We didn't even know
the ship was gone

756
00:39:45,573 --> 00:39:47,131
until the Bajorans contacted us.

757
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:50,508
Haneek, l need for you
to try to talk to your son.

758
00:39:50,545 --> 00:39:53,241
There's a high-energy radiation
leak in the port nacelle.

759
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:54,873
l've tried
to make him aware of it

760
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,349
but he refuses
to acknowledge us.

761
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:58,784
Major, open a channel
to the Skrreean vessel.

762
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,014
Yes, sir.

763
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:03,450
Ready.

764
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,121
Tumak?

765
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,122
Listen to me.

766
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:14,225
Your ship's in danger.

767
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:18,438
Have him turn off
his engines and drift

768
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:20,702
until the Bajorans
can tractor him in.

769
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:24,438
Tumak, turn off your engines.

770
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:28,938
You must turn
your engines off, now!

771
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:30,950
He's not responding.

772
00:40:31,018 --> 00:40:33,680
Tumak, this is serious!

773
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:35,348
Your life is in danger.

774
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:38,324
The others who are with you,
their lives are in danger.

775
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:39,326
Please!

776
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,486
Answer me!

777
00:40:42,463 --> 00:40:44,363
Sensors are detecting
two Bajoran vessels

778
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:45,956
closing in on the Skrreean ship.

779
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,399
Display it here.

780
00:40:47,435 --> 00:40:50,165
Mr. O'Brien, patch us
into the Bajoran interceptor.

781
00:40:50,204 --> 00:40:51,535
Aye, sir.

782
00:40:51,572 --> 00:40:53,130
...entered restricted space.

783
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:55,267
You must turn around
and leave immediately.

784
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:56,571
Open a channel.

785
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:58,670
This is Major Kira
Nerys on Deep Space 9.

786
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:01,648
The Skrreean vessel has refused
to acknowledge our hails.

787
00:41:01,682 --> 00:41:04,480
Communications may be down.
You have to let them land.

788
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:05,917
That's impossible, Major.

789
00:41:05,953 --> 00:41:07,420
We have strict orders
not to allow

790
00:41:07,455 --> 00:41:08,717
any Skrreean vessel to land.

791
00:41:08,756 --> 00:41:09,882
The pilot's just a boy.

792
00:41:09,924 --> 00:41:11,687
He took the ship
without permission.

793
00:41:11,726 --> 00:41:13,159
lt's barely operational.

794
00:41:13,194 --> 00:41:15,025
We're not even sure
he'll make it back here.

795
00:41:15,062 --> 00:41:17,189
l'm sorry, Major,
but we have our orders.

796
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:18,198
Who gave you those orders?

797
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:19,699
They come directly
from General Hazar.

798
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:21,861
Dax, get me General Hazar
on Bajor.

799
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:24,030
Tell his people
it's an emergency.

800
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:25,538
l want to speak to him now.

801
00:41:25,573 --> 00:41:26,540
Stand by, interceptor.

802
00:41:26,574 --> 00:41:28,201
General Hazar will be
countermanding

803
00:41:28,242 --> 00:41:29,334
those orders any minute.

804
00:41:29,377 --> 00:41:31,345
The interceptor is closing
on the Skrreean ship.

805
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:37,283
lt's General Hazar, Benjamin.

806
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:38,615
On screen.

807
00:41:38,653 --> 00:41:40,450
What is this about, Commander?

808
00:41:40,488 --> 00:41:43,150
lt's about the Skrreean vessel
that's approaching Bajor.

809
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,658
l've already given the orders
to have it turned back.

810
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:48,093
That ship is being flown
by a child

811
00:41:48,129 --> 00:41:49,858
and it's leaking radiation.

812
00:41:49,897 --> 00:41:50,955
A child?

813
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:52,294
...Skrreean ship.
Repeating.

814
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,801
Return to the space station now.

815
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:56,632
Have him shut down his engines.

816
00:41:56,671 --> 00:41:57,797
We'll tow him back.

817
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,468
Tumak, please,
turn your engines off.

818
00:42:03,611 --> 00:42:04,908
lnterceptor One,
what's going on?

819
00:42:04,946 --> 00:42:07,176
They've opened fire on us.
Taking evasive action.

820
00:42:07,214 --> 00:42:09,205
Tumak, don't do this!

821
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,683
We've been hit!

822
00:42:10,718 --> 00:42:12,242
Commander,
they're returning fire.

823
00:42:12,286 --> 00:42:13,583
No!

824
00:42:13,621 --> 00:42:16,089
Disengage, interceptor!
Repeat, disengage.

825
00:42:16,123 --> 00:42:19,149
General, tell your pilots
to hold their fire.

826
00:42:19,193 --> 00:42:21,889
Relaying that order now.

827
00:42:30,404 --> 00:42:31,632
lnterceptor One.

828
00:42:31,672 --> 00:42:33,833
The Skrreean ship exploded.

829
00:42:33,874 --> 00:42:36,274
l didn't even think we hit it.

830
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:40,041
The phaser beam must've
ignited the radiation leak.

831
00:42:42,283 --> 00:42:45,116
l'm very sorry, Commander.

832
00:42:45,152 --> 00:42:47,882
We all are, General.

833
00:43:20,652 --> 00:43:23,314
l just stopped by to wish
you luck on Draylon ll.

834
00:43:23,355 --> 00:43:28,486
Haneek, l still believe
this is the best choice...

835
00:43:28,526 --> 00:43:30,858
for Bajor and for you.

836
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:32,123
You still believe

837
00:43:32,163 --> 00:43:34,188
we would have been a burden
to your people?

838
00:43:35,934 --> 00:43:37,458
Yes.

839
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:40,801
l think you've made
a terrible mistake.

840
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:41,806
All of you.

841
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,865
Maybe we could
have helped you.

842
00:43:43,908 --> 00:43:46,468
Maybe we could have
helped each other.

843
00:43:46,511 --> 00:43:48,809
The Skrreeans are farmers, Kira.

844
00:43:48,847 --> 00:43:51,247
You have a famine
on your planet.

845
00:43:51,282 --> 00:43:55,275
Perhaps we could have made
that peninsula bloom again.

846
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,914
We'll never know, will we?

847
00:43:57,989 --> 00:44:00,822
50 years of Cardassian rule

848
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:05,387
have made you all frightened
and suspicious.

849
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,694
l feel sorry for you.

850
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:14,504
You were right.

851
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:17,770
Bajor is not Kentanna.
