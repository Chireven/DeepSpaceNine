1
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:05,158
Last time on <i>Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:08,059
This is the emblem of
the Alliance for Global Unity.

3
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:09,858
They call themselves the Circle.

4
00:00:09,897 --> 00:00:12,024
What gives them the right
to mess up our station?

5
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:13,966
They're an extremist faction

6
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,401
who believe in Bajor
for the Bajorans.

7
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:18,166
l can't loan you
a Starfleet runabout

8
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:20,469
without knowing
where you plan on taking it.

9
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:21,839
To Cardassia lV

10
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:24,242
to rescue
a Bajoran prisoner of war.

11
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:30,741
Come on, we have a ship waiting.

12
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:32,878
What if l told you
that l knew someone

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,979
who could bring stability
to Bajor?

14
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:37,354
Someone who could
unite the factions

15
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:38,983
and give us a chance
to do our job.

16
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:41,620
But Bajor doesn't need a man.

17
00:00:41,662 --> 00:00:43,789
lt needs a symbol

18
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:46,061
and that's what you are.

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,467
Li Nalas needed to return here
to assume his new post.

20
00:00:49,503 --> 00:00:52,904
He's been made the Bajoran
Liaison Officer to Deep Space 9.

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,568
l already have
a Liaison Officer.

22
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,202
Not anymore, you don't.

23
00:00:57,311 --> 00:01:00,474
Major Kira is no longer
assigned to this post.

24
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:02,482
She's been recalled to Bajor.

25
00:01:02,516 --> 00:01:04,848
lt's over, everything.

26
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:06,409
Bajor, the provisional
government

27
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:08,285
the Federation being here--
all of it.

28
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:09,721
We got to leave.

29
00:01:09,757 --> 00:01:12,385
The provisional government
will stand only if the military

30
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:13,791
supports it.

31
00:01:13,828 --> 00:01:15,796
We are all patriots, Commander.

32
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,161
l am the Circle, Major.

33
00:01:17,198 --> 00:01:19,894
How can you
betray your own government?

34
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:29,604
The Circle's being supplied
by the Cardassians.

35
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:30,611
What?

36
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:32,340
l... borrowed the proof.

37
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,144
lt's got a gul's thumb scan
on it.

38
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,116
The Circle hates
the Cardassians.

39
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,381
They don't know
it is the Cardassians.

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,412
They think they've been buying
from Kressari traders.

41
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:45,721
Think of the prestige of having
the new leader of Bajor

42
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,557
being a member of your order.

43
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:52,191
lf you are the new leader.

44
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,463
Commander, two assault
vessels are headed this way

45
00:01:54,502 --> 00:01:56,470
on direct course from Bajor.

46
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:59,371
They've given all non-Bajorans
seven hours to evacuate.

47
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:02,103
And now, the conclusion.

48
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:06,812
Starfleet feels it has
no other choice.

49
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:09,338
The Federation is here
at the invitation

50
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:11,874
of the Bajoran
provisional government.

51
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,911
No more provisional government,
no more invitation.

52
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:18,152
Governments can break off
relations with an edict.

53
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:22,161
lt's not so easy when it
comes down to our level, hmm?

54
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:23,493
Lieutenant Bilecki here

55
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:27,092
is engaged to a young
man from Bajor.

56
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:28,863
Ensign Kelly.

57
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:30,165
Ensign Kelly's daughter

58
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,864
worked together
with a young Bajoran girl

59
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:34,704
on a prize-winning
science fair project.

60
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:37,643
All of us who have served
on the station for the past year

61
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:39,305
have made Bajoran friends.

62
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:42,144
We've come to care about
what happens to these people.

63
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:44,276
l know l do.

64
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,479
So l've decided to stay.

65
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:49,183
Just to make sure

66
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:51,191
the evacuation
is conducted properly.

67
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:52,920
You'll need someone

68
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,690
to oversee
the inventory process, sir.

69
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,494
Packing away
all my medical supplies

70
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:00,557
could take, uh, quite
a while, Commander.

71
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:04,898
Before you volunteer too quickly

72
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:07,430
understand
what you're getting into.

73
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:09,841
We'll be trying to delay
the takeover of the station

74
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:10,844
as long as possible.

75
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:12,539
Hopefully, as long as it takes

76
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,606
to expose the Cardassians'
involvement in all of this.

77
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:18,550
lt won't be easy.

78
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:21,020
The Bajoran assault forces
have been told

79
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:23,853
that the Federation
is their blood enemy.

80
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:28,794
Jaro and the Circle
would love nothing more

81
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,662
than to have my head,
and yours

82
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,668
and present them
to the Chamber of Ministers.

83
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:38,661
This is your last chance
to leave here in one piece.

84
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:42,142
Some of you have families.

85
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:44,644
Some are
on temporary assignment.

86
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:45,940
l wouldn't blame anyone

87
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,811
for getting out now
while you can.

88
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:50,544
l mean that.

89
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:55,215
Anyone who wants to evacuate
is dismissed.

90
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:06,391
Non-Bajorans won't be safe here.

91
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:09,493
Our families, children
have to be evacuated.

92
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:12,005
l'm sure many of the Bajorans
who have worked with us

93
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,472
will want to leave, too.

94
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:16,943
There is a lot to get done.

95
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:20,674
The assault vessels will be here
in less than five hours.

96
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:22,773
Dismissed.

97
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:50,030
Hundreds of people to evacuate

98
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:52,734
and only three tiny runabouts
available.

99
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:55,539
Do you know what that means?

100
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:57,978
lt... it means...

101
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:01,916
Well, a lot of people
will be left behind.

102
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:03,919
Tragic. Yes, brother.

103
00:07:03,953 --> 00:07:06,581
Your compassion
never ceases to amaze me.

104
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:09,250
lt means we're going
to make a fortune.

105
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,952
We are?

106
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:15,054
People will pay anything
for a seat on those ships.

107
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:16,256
You can't make me...

108
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:19,062
Well, l won't sell my seat.

109
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:20,159
Rom.

110
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:24,161
No! l won't stay and be killed
just to fill your pockets.

111
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:26,299
Rom, do you actually believe

112
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:30,142
that l would sacrifice
my own brother's life...

113
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:34,540
for personal profit?

114
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:43,249
lt would have to be
the deal of a lifetime.

115
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:44,554
Yes, my lifetime.

116
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:46,026
Listen to me.

117
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:48,087
We're both going to escape...

118
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,360
but our bags will be filled

119
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,926
with all the gold-pressed
latinum we can carry.

120
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:01,910
Nog!

121
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:03,878
l've been looking
all over for you.

122
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:05,039
What ship you on?

123
00:08:05,114 --> 00:08:06,046
<i>Rio Grande.</i>

124
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:07,445
l'm on the <i>Ganges.</i>

125
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:08,882
Oh. Well, it'll be okay.

126
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:11,409
We'll see each other
at the Hanolan colony

127
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:12,648
in a few days.

128
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:14,053
That's not where l'm going.

129
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:15,953
But my dad told me...

130
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:18,619
My ship's going
to the Korat system.

131
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:20,720
l guess that's
where they're taking

132
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:22,424
all the Starfleet families.

133
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:24,899
Well, this will be
over in no time.

134
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:27,494
We'll be back in school
driving Mrs. O'Brien crazy

135
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:28,730
in a few days.

136
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:31,171
Just when l think
l've found a new home

137
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:32,196
and a new friend

138
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:34,175
it always seems
like l got to leave.

139
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,644
Hey, hu-man...

140
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,078
Cut it out!

141
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,740
Has there ever been
one of your kind

142
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:43,718
and one of my kind
who were better friends?

143
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:45,617
Never.

144
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:49,420
And if our fathers
couldn't break us up

145
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,426
no stupid coupe day... coupe...

146
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,950
Coup d'état.

147
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:54,292
lt's French.

148
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,231
Well, no stupid French thing
will, either.

149
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:59,860
We'll see each other again soon.

150
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:01,369
That's a promise.

151
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:02,665
Mr. Sisko, Nog

152
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:04,900
this is no time
to be fooling about.

153
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,932
Get yourselves to wherever
you're supposed to be.

154
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:21,919
ls that everything?

155
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:23,584
Sure.

156
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:26,151
Oh, Keiko, please.
Don't go like this.

157
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:27,287
Like what?

158
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:28,990
l don't have any choice.

159
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:30,157
Don't you?

160
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:31,257
He needs me.

161
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,528
We don't?

162
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:35,230
We can't just let the Cardies
have the wormhole.

163
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:37,068
They could have
the whole Gamma Quadrant

164
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:38,128
for all l care.

165
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:43,575
Miles...

166
00:09:46,282 --> 00:09:48,079
come with us.

167
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,209
Where are we going?

168
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:51,947
On a ride, sweetheart.

169
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:53,978
Are you coming, too, Daddy?

170
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:56,548
Soon, baby.

171
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:59,220
l'll come as soon as l can.

172
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:08,569
l'll walk you to the airlock.

173
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:19,079
l've scanned every subspace
communication window

174
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:20,706
to find a frequency to Bajor.

175
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:22,444
They've got them
completely jammed.

176
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:24,679
Then we have no choice.

177
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,245
We'll have to take the proof
to the Chamber of Ministers.

178
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:30,690
Jaro's forces will be scanning
for any incoming vessels.

179
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:32,785
A runabout could handle
a Bajoran patrol.

180
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:35,058
Unfortunately,
l don't have one to give you.

181
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:37,224
The Lunar V base?

182
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,733
You think there's still
a ship there?

183
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:39,734
We managed to get

184
00:10:39,768 --> 00:10:41,827
a few subimpulse raiders
underground

185
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,668
before the Cardassians hit us,
but that was ten years ago.

186
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:46,265
Could one
of the evacuation vessels

187
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:48,333
take a detour and drop me off?

188
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:50,436
What if you get there
and those raiders won't fly?

189
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:53,141
Then l'll have to wait
until l hear from you, l guess.

190
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:55,980
You may have to wait
a long time.

191
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:58,851
Dax...

192
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:02,152
do any of your former
hosts have experience

193
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,785
with subimpulse
thruster configurations?

194
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:06,317
Yes. Tobin Dax.

195
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:09,092
Tobin? l don't think
l've heard about this one.

196
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:10,392
My second host.

197
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:12,696
Barely a sex life,
and no imagination

198
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:15,932
but he knew phase coil inverters
like no one else.

199
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:19,099
Major Kira could use
his experience today.

200
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:20,471
l have no time
for this foolishness.

201
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:21,476
l still have to pack.

202
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,738
What's the problem?

203
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:25,440
He's been brokering seats
on the evacuation vessels.

204
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:28,109
Where did you get more seats?

205
00:11:28,217 --> 00:11:30,117
Everybody always
asks the brokers

206
00:11:30,185 --> 00:11:32,551
where they get
their extra seats.

207
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:34,249
And all l can say
is it's my business

208
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,451
to find preferred seating
for a select list of clients...

209
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:38,255
l have got more than 200 people

210
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,125
who want to get
off this station.

211
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:41,924
Where did you get more seats?!

212
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:42,988
A few trades.

213
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:44,829
A person here or there

214
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:47,267
who changed his mind
about leaving

215
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:49,328
at the sight
of a reasonable stipend.

216
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:51,100
Bashir to Commander Sisko.

217
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,368
Go ahead.

218
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:54,774
We're having a bit of a panic
at the airlock, sir.

219
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,278
Far more passengers
than we can handle have shown up

220
00:11:57,313 --> 00:12:00,942
and they all claim to have made
arrangements to leave.

221
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:03,679
l might have overbooked,
slightly.

222
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:07,615
On my way.

223
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:11,717
lt's an accepted
Ferengi transit practice.

224
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,354
l feel perfectly justified.

225
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:16,421
l have complete faith

226
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:18,797
in Commander Sisko's ability
to straighten this out.

227
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,096
l'll pass that on.

228
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:23,228
He'll be so pleased to know
that he has your confidence.

229
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:24,796
As l'm no longer needed

230
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,536
my brother is waiting for me
on the ship.

231
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:32,241
Hey, Odo.

232
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:35,047
You'll miss me.

233
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:36,312
You know you will.
Say it.

234
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:38,650
l'll miss you, Quark.

235
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:40,052
You said it!

236
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:41,420
l'll miss the aggravation

237
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:43,322
the petty theft,
the bad manners...

238
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:46,795
Odo... take care of yourself.

239
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,534
Don't you understand?!

240
00:12:58,574 --> 00:13:00,474
There isn't room for everyone.

241
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:03,171
We have to get our families,
our children

242
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:04,975
and non-Bajorans...

243
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:08,976
Where are you running to?!

244
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,812
This is Bajor.

245
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,082
We are Bajorans.

246
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:20,718
We fought a war
to regain our homeland.

247
00:13:20,763 --> 00:13:25,693
How can you abandon it
like frightened Cardassian vole?

248
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:29,159
These ships are for our guests
who must leave

249
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:32,256
because it is no longer safe
for them here.

250
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:37,362
However, we are Bajorans...

251
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:42,432
and l say that we stay
and we solve our own problems.

252
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:44,171
Together.

253
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:47,737
Are you willing to join me?

254
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:57,591
As soon as the passenger lists
are confirmed

255
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,853
get these ships out of here.

256
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:00,189
They're almost ready to go, sir.

257
00:14:00,227 --> 00:14:02,092
The <i>Rio Grande</i> is full
and so is the <i>Orinoco.</i>

258
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:03,027
Get them launched.

259
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,119
Aye, sir.

260
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:09,899
Are you ready?

261
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:11,427
l've been thinking.

262
00:14:11,472 --> 00:14:13,406
l really think
it'd be better if l stayed.

263
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:17,406
Look, l just don't want
anything to happen to you.

264
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:19,241
That makes two of us.

265
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:21,507
What's this?

266
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:22,947
A letter l wrote you.

267
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:24,143
A letter?

268
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:25,549
Just some things.

269
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:28,054
l'll read it as soon
as l get on the ship.

270
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:29,384
Wait a while.

271
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:34,317
l'll see you in
a couple of weeks.

272
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:40,065
That's everyone, sir.

273
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,067
Sisko to <i>Ganges.</i>

274
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:43,932
Proceed with launch.

275
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:45,063
Acknowledged.

276
00:14:45,105 --> 00:14:47,266
Good luck, Commander.
Kira out.

277
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:48,535
No! No!

278
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,667
Wait!

279
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:54,037
My ship...the <i>Rio Grande...</i>

280
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:56,447
my brother's on it.

281
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:58,075
He's got my ticket.

282
00:14:58,152 --> 00:14:59,210
That ship was full, sir.

283
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:00,447
l checked the list myself.

284
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:01,681
Quark's name wasn't on it.

285
00:15:01,722 --> 00:15:03,019
His brother Rom did go aboard

286
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,387
but he was with a dabo girl.

287
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,017
A dabo girl?

288
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:07,684
What?

289
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:10,561
Looks like he sold your seat.

290
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:16,261
No...

291
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:17,770
No, you don't understand.

292
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:21,138
You don't understand!

293
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:23,166
l can't stay here!

294
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:27,304
l'll be hung.

295
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:30,441
Call the ships back!

296
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,452
l'll pay anyone

297
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:36,616
five bars of gold-pressed
latinum for a seat!

298
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,956
Ten bars.

299
00:15:42,196 --> 00:15:43,663
Twenty.

300
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:08,350
Clear.

301
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:09,946
No resistance at all.

302
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,857
Minister Jaro's prediction
was correct.

303
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:15,361
The Federation
has tucked its tail

304
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:16,726
between its legs.

305
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:30,234
Where are the Bajoran officers
who worked with Starfleet?

306
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:32,939
Where is Li Nalas?

307
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,572
Perhaps they knew
this old station

308
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:36,048
could never withstand a siege

309
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,244
and they abandoned it
with Starfleet.

310
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:43,348
The most strategic position
in the entire sector--

311
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,985
at the mouth of the wormhole.

312
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:49,154
Hmm.

313
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,596
Had l been Federation Commander

314
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:54,692
l would not have abandoned it
so easily.

315
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:16,011
Can you believe, a year ago, l
was living in a camp like this?

316
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:18,456
Only not quite so nice.

317
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:21,757
Have l mentioned how allergic
Trills are to insect bites?

318
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:23,160
Really?

319
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:25,222
Well, the biochemical
connections

320
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:28,496
between host and symbiont
can't tolerate the... oh!

321
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:29,502
Whoa! What's that?

322
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:30,662
ls that a spider or a dog?

323
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:32,399
<i>Palukoo.</i>

324
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:34,737
The Bajoran moons
are full of them.

325
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:37,767
Oh, l suppose you used
to make them your pets

326
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:40,473
and, uh, sing songs about them
around the campfire.

327
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:42,482
No. We used to eat them.

328
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:43,847
There it is.

329
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:50,890
Are you sure this thing
is supposed to fly?

330
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:52,789
Oh, l've been in a lot worse.

331
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:01,063
l guess the Bajoran resistance

332
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:02,829
must have had
a lot of short pilots.

333
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,497
Ha, no, just short engineers.

334
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:07,371
They were always
building these things

335
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:08,499
without thinking.

336
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:09,566
Encouraging.

337
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,407
Just bend your knees.
You'll fit.

338
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:20,486
Now, the real trick will be
to fire up these thrusters

339
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,487
after all this time.

340
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:23,011
lt was hard enough
to get them going

341
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:24,546
when they were being used
every day.

342
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:25,990
We'll get them fired up.

343
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:28,017
You don't have
to worry about that.

344
00:18:28,061 --> 00:18:30,359
Oh, you're sure, huh?

345
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:32,024
Yep.

346
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:35,398
l have no intention
of getting stuck here

347
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:37,300
eating <i>palukoos.</i>

348
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:49,841
We should inform Minister Jaro
of our success immediately.

349
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,443
You're too eager to receive
his plaudits, Colonel.

350
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:54,352
What's the status
of the internal security net?

351
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:55,250
What's the status
of the internal security net?

352
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:57,516
Completely disabled, General.

353
00:18:57,555 --> 00:18:59,716
Scan the Operations Center
for organic material.

354
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:01,156
Organic?

355
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:04,525
The station's Security Chief
is apparently missing.

356
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:08,961
The shape-shifter.

357
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,834
lt's possible he left
with the evacuation ships

358
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,566
or perhaps there's
something more here

359
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:17,335
than meets the eye.

360
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,206
Yes, sir.

361
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:23,202
Scan six times an hour
at random intervals.

362
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,909
Minister Jaro on subspace, sir.

363
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,349
Minister, l'm pleased
to inform you

364
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:29,853
that we've encountered
no resistance so far.

365
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:32,412
Good news. Then
the Federation has withdrawn.

366
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:33,753
We monitored the evacuation

367
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,850
of three vessels
several hours ago.

368
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:38,327
When l announce that we've
secured the station

369
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:39,556
it will certainly impact...

370
00:19:39,597 --> 00:19:41,588
Minister, l urge caution.

371
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:45,591
The battle for this station
hasn't even begun yet.

372
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:47,968
Do you expect the enemy
to return, General?

373
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,973
l'm not convinced
they ever left.

374
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:52,601
The internal security net
has been sabotaged.

375
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:57,546
We have no way of tracking the
movements of anyone on board

376
00:19:57,581 --> 00:20:00,049
which suggests
someone didn't want

377
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:01,881
to be that easily found.

378
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,910
Kira?

379
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,422
Perhaps.
She is unaccounted for.

380
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:08,891
So, too, is Security Chief Odo.

381
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:10,393
So is Li Nalas.

382
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:11,395
You're right.

383
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:14,227
Li Nalas would have never
abandoned Bajor.

384
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:15,698
He must still be there.

385
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:18,327
Let me reemphasize that you are
to take every necessary step

386
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:19,893
to keep Li Nalas alive.

387
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:20,961
Dead, he's a martyr.

388
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:22,700
Alive, he seals our victory.

389
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,004
Understood.

390
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,169
Once you have him

391
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,305
Li will see the wisdom
of giving you his support.

392
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:32,816
l'll offer him anything he wants
to make sure he does--

393
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,512
short of becoming
the next Kai, of course.

394
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:44,684
You have a unique ability
to build a consensus, Essa.

395
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:48,096
Bajor has been waiting
for a leader like you.

396
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:50,064
Leaders like us.

397
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:56,005
lf l am so favored
by the Vedek Assembly.

398
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,804
You don't have
to worry about that.

399
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:05,811
26 hours after l'm
sworn into office

400
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,480
l'll direct the Vedek Assembly
to elect you Kai.

401
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,921
Together, we will rebuild Bajor.

402
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:25,000
You got it!

403
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,997
Don't turn the engines off.

404
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:30,063
We'll never get them
started again.

405
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:31,835
Let's go.

406
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:34,242
Thank you, Tobin.

407
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:35,768
Dax, come on.

408
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:37,848
Oh, the hell with it.

409
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:39,315
lf it's going to fly,
it's going to fly.

410
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,749
Problem?

411
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:42,309
No, everything's wonderful.

412
00:21:42,353 --> 00:21:43,911
Ow!

413
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:45,319
The knees.

414
00:21:45,356 --> 00:21:47,324
Oh, listen to that sound.

415
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:50,191
That sure brings back
some memories.

416
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,491
How did you win a war
in these things?

417
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,054
We were the insects, Lieutenant.

418
00:21:54,098 --> 00:21:55,725
The Cardassians were
just as allergic as Trills.

419
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:56,892
ls the proximity system working?

420
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,563
l think so.

421
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,595
All right, let's see
if we can get out of here

422
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,073
without bouncing off any walls.

423
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,437
You're playing
right into their hands.

424
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:11,539
lf you're so convinced
they're still here

425
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:14,949
how can you sit
and wait for them to attack?

426
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,852
They have no interest
in attacking.

427
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,947
What makes you so sure?

428
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,391
Because l understand
military tactics.

429
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:26,624
They are vastly outnumbered.

430
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:28,655
lf we divide our forces...

431
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:32,632
The primary sensor array
was sabotaged, sir.

432
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:36,401
As soon as we tested it,
the sub-net shorted out.

433
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:41,407
You can let your engineers
play with the machines.

434
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:44,437
l'm sending out search parties.

435
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,411
Eat hearty.

436
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,647
The replicators crash
in 16 minutes.

437
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:53,248
This will have to last a while.

438
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,348
Combat rations, Chief?

439
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:56,791
Couldn't you have
replicated something

440
00:22:56,827 --> 00:22:58,260
a little more palatable?

441
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,853
You don't like combat rations?

442
00:22:59,897 --> 00:23:02,866
A French onion soup
would have really been nice.

443
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,391
Miracle of science,
these little combat rations.

444
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:07,996
Timed-release formula
of all the nutrients

445
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,302
the body needs for three days.

446
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:11,603
l love them.

447
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,735
The only thing l miss
about the Cardassian front.

448
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:16,271
Sisko to all units.

449
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:20,044
You can thank Chief
of Operations Miles O'Brien

450
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,209
for your repast this afternoon.

451
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:24,687
Oh, you haven't made
any friends here, Chief.

452
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:26,485
Or should l say chef?

453
00:23:26,524 --> 00:23:28,151
Julian!

454
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:30,854
Well, l would have expected you
of all people

455
00:23:30,895 --> 00:23:33,796
to appreciate the nutritional
value of combat rations.

456
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,264
Actually, when l was
in med school

457
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:36,732
l designed
an incredible candy bar

458
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:39,065
which was far superior
in food value.

459
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:42,231
Am l the only one that doesn't
think this is funny?

460
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:43,570
Odo to Sisko.

461
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:44,904
Go ahead.

462
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:46,307
Standby.
There's a patrol approaching.

463
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,140
l'll get back to you
in a minute.

464
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:02,921
A five-man unit

465
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,724
is about to begin
a search of the cargo deck.

466
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:07,594
That puts them closest to me,
Commander.

467
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:08,723
Stand by, Doctor.

468
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:12,497
Maybe we should send someone
with a little more experience.

469
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:15,130
Someone who can run the show,
like Li.

470
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:17,868
No, l need him here with us.

471
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:22,777
Doctor, move your unit
to Cargo Bay 6.

472
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:24,212
You know what to do.

473
00:24:24,248 --> 00:24:26,045
And let me reemphasize--

474
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,136
use deadly force
only if absolutely necessary.

475
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,429
Aye, sir.

476
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,562
We're on our way.

477
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:32,936
Happy hunting.

478
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,950
l wouldn't get
too close to that.

479
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,893
lt's thorium isotope.

480
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:03,365
Prolonged exposure could have
very nasty consequences.

481
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:08,702
Bashir to Sisko.

482
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:09,868
Go ahead.

483
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,343
Mission accomplished.

484
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:15,178
We have our first five
prisoners of war.

485
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,084
Preparing to establish
a high-altitude orbit of Bajor.

486
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:30,619
Navigational sensors
aren't functioning.

487
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:31,631
No problem.

488
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:32,654
No problem?

489
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:33,666
Big problem.

490
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,997
Without navigational sensors...

491
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,003
We'll have to fly
by the seat of our pants.

492
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,767
Great.
Seat-of-the-pants technology.

493
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:42,866
You Starfleet types are too
dependent on gadgets and gizmos.

494
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:45,742
You lose your natural instincts
for survival.

495
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,576
My natural instincts
for survival told me

496
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:48,945
not to climb aboard this thing.

497
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:50,847
l'd say they were
functioning pretty well.

498
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:52,442
l know the terrain of Bajor.

499
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:55,421
We ought to be able to
recognize a landing site...

500
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:57,545
What the hell was that?

501
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:58,558
l have no idea.

502
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:00,492
None of the sensors
are functioning.

503
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:03,496
Someone's firing at us.

504
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,464
lnitiating evasive maneuvers.

505
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:08,161
l'm reading the EM signature
of an impulse engine.

506
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:10,465
Let's see
what we're dealing with.

507
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,979
Welcoming committee from Jaro.

508
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,207
We'll never outrun them in this.

509
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,216
You're right.

510
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,547
We'll have to even the match.

511
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,074
And how do you intend
to do that?

512
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,416
New playing field.

513
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:29,217
l'm taking us down
into the atmosphere.

514
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,986
They won't be able to use their
impulse engines down there.

515
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,923
lf they want a fight

516
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,224
they'll have to fight
on our terms.

517
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:03,981
Come on.

518
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:06,288
Get down.

519
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:19,630
O'Brien to Sisko.

520
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:20,901
Go ahead.

521
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,636
They've got us
pinned down in here.

522
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:25,406
On our way, Chief.

523
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:15,055
Now.

524
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,121
All right,
they've gone to thrusters.

525
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,498
That evens things up a little.

526
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:58,561
lf you consider
two against one even.

527
00:28:58,605 --> 00:28:59,663
There is one problem.

528
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:00,764
One?

529
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,274
The guys flying those ships?

530
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,401
Yeah?

531
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:05,411
Used to be the guys
flying these ships.

532
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:07,941
Test the phaser banks.

533
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:09,379
-Full power.
-Good.

534
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,383
Uh, not so good.

535
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:11,441
Phaser locks are dead.

536
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:12,542
There's no way to aim.

537
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,552
Sure, there is!

538
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,883
l know. l know.

539
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,548
Seat of the pants.

540
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,216
With your eyes, Lieutenant,
not your pants.

541
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:19,350
Just point at them and fire!

542
00:29:19,392 --> 00:29:21,758
You fly, l'll shoot.

543
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,092
Hang on.

544
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:51,518
Where the hell's the other one?

545
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:55,517
l think we found him.

546
00:29:55,562 --> 00:29:56,654
Thruster power's falling.

547
00:29:56,696 --> 00:29:58,323
They must have hit
a plasma conduit.

548
00:29:58,365 --> 00:29:59,332
Got any fire gear?

549
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:00,924
Check under the seat.

550
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,332
l think l got something.

551
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:03,529
Got it.

552
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:09,868
That's it?

553
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,501
That's it.

554
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:13,569
Might as well jettison
the plasma tank.

555
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:14,807
Thrusters are gone.

556
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,509
Plasma tank ejected.

557
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:19,643
Can you see any openings
where we can put down?

558
00:30:19,686 --> 00:30:21,654
Six kilometers ahead at 2:00.

559
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:22,882
Uh, anything a little closer?

560
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:23,889
How much closer?

561
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:26,414
How about right here?

562
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,007
Sir, up here.

563
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,709
One of the Ferengi's
holosuites is in use.

564
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:03,084
Don't try it.

565
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,459
Get their weapons.

566
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,206
This is
Commander Benjamin Sisko.

567
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,077
Please listen very carefully.

568
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:26,573
The Cardassians are supplying
the weapons for this coup.

569
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:27,847
Ridiculous.

570
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,480
No Bajoran would ever
accept help from them.

571
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:31,989
Jaro doesn't know.

572
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,616
The Cardassians are using
the Kressari

573
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,890
to deliver the weapons
to the Circle.

574
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,521
That is a Federation lie!

575
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:41,829
The proof is on its way
to Bajor.

576
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:45,166
Once this evidence is presented,
the coup will end.

577
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:48,833
We don't want to fight you
or hurt anyone.

578
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:52,469
Your officers will be our guests
for a while.

579
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:56,311
l hope they won't mind
Starfleet combat rations.

580
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,778
Day, what the hell
is going on?

581
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,950
l was taken prisoner.

582
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,460
The Federation
is behind all this.

583
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:10,655
Sisko spoke to me.

584
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,093
So, Commander

585
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:17,728
you didn't abandon your post,
after all.

586
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,931
What did he say?

587
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:22,236
Nothing of consequence.

588
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,674
Why did he let you go?

589
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,144
l promised them amnesty--

590
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,739
a promise l have
no intention of keeping.

591
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,613
General, the security net
is back on line.

592
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,244
Scan for their
communication devices.

593
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,914
Not picking up a thing, sir.

594
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,650
Then they must be
in a shielded location.

595
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:39,988
The Cardassians used

596
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:42,652
duranium composite
to shield all the conduits.

597
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:45,755
Then that's where we'll
find Commander Sisko.

598
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,409
They found the raider,
and they're spreading out.

599
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:01,413
We can't stay here.

600
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:02,812
l'll slow you down.

601
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,839
The only thing
that's important now

602
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:07,943
is to get the evidence
to the provisional government.

603
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,782
lt would be
a lot more convincing

604
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:10,948
if it comes from you.

605
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,958
No, the evidence
speaks for itself.

606
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,323
You have to leave me.

607
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,522
That's an order, Lieutenant.

608
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:21,658
The Federation officially
left Bajor yesterday.

609
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,190
You're no longer
my commanding officer.

610
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,497
l can't walk.

611
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:25,798
Yes, you can.

612
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,772
You are being a fool, Dax.

613
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,433
Don't talk to your elders
that way.

614
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:30,965
You two, check over there.

615
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,074
They couldn't have gotten far.

616
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,358
Odo to Sisko.

617
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,229
l hope you're not
still on level five.

618
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:56,825
No, we're on three.
Why?

619
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,860
Because they're about to fill
the conduits

620
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:01,498
with anesthizine gas,
starting with level five.

621
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,030
Chief?

622
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,599
Well, it's a good idea.

623
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:07,476
Kind of thing
l might have come up with.

624
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:10,710
We better get out of here,
and soon.

625
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:14,082
We should have heard something
from Kira and Dax by now.

626
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,711
Well, if they didn't make it

627
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:18,655
we're all fighting
for a lost cause here.

628
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,056
We still have
an ace in the hole.

629
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,359
Me?

630
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,456
Mr. O'Brien, get the units
ready to move out.

631
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:28,830
Aye, sir.

632
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,926
Jaro's plan depends
on the military's support.

633
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,098
Without it, the coup fails.

634
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,472
And you think
l can sway the generals.

635
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,238
Right now,
there's only one general

636
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,405
l'm concerned with--
the one that's here.

637
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,845
He's picked the wrong side

638
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,906
and we've got to convince him
of that.

639
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:50,149
Would you rather
follow a politician

640
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,783
or Bajor's greatest war hero?

641
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:55,555
l've done everything
l can to help.

642
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,926
l'd die for my people, but...

643
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:59,225
Sure, you would.

644
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,732
Dying gets you off the hook.

645
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:02,859
The question is

646
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,927
are you willing to live
for your people--

647
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,098
live the role
they want you to play?

648
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,665
That's what they need
from you right now.

649
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,219
Kira?

650
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,553
Kira, you're safe.

651
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,957
You're at the monastery.

652
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:32,895
l... the last thing
l remember...

653
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,126
The entire city
saw your ship go down.

654
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:38,398
The searchers who found you
are from my order.

655
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:39,495
Dax?

656
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:40,971
She's fine.

657
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:42,335
She's changing clothes.

658
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:45,468
We've got to get
to the Chamber of Ministers.

659
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,977
The Cardassians...

660
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,980
l know.
Lieutenant Dax told me.

661
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,174
Oh!

662
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:51,807
Careful.

663
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,980
Careful. You've just had
a broken hip mended.

664
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:58,512
How long have l been here?

665
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:01,754
-Six hours.
-Six hours.

666
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,091
We have to get out of here.

667
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,426
The Chamber of Minis...

668
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:06,522
Good, you're up.

669
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:07,657
Here, put this on.

670
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:08,757
Why are we...?

671
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,098
lt's the only way we can get
into the Chamber of Ministers.

672
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,696
Members of religious orders
are the only ones

673
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,866
who can travel safely
in the streets.

674
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,933
l'm going to escort you.

675
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,638
No. No, we have to go
alone, Bareil.

676
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,874
l can't be responsible
for your safety.

677
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,143
Of course, you can't

678
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,446
but l can be
responsible for yours.

679
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:27,713
No...

680
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:30,244
Please, don't argue.

681
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:35,153
So, what do you think?

682
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,455
Think?

683
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:37,826
The nose.

684
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,831
Oh... it's flattering.

685
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,333
l'm thinking of keeping it.

686
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,764
Quark, leave it.

687
00:36:44,897 --> 00:36:46,262
l can't leave it.

688
00:36:46,298 --> 00:36:47,925
lt's all that l am.

689
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:50,026
My personal mementos...

690
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:51,696
my family album...

691
00:36:51,737 --> 00:36:54,297
lt's full of gold-pressed
latinum and you know it.

692
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,740
Who told you?

693
00:36:56,776 --> 00:36:58,971
Your mother did
the day you were born.

694
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:06,883
Never make fun
of a Ferengi's mother!

695
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:09,046
Rule of Acquisition, Number 31.

696
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:11,056
Sisko to Bashir.
We're in position.

697
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,024
We're stationed
above Airlock 14, sir

698
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:14,026
awaiting your signal.

699
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,027
You've got it.

700
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:16,187
Just make as much noise
as you can

701
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:18,196
before you surrender, Doctor.

702
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,562
We'll make them think
there are 200 of us

703
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,896
instead of 20, sir.

704
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:23,060
Bashir out.

705
00:37:23,102 --> 00:37:24,262
Twenty-one.

706
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:27,129
Come on.

707
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:28,970
Now!

708
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,711
Fine! Fine.

709
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:35,737
l'm coming.

710
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:51,253
Proceed with level three.

711
00:37:51,297 --> 00:37:52,764
General, the enemy

712
00:37:52,798 --> 00:37:55,596
has attacked our position
at Airlock 14.

713
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:57,295
They have attacked?

714
00:37:57,336 --> 00:37:59,531
We must have flushed them out.

715
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:00,698
Seal all airlocks.

716
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,605
Lock all docking clamps.

717
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:03,869
This is Colonel Day.

718
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:06,343
All security units
to Airlock 14.

719
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:08,778
Let me see
what's going on down there.

720
00:38:08,814 --> 00:38:10,406
Surveillance cameras
have been sabotaged.

721
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:13,714
How many of our men are
stationed by that airlock?

722
00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:14,777
Four, sir.

723
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,980
Security to General Krim.

724
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:19,513
The enemy forces at Airlock 14
have surrendered.

725
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:21,788
We've taken several prisoners.

726
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:24,387
Bring their leaders to me
for questioning.

727
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,030
Aye, sir.

728
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,587
Aye, sir.

729
00:38:40,212 --> 00:38:42,203
Please don't resist, General.

730
00:38:42,248 --> 00:38:44,614
We don't wish
to use deadly force.

731
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,259
My name is Li Nalas.

732
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,387
Perhaps you've heard of me.

733
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,266
Guards, stop that woman.

734
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:08,864
What is this blasphemy?

735
00:39:08,908 --> 00:39:11,843
l am Major Kira Nerys,
and l come with proof

736
00:39:11,877 --> 00:39:15,074
that the Cardassians
are behind Minister Jaro's

737
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:16,843
attempt to take control
of the government.

738
00:39:16,882 --> 00:39:20,147
Major Kira has long been
an outspoken opponent

739
00:39:20,186 --> 00:39:22,450
of the provisional government--

740
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:25,889
of reason, of progress,
and now, finally, of me.

741
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:28,358
l'm honored
to be included, Major.

742
00:39:28,394 --> 00:39:31,522
But l have no intention
of allowing you to disrupt

743
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:34,727
the orderly transition of power
with these wild charges.

744
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:39,704
This is a manifest padd
from a Kressari vessel.

745
00:39:39,738 --> 00:39:43,401
lt bears the thumb scan
of a Cardassian gul

746
00:39:43,442 --> 00:39:46,900
who transferred weapons
to that ship.

747
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:51,349
Those weapons were taken
by the Kressari to the Circle.

748
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:54,512
This coup will deliver Bajor

749
00:39:54,553 --> 00:39:57,147
back into the hands
of its greatest enemies.

750
00:39:57,189 --> 00:40:00,920
Are you willing to live
under Cardassian rule again?

751
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,428
l assure you there's nothing
to these accusations.

752
00:40:03,462 --> 00:40:06,625
Then you should have
no objection

753
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:09,429
to an inspection
of this manifest, Minister.

754
00:40:11,871 --> 00:40:13,668
No, of course not.

755
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:16,106
We'll adjourn
for the time being.

756
00:40:20,813 --> 00:40:24,214
And let me say that l completely
support this investigation

757
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,047
and fully intend to cooperate.

758
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:52,871
Colonel, you deliberately
withheld information

759
00:40:52,912 --> 00:40:55,745
that was to be
communicated to me.

760
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:57,749
lnformation?

761
00:40:57,783 --> 00:41:00,115
Regarding the Cardassians.

762
00:41:00,152 --> 00:41:04,213
Lies, that's all they were.

763
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,746
We have been told

764
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:09,352
the Chamber is in recess,
while evidence

765
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:12,057
of Cardassian involvement
is being examined.

766
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:14,065
The Circle is broken, Colonel.

767
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:18,263
l'm returning
to the surface immediately

768
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:21,432
to consult with the Ministers.

769
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:25,307
l expect l will
be asked to resign.

770
00:41:28,714 --> 00:41:32,673
Commander, since the provisional
government has prevailed

771
00:41:32,718 --> 00:41:34,811
l believe it is appropriate

772
00:41:34,853 --> 00:41:39,085
to return the command
of this station to Starfleet.

773
00:41:41,427 --> 00:41:43,054
Well-fought, sir.

774
00:41:49,435 --> 00:41:50,834
No.

775
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,532
Commander!

776
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:17,359
Off the hook... after all.

777
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,283
Somehow, you figured,
now that he was here

778
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:47,258
things would be better.

779
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:49,089
You know, he'd...

780
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:53,491
he'd find a way
to make things better

781
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:56,968
because he was a man
who could do that.

782
00:42:57,069 --> 00:43:00,505
A great man.

783
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:02,905
l wish l knew

784
00:43:02,975 --> 00:43:05,808
where we could find
others like him.

785
00:43:05,844 --> 00:43:08,574
Major, there are heroes
all over Bajor.

786
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:12,747
l'm sitting with one.

787
00:43:12,785 --> 00:43:14,412
l'm sorry.

788
00:43:14,453 --> 00:43:17,650
l... don't feel
like celebrating tonight.

789
00:43:17,689 --> 00:43:19,281
Excuse me.

790
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:28,295
Sir, can l ask you something?

791
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:29,732
Sure.

792
00:43:29,768 --> 00:43:30,928
About Li Nalas.

793
00:43:31,003 --> 00:43:32,129
Mm-hmm.

794
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:34,731
Well, listening to Kira
talk about all he was

795
00:43:34,773 --> 00:43:36,934
all he did,
all he was going to do

796
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:40,273
she makes him sound like
he was larger than life

797
00:43:40,312 --> 00:43:43,042
like he was some kind
of military genius

798
00:43:43,082 --> 00:43:45,516
but the Li Nalas
l fought with...

799
00:43:45,551 --> 00:43:49,954
Chief, Li Nalas was the hero
of the Bajoran resistance.

800
00:43:49,988 --> 00:43:52,957
He performed extraordinary
acts of courage for his people

801
00:43:52,991 --> 00:43:54,618
and died for their freedom.

802
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,152
That's how the history books
on Bajor will be written

803
00:43:58,197 --> 00:44:01,826
and that's how l'll remember him
when anybody asks.

804
00:44:01,867 --> 00:44:04,028
Yes, sir.

805
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:05,900
Dax to Sisko.

806
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:08,907
The <i>Ganges</i> has just docked
at Pad C, Benjamin.

807
00:44:08,974 --> 00:44:10,202
Acknowledged.

808
00:44:10,242 --> 00:44:11,971
Excuse me, sir.

809
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:24,683
Dad.
