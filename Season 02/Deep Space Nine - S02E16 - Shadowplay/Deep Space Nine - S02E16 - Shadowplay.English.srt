1
00:00:02,728 --> 00:00:07,688
Science Officer's Log,
Stardate 47 603.3.

2
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:09,166
Commander Sisko has assigned me

3
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:11,134
to investigate an unusual
particle field

4
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,262
detected on the other side
of the wormhole.

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,796
Odo has come along
to the Gamma Quadrant

6
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,071
hoping to find clues
to his origin.

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,578
So you see, Ensign Manwaring
has spent the last two weeks

8
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:22,512
avoiding the Assay Office
because he thought

9
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:24,481
that Freyla was in love
with Lieutenant Strek

10
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:27,110
but all the while, Strek was
seeing Security Officer Seelee.

11
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,416
And Freyla was waiting for
Manwaring to ask her out.

12
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:32,617
Officer Seelee has seemed
distracted at work lately.

13
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,354
l'm going to have to talk
to her about this

14
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:37,362
when we get back to the station.

15
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:39,762
Odo, l didn't tell you
that story

16
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:41,459
to get Seelee in trouble.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,899
Frankly, Lieutenant

18
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:46,131
l fail to see any point
in your story at all

19
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,162
except perhaps to illustrate

20
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:50,640
the foolish humanoid
preoccupation

21
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,371
with romantic coupling.

22
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:56,006
The point is that, sometimes,
we don't see true love

23
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:58,642
even when it's staring us
right in the face.

24
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:02,142
How fascinating.

25
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,586
Let me give you another example.

26
00:01:04,623 --> 00:01:06,147
You know Lysia Arlin?

27
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:09,455
The Bolian woman
who runs the <i>jumja</i> kiosk.

28
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:12,588
l've noticed she's been making
a lot of visits

29
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:14,155
to the security office lately.

30
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:15,563
She has a cousin

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,592
who's interested in a career
in law enforcement.

32
00:01:18,637 --> 00:01:20,366
You don't say.

33
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,507
Are you implying that Lysia
Arlin is interested in me?

34
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,841
Ridiculous.

35
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,679
l would have noticed.

36
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,549
Exactly my point.

37
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,855
You must be mistaken.

38
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,187
And how can you be so sure?

39
00:01:40,258 --> 00:01:44,456
Because women don't react
to me in that manner.

40
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:47,954
Are you saying that you've
never had a female friend?

41
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:50,968
l consider Major Kira a friend.

42
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:53,368
That's not what l meant.

43
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,373
l'm talking about...

44
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,671
an intimate friendship.

45
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,678
That's a very personal question.

46
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:03,647
l'm sorry, but after
seven lifetimes

47
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:06,480
the impersonal questions
aren't much fun anymore.

48
00:02:08,286 --> 00:02:11,016
Looks like we found
our particle field.

49
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:14,389
They're omicron particles.

50
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,155
ls that unusual?

51
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:18,423
Omicron particles
are incredibly rare.

52
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:19,896
They can only be created

53
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,866
by certain types of
matter/antimatter reactions.

54
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,391
The field seems to be coming

55
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,836
from the second planet
in the system.

56
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:28,601
Let's go in a little closer.

57
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:33,074
That's strange.

58
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:37,172
The particles are concentrated
in one small valley.

59
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,116
Sensors aren't picking up
any life-forms.

60
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:43,951
The particle field could be
interfering with the sensors.

61
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,651
We better beam down
for a closer look.

62
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,232
l'm still getting
a lot of interference.

63
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:05,140
The particle field
must be blocking

64
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:06,508
the tricorder functions.

65
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,341
The interference seems
to be coming from here.

66
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:20,821
This must be the source
of the field.

67
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:24,317
lt's probably some kind
of matter/antimatter reactor.

68
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:28,162
Lieutenant, l suggest we leave
before we're discovered.

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,531
Give me a minute.

70
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:39,366
Take all the time you want.

71
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,596
lt's about time.

72
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,067
Enter.
Where have you been?

73
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,569
l've been waiting hours...

74
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:58,273
M-Major.

75
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:01,506
Uh, l'm sorry, we're closed.

76
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:03,536
You'll have to come back
in the morning.

77
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:05,344
Oh, l didn't come here
for a drink.

78
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:06,542
l thought you'd like to know

79
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:08,950
your cousin Kono just tried
to come aboard the station.

80
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:11,045
Kono? Here?

81
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:12,578
What an unexpected pleasure.

82
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:13,647
He's gone, Quark.

83
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:15,158
When we tried to talk to him

84
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:17,717
he beamed onto a departing
Tellarite freighter.

85
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:19,058
There must be some mistake.

86
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:20,563
Why would Kono be coming here?

87
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:22,361
l was wondering the
same thing myself

88
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,730
so, l did a little checking.

89
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:24,859
Your cousin's wanted

90
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:26,870
for robbing a museum
on Cardassia V.

91
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:29,702
My guess is he thought
someone here would help him

92
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,764
sell the merchandise.

93
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,708
Outrageous.
You have no proof of that.

94
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:35,769
Quark, get this into that
little twisted brain of yours.

95
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,872
lf you thought
you were going to get away

96
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:40,076
with anything while Odo's
gone, think again.

97
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,345
l'm watching you.

98
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:46,082
Major?

99
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,216
You make it sound
like you don't like me.

100
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,889
Don't like you?

101
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,091
You collaborated
with the Cardassians.

102
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,666
You cheat your customers

103
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,827
and you're a danger
to this station.

104
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:02,134
l don't just ''not like you.''

105
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,867
l despise you.

106
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:10,277
Sorry l mentioned it.

107
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:14,013
A-A job?
What do l need a job for?

108
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:15,416
You're 15 years old.

109
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:18,421
lt's time you took
a little responsibility.

110
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:23,852
Look, Nog works, doesn't he?

111
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:25,191
Yeah.

112
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,527
You're almost as old as he is.

113
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:29,930
When l was your age,
l had a job

114
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,527
and it was
a terrific experience.

115
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:33,763
All right, l'll talk to Nog

116
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:36,329
and see if he can get me
a job at Quark's.

117
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,365
Quark's? l was thinking
more along the lines

118
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,674
of you helping out
Chief O'Brien.

119
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,202
Chief O'Brien?

120
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:45,977
You do like Chief O'Brien,
don't you?

121
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:49,679
He's okay, but l don't know
anything about engineering.

122
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,553
This is the perfect
opportunity to learn.

123
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:55,683
Besides, it'll look great
on your application

124
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,250
to Starfleet Academy.

125
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:03,796
Okay, l'll give it a try.

126
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,428
That's all l ask.

127
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,269
Are we being accused
of some kind of crime?

128
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:16,745
Have you committed one?

129
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,271
We've just arrived here.

130
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:20,977
So you keep saying.

131
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:23,316
lf you want,
you can check our ship's logs

132
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:24,912
and they'll prove it to you.

133
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:26,650
Logs can be tampered with.

134
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,180
Well, you ought to know that.

135
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:30,455
After all, you claim to be
a security officer.

136
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:33,554
l am a security officer,
and l've had enough of this.

137
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,691
lf we were guilty, we wouldn't
even be here right now.

138
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:37,758
l'll prove it.

139
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,065
Computer, one to beam up.

140
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,611
Don't worry,
he'll be right back.

141
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:58,721
What did l tell you?

142
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:01,350
Now, that's interesting,
you disappearing like that

143
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:03,019
because l've got 22 people

144
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,357
who have disappeared
without a trace.

145
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:09,628
22 missing people?

146
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,032
Did they all disappear
at the same time?

147
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:14,297
No, it started in the fall.

148
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:17,774
But the last victim vanished
six hours ago.

149
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,333
Six hours ago
we weren't even in this system.

150
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:22,937
lf you want, you can accompany
us back to our station

151
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,040
and they will verify
everything we've told you.

152
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:33,814
Do you have any other suspects?

153
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:36,018
You were my only ones.

154
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,052
l'm not saying
everybody here is perfect.

155
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:43,259
We have some petty thefts,
an occasional fight, but...

156
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,733
kidnapping, murder?

157
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:46,702
Nah. Nah, we've never had

158
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:48,864
anything like
that before.

159
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:51,067
l see.

160
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:52,268
So...

161
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:53,799
have you scanned the area

162
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,869
for signs of transporter
activity?

163
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:57,813
lt was the first thing l tried.

164
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,839
l didn't find anything.

165
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:03,679
You know, l've been protector
here for almost ten years.

166
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,688
l like to think
l'm pretty good at my job.

167
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:07,917
People trust me
to solve their problems.

168
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,222
But whoever's behind
these disappearances

169
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,229
is a lot smarter than l am.

170
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:18,963
l have to admit,
l'm starting to get desperate.

171
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:22,995
Maybe what you need
is a little help.

172
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:26,973
Maybe.

173
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:35,315
Rurigan.

174
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:43,293
So...

175
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,955
these are the strangers
l heard about?

176
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:48,624
Shouldn't they be in a cell?

177
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:51,896
l'm satisfied they have nothing
to do with the disappearances.

178
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:54,597
ln fact, Odo here
is a security officer.

179
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:56,629
He's going to try to help us.

180
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:58,573
How do you plan to do that?

181
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:01,510
l understand your daughter
is the latest victim.

182
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:03,809
When was the last time
you saw her?

183
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:05,542
This morning at first meal.

184
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:10,076
But Taya said she saw her later
in her workroom around midday.

185
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,246
Taya?

186
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:13,415
My granddaughter.

187
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:16,290
Colyus, Anetra's gone,
just like the others.

188
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:18,294
We're never going to find them.

189
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:19,955
How can you be so sure?

190
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:23,023
Let's just say l haven't
been proven wrong yet.

191
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,432
l'd like to scan the area again
for transporter activity

192
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:26,697
in case you missed something.

193
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:28,967
Go right ahead.

194
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:34,273
l'm still not getting
a clear reading.

195
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:37,041
The omicron particles
put out by the reactor

196
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,275
are creating
too much interference.

197
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:41,750
Oh, must be your equipment.

198
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:45,152
Our scanners
never give any trouble.

199
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,049
Certain kinds of transporters

200
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:52,289
leave behind a residual
electrostatic charge.

201
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,957
lf we could check
Anetra's workroom?

202
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,430
lf you don't mind

203
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,905
l'd like to talk
to your granddaughter.

204
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:07,001
Well, the last time l saw her,
she was across the square.

205
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:08,443
l'll take you to her.

206
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,587
Taya?

207
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:26,991
Don't be afraid, Taya.

208
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:29,291
This is a friend
of Protector Colyus.

209
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,696
He just wants you to answer
a few questions.

210
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:34,723
Do l have to?

211
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:38,101
Not if you don't want to.

212
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:42,403
But it would help
if l could talk to you

213
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:44,104
about your mother's
disappearance.

214
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:47,204
She hasn't disappeared.

215
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:49,375
She'll be back.

216
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:56,714
The last time
you saw your mother

217
00:12:56,757 --> 00:13:00,386
did she seem upset
about anything?

218
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:03,055
Nervous, perhaps, or worried?

219
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:04,926
She seemed fine.

220
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:09,164
When will she be coming home?

221
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:12,602
l don't know, Taya.

222
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,768
Let's go;
it's past your bedtime.

223
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:18,107
l'd like to ask
a few more questions.

224
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:23,279
lt'll wait till morning.

225
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:49,235
Chief, here's the new apprentice
we discussed.

226
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:51,107
Yes, sir.
Welcome aboard.

227
00:13:55,783 --> 00:13:58,911
Well, let's get to work.

228
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:01,251
l was just about to run
a diagnostic

229
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:03,017
on the primary system core.

230
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:04,217
Mr. Sisko...

231
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:07,193
l almost forgot.

232
00:14:07,227 --> 00:14:09,695
For you.

233
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,061
Thanks, Dad.

234
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:15,228
lt's standard equipment
for all station personnel.

235
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:30,849
Wait, let me get
this straight, Major.

236
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:33,216
You want me to spy
on Quark for you?

237
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:35,050
l wouldn't
call it spying, exactly.

238
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:38,081
l just thought you might,
you know, keep an eye on him

239
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,353
while Odo's away.

240
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:40,724
When you're not busy.

241
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:41,887
Oh, it's no problem, Major.

242
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:43,726
Then you'll do it?

243
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:44,731
l look forward to it.

244
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,733
Garak has been lecturing me
on surveillance techniques.

245
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,598
This'll give me a chance
to try some of them out.

246
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:50,626
Sisko to Kira.

247
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:51,660
This is Kira.

248
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:53,297
Major, l thought
you might like to know

249
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,830
we've received word
that Vedek Bareil

250
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,103
is coming aboard the station.

251
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,440
Coming aboard-- when?

252
00:14:57,478 --> 00:15:00,413
His ship just arrived
at Docking Bay 12.

253
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:11,149
l wish you'd given us
a little more notice.

254
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:13,250
We could have arranged
a formal reception.

255
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:16,353
Well, that's exactly
what l wanted to avoid.

256
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:18,524
What brings you to the station?

257
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:22,365
Prylar Rhit invited me
to speak at the station shrine.

258
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:23,392
Ah.

259
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:25,064
But to be honest, l...

260
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:28,871
l've been looking for
an opportunity to see you.

261
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:30,206
Really?

262
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:32,974
l'm honored.

263
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:34,378
Oh, honored.

264
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:39,944
Uh, actually, l was hoping
you'd be happy to see me.

265
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:42,421
Oh, l am.

266
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:44,253
Very happy.

267
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:13,876
Hello, Taya.

268
00:16:19,226 --> 00:16:20,488
Remember me?

269
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:22,461
We met last night.

270
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:25,397
You wanted to ask me questions.

271
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:26,524
That's right.

272
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:28,159
About your mother.

273
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:33,196
l understand you were
the last one to see her.

274
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:35,875
l guess.

275
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:40,808
What happened to your face?

276
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:45,641
Nothing happened to my face.

277
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:47,847
l'm a shape-shifter.

278
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:51,949
l just don't do faces very well.

279
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:56,827
l have the ability
to change my shape

280
00:16:56,864 --> 00:16:58,957
to look like other things.

281
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:01,524
You mean, you're a changeling?

282
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:03,593
That's right.

283
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:06,572
There's no such thing
as changelings.

284
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,336
They're make-believe.

285
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,002
Everyone knows that.

286
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:14,036
Well, l'm not make-believe.

287
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:18,347
All right, then let me see
you change into something.

288
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:21,247
Maybe later.

289
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:26,351
Right now, l feel like talking.

290
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:30,386
lf l were a changeling,
l'd change shapes all the time.

291
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,194
Everyone would want
to be my friend.

292
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:36,464
Ha. l wish it were that easy.

293
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:38,266
Why wouldn't it be?

294
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,901
When l was younger

295
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:46,902
people were always asking me
to change shape for them.

296
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:51,646
They'd pretend to be my friends,
but all they wanted

297
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:55,246
was to see me become a chair
or an animal.

298
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:58,884
None of them ever
really cared about me.

299
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:01,827
Maybe they were scared of you.

300
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:05,995
Some of them probably were.

301
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:08,967
l'm not afraid of you.

302
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,097
l'm glad to hear that.

303
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:17,408
Were your parents
changelings, too?

304
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:23,172
l never knew my parents.

305
00:18:23,217 --> 00:18:26,345
l've been looking for them
for a long time.

306
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:33,316
My father died when l was four.

307
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,726
l don't remember him very well.

308
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:40,264
The last time l saw my mother

309
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:46,000
she was in her workroom
making pottery.

310
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,533
When l went to get her for
the midday meal, she was gone.

311
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:55,709
How did she act
when you last saw her?

312
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:58,479
Happy.

313
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:02,750
She was making a vase
for Mr. Depnen, the baker.

314
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:04,723
He really likes my mom

315
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:09,218
so he always saves us
the best loaf of greenbread.

316
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:13,495
Has your mother ever gone
anywhere before?

317
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,314
A trip, vacation?

318
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:17,942
We don't go on trips.

319
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:18,972
Never?

320
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:23,613
No, we never leave the valley.

321
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:24,849
Why not?

322
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,825
Nobody ever leaves the valley.

323
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,625
Everything we need
is right here.

324
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:35,493
l see.

325
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:41,435
My mother's never coming back,
is she?

326
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,907
Why do you say that?

327
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:48,707
lt's what my grandfather
told me.

328
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:56,982
Taya, l don't know
where your mother is

329
00:19:57,022 --> 00:20:01,220
but l promise you,
l'm going to do everything l can

330
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,491
to find her
and bring her back to you.

331
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:14,805
Okay, one more time.

332
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,671
These are all isolinear rods.

333
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,541
The ones with the white labels
contain data

334
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:22,479
relating to the engineering
systems controls

335
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,038
the red-labeled ones

336
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:26,617
are for library
and information storage

337
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:29,951
and the blue ones are...?

338
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:31,580
l'm never going to get this.

339
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:33,147
Give yourself some time.

340
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,921
l didn't get a handle
on this stuff

341
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,360
until almost a year
after l joined Starfleet.

342
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:39,261
l mean, it's not
like you're going off

343
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:41,266
to the Academy tomorrow, is it?

344
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:44,795
What's wrong?

345
00:20:44,837 --> 00:20:45,997
Nothing.

346
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,734
lt's just that,
why does everyone assume

347
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:50,799
that l'm going to the Academy?

348
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:53,471
Well, you want to go,
don't you?

349
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:57,305
Not really.

350
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:00,744
Does your father know?

351
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:03,016
He wouldn't understand.

352
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,750
l know how you feel.

353
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,226
You know what my father
wanted me to be?

354
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,591
A musician.

355
00:21:10,796 --> 00:21:12,127
lt's true.

356
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:15,133
l was supposed to be
a cello player.

357
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:17,533
He made me practice
every day.

358
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,560
l got to be pretty good.

359
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:23,041
When l was 17, he sent
a recorded audition

360
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:25,769
to the Aldebaran Music Academy.

361
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:27,039
What happened?

362
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:28,407
Oh, l got in.

363
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:30,745
lt was the happiest day
of his life.

364
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:33,979
l didn't know how to tell him
l didn't want to go.

365
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:36,419
So, two days before
l was due to leave

366
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:39,390
l went into town
and signed up for Starfleet.

367
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,153
What did your dad do?

368
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:42,660
Oh, he was furious.

369
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:45,060
But once he calmed down
a little

370
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:47,688
he saw how much
l wanted to join.

371
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:51,066
Nowadays when l go home,
he introduces me as...

372
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,467
''My son

373
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:58,738
Senior Chief Specialist
Miles Edward O'Brien.''

374
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:03,714
The point is, you've got
to live your own life.

375
00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:05,717
l don't want
to disappoint my dad.

376
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:08,015
Hey, your dad's not a bad guy.

377
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:09,417
He'll come around.

378
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,479
Just give him some time.

379
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:28,764
So...

380
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,434
What did you think?

381
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,874
Of your speech?

382
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,969
Mm-hmm.

383
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:36,310
l liked everything about it...

384
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:37,838
except the content.

385
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:39,680
You disagree
with my interpretation

386
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:40,946
of the Eighth Prophecy?

387
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,716
''Disagree'' is a bit
of an understatement.

388
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:46,451
''Passionately disagree''
is more like it.

389
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,391
The way you have
of taking a prophecy

390
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:50,918
and showing that it can mean
exactly the opposite

391
00:22:50,963 --> 00:22:53,329
of the accepted
interpretation is...

392
00:22:53,365 --> 00:22:54,559
Oh, it's brilliant.

393
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,760
Uh... insightful.

394
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:58,702
lnfuriating.

395
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:02,264
Maybe we should talk
about something else.

396
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:03,740
Like what?

397
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:07,006
Well, the llvian
katterpod crop maybe?

398
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,512
Or, uh...

399
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:12,005
the new nature preserve
in Hedrikspool Province.

400
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:13,415
Hmm? No?

401
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:16,888
Maybe the standings in
the Springball Championship.

402
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:18,412
You follow springball?

403
00:23:18,457 --> 00:23:21,722
Religiously... if you'll
pardon the expression.

404
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,660
l even used to play a little.

405
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,026
Me, too.

406
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:27,930
l had Chief O'Brien design
a springball holosuite program.

407
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,399
Really?

408
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:31,595
Let's go.

409
00:23:31,637 --> 00:23:33,662
You want to play springball?

410
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,195
Why not?

411
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,040
Well, unless you have
a more pressing engagement.

412
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:41,044
Not that l can think of.

413
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:42,410
Good.

414
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:44,745
l could use the practice.

415
00:23:55,661 --> 00:24:01,896
From what l understand, you...
helped found this colony.

416
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:03,161
That's right.

417
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:05,533
l'm the oldest one left.

418
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,505
This colony must be
very important to you.

419
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,701
You helped found it,
you raised a family here.

420
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:14,405
l'm very proud
of what we've accomplished.

421
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:17,108
Then explain something to me.

422
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:21,142
This colony is undergoing
a serious crisis.

423
00:24:21,186 --> 00:24:24,314
Your daughter is
among the missing.

424
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:27,018
Yet, you hardly seem concerned.

425
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:30,323
There is nothing l can do
to change things.

426
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:32,353
l wish there were.

427
00:24:32,397 --> 00:24:35,560
Now, is there anything else,
or can l go?

428
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,728
Are you sure you're all right?

429
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,704
Why wouldn't l be?

430
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:43,037
You seem to be
in a great deal of pain.

431
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:44,975
Why do you say that?

432
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:49,176
l can see it in your eyes.

433
00:24:49,214 --> 00:24:52,274
Perhaps you'd like
to sit here for a moment

434
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:54,046
and rest.

435
00:24:54,086 --> 00:24:56,782
Well, it wouldn't do much good.

436
00:24:56,822 --> 00:24:58,881
You see, l'm dying.

437
00:24:58,924 --> 00:25:01,392
l'm sorry.

438
00:25:01,426 --> 00:25:03,451
Well, l've had a good life.

439
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:05,258
No regrets.

440
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:08,460
l wish l could see
my daughter once again.

441
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,435
Now, if there are
no more questions...

442
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:17,130
Actually, there is one thing
l've been wondering.

443
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:21,106
How come...

444
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,910
no one ever leaves the village?

445
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:25,576
l haven't met anyone yet

446
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:28,017
who's ever been
outside this valley.

447
00:25:28,053 --> 00:25:29,145
Any idea why?

448
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:30,916
l suppose it's because

449
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:33,424
people around here
don't like to travel.

450
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,551
After all,
there's no place to go.

451
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:37,357
How can you be so sure?

452
00:25:37,395 --> 00:25:39,727
Have you ever left the valley?

453
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:42,325
Now that you mention it...

454
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:43,834
no.

455
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:46,133
When l asked Colyus

456
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:47,968
if he searched
outside the valley

457
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,440
for the missing people,
he looked surprised

458
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:52,705
as if he'd never
thought of it before.

459
00:25:52,744 --> 00:25:54,041
l find that very peculiar.

460
00:25:54,146 --> 00:25:55,545
Where l come from

461
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,515
we would have searched
the entire countryside.

462
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,983
Yes.

463
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:04,478
l suppose Colyus thought
there was no point to it.

464
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,514
But l guarantee you...

465
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:09,959
there are no missing people
out there.

466
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:12,344
You're sure of that?

467
00:26:12,477 --> 00:26:14,570
Absolutely.

468
00:26:22,587 --> 00:26:26,785
And then the great Minra said
to the evil changeling

469
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:29,316
''Maybe you can turn
into a mountain

470
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:31,727
''or a Ghergher Beast
or a tornado

471
00:26:31,763 --> 00:26:35,290
''but those are big things,
and big things are easy.

472
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:38,359
''l bet you can't turn
into something small

473
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:40,462
like a loaf of greenbread.''

474
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:43,167
And the changeling
said, ''Yes, l can''

475
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,607
and he did.

476
00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:46,838
Then do you know what happened?

477
00:26:46,878 --> 00:26:49,676
The great Minra gobbled him up.

478
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:51,614
How'd you know that?

479
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,676
The changeling in your story
wasn't very smart.

480
00:26:58,056 --> 00:27:00,889
Could you turn into a loaf
of greenbread?

481
00:27:02,394 --> 00:27:04,259
l suppose l could.

482
00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:06,826
Show me.

483
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:10,266
And let you gobble me up?

484
00:27:10,302 --> 00:27:12,862
l don't think so.

485
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:19,134
See that tree?

486
00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:21,304
Sometimes we go there to play.

487
00:27:21,346 --> 00:27:25,339
That's the furthest l've
ever been from the village.

488
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:26,714
Wait here.

489
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:28,616
But l want to come see, too.

490
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:29,950
Please, do as l say.

491
00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:32,422
Lieutenant,
would you come with me?

492
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:41,494
l'm still not reading
any other life-forms

493
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:44,093
and no indication
of any power source.

494
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:47,634
Did you see that?

495
00:27:47,672 --> 00:27:49,663
lt, it just vanished!

496
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:53,371
lt happened just
as we passed those bushes.

497
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:57,708
Taya.

498
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:03,080
Taya, don't come any closer!

499
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:05,885
But l brought you
some Harrid berries.

500
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:29,977
Odo says you know what happened
to the missing villagers.

501
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:32,072
l think l do.

502
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:34,176
lt's a little
complicated to explain.

503
00:28:34,219 --> 00:28:36,744
lt'd probably be easier
if l showed you.

504
00:28:36,788 --> 00:28:39,188
May l have your cloak?

505
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:40,691
My... my cloak?

506
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:41,817
Please.

507
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,452
Well...

508
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,521
Thank you.

509
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,236
Now, stand back.

510
00:28:58,677 --> 00:29:00,201
l'm waiting.

511
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:02,110
This may take a minute.

512
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:04,707
l don't want to make a mistake.

513
00:29:10,822 --> 00:29:13,256
That was my favorite cloak!

514
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:15,782
Please, stay where you are.

515
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:32,570
Are you saying
somebody used our reactor

516
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:34,704
to transport the victims away?

517
00:29:34,746 --> 00:29:35,838
No.

518
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,347
lt's not a transporter.

519
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:39,179
lt's a holographic projector.

520
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:41,447
lt creates an omicron
particle field

521
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:43,351
and then manipulates the field

522
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:44,980
to form physical objects
like your cloak.

523
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:49,152
Well, what does this have to do
with the missing people?

524
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,963
The people are made up
of omicron particles, too.

525
00:29:56,101 --> 00:29:59,127
You mean they're...

526
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,694
holograms?

527
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:03,230
l'm afraid so.

528
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:05,708
You see, the component
that controls

529
00:30:05,744 --> 00:30:08,144
the particle field--
it's breaking down

530
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:10,613
and that's why people
are disappearing.

531
00:30:10,649 --> 00:30:12,139
Well, that's ridiculous!

532
00:30:12,183 --> 00:30:14,378
Some of the victims
were my friends.

533
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:16,011
One of them is my nephew.

534
00:30:16,054 --> 00:30:17,021
lf l'm right

535
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:20,957
everyone and everything
in this village

536
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:22,960
is a holographic projection.

537
00:30:22,994 --> 00:30:26,657
And l thought l was desperate
to find an answer.

538
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:28,165
Listen to her, Colyus.

539
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,565
l know this is difficult
to accept.

540
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:35,971
lt's going to take a whole lot
more than a vanishing cloak

541
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:38,976
to make me believe
l'm some kind of hologram.

542
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,205
l'd be skeptical,
too, if l were you

543
00:30:41,246 --> 00:30:42,838
but we have further proof.

544
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,610
What kind of proof?

545
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:48,580
The holographic field ends

546
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,453
just outside this valley,
and earlier today

547
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:53,650
Taya tried to reach
past the edge

548
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:55,353
and her arm disappeared.

549
00:30:55,393 --> 00:30:57,054
ls she all right?

550
00:30:57,095 --> 00:30:58,062
She's fine.

551
00:30:58,096 --> 00:30:59,461
Her arm re-materialized

552
00:30:59,497 --> 00:31:01,829
as soon as she pulled it
back inside.

553
00:31:03,735 --> 00:31:06,101
Where exactly did this happen?

554
00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:08,230
We could show you if you'd like.

555
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:10,571
l think you'd better.

556
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:18,212
l'm sorry.

557
00:31:18,249 --> 00:31:19,773
Don't apologize.

558
00:31:19,818 --> 00:31:21,945
l should have seen it coming.

559
00:31:21,986 --> 00:31:24,887
Where did you learn
to play like that?

560
00:31:24,923 --> 00:31:29,485
My brothers and l used to play
at the Singha refugee camp.

561
00:31:29,527 --> 00:31:31,893
There wasn't much else to do.

562
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,558
Yeah, l was at Relliketh.

563
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:38,432
And, uh, now...

564
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,768
uh, here we are.

565
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:45,899
Well, uh, uh, that, uh...

566
00:31:45,944 --> 00:31:47,775
that was delicious.

567
00:31:48,813 --> 00:31:50,508
Well...

568
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:52,413
thank the replicator.

569
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:55,579
Here, let me help.

570
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,985
That's not necessary.

571
00:31:57,021 --> 00:31:58,045
Your shoulder...

572
00:31:58,089 --> 00:31:59,818
Never felt better.

573
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:05,589
Maybe l do need
some help after all.

574
00:32:16,274 --> 00:32:19,004
l'll have to remember
to thank Prylar Rhit

575
00:32:19,077 --> 00:32:20,601
for inviting you here.

576
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:26,106
You'd better tell him soon.

577
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:28,142
Prylar Rhit...

578
00:32:28,186 --> 00:32:31,644
is going to be
returning to Bajor.

579
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:35,250
lt appears he fancies
himself something...

580
00:32:35,293 --> 00:32:36,851
of a dabo player.

581
00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:38,362
Oh... really?

582
00:32:38,396 --> 00:32:39,693
Mm-hmm.

583
00:32:39,731 --> 00:32:42,029
He's run up a...

584
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,432
sizable gambling debt.

585
00:32:46,304 --> 00:32:47,931
lt's caused...

586
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:50,566
quite a scandal
in the Vedek assembly.

587
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:57,277
Let me get this straight--

588
00:32:57,315 --> 00:33:01,479
the man who invited you
here to the station...

589
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,680
owes money... to Quark?

590
00:33:03,721 --> 00:33:04,847
To who?

591
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:06,055
The little troll
who runs the dabo tables?

592
00:33:06,055 --> 00:33:08,319
The little troll
who runs the dabo tables?

593
00:33:08,357 --> 00:33:09,824
l got to go.

594
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:11,121
But why?

595
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,957
l need to talk to Prylar Rhit.

596
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:16,293
l think l know the real reason
he invited you here.

597
00:33:21,737 --> 00:33:23,102
People, please!

598
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:24,572
Please!

599
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:25,596
Quiet!

600
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:30,439
Quiet!

601
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:31,969
Calm down!

602
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:33,412
Quiet!

603
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:34,473
Calm down, everybody.

604
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:36,144
We have to make a decision here.

605
00:33:36,185 --> 00:33:38,517
Colyus, you should be out
looking for my wife

606
00:33:38,554 --> 00:33:40,146
and all the others
who are missing!

607
00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:41,178
Not wasting time

608
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:42,952
listening to these strangers
and their lies.

609
00:33:42,992 --> 00:33:44,857
You all witnessed what happened

610
00:33:44,894 --> 00:33:47,624
when they brought us
to the edge of the field.

611
00:33:47,663 --> 00:33:49,995
Merruk, we both saw
your hand disappear.

612
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:51,691
lt could have been a trick.

613
00:33:51,734 --> 00:33:53,599
lt wasn't a trick.

614
00:33:53,636 --> 00:33:55,900
Then how come we've never
learned of this before?

615
00:33:55,938 --> 00:33:58,839
Because none of you ever tried
to leave the valley.

616
00:33:58,874 --> 00:34:02,435
lt's possible
we were programmed not to leave

617
00:34:02,478 --> 00:34:04,946
so that we wouldn't
learn the truth.

618
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,813
Now, we have
to shut down the system.

619
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,844
lf we don't fix it soon,
the whole village will disappear

620
00:34:12,888 --> 00:34:14,446
Dax...

621
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,516
you said if you can
fix the machine

622
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,054
you might be able to bring back
the missing people.

623
00:34:22,097 --> 00:34:23,928
We hope so.

624
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,729
What if you turn off
the projector

625
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:27,360
and you can't get it back on?

626
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:31,032
Then this village
will cease to exist.

627
00:34:33,642 --> 00:34:35,803
The system's
only a few months away

628
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:37,709
from complete failure anyway.

629
00:34:37,746 --> 00:34:40,977
At least this way, we have
a chance to save you.

630
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,610
Grandfather, please.

631
00:34:43,652 --> 00:34:47,554
Let her try.

632
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,455
What do you think?

633
00:34:51,126 --> 00:34:53,492
Well, we can't go on like this.

634
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:56,657
l guess we should
let her shut it down.

635
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,894
Are there any objections?

636
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,567
Then it's settled.

637
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:06,439
l can't wait to see my mother.

638
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,276
Your face isn't so scary...

639
00:35:14,316 --> 00:35:16,045
once you get used to it.

640
00:35:18,854 --> 00:35:20,788
Thank you, Taya.

641
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:30,558
All right, here we go.

642
00:35:46,915 --> 00:35:48,644
Odo...

643
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:50,845
Don't look so surprised.

644
00:35:50,886 --> 00:35:52,911
l'm as real as you are.

645
00:36:00,763 --> 00:36:04,324
l was happy living
on Yadera Prime.

646
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:07,426
That is,
until the Dominion took over

647
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:10,302
and changed
our whole way of life.

648
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:12,739
And l realized one morning

649
00:36:12,775 --> 00:36:16,472
that l didn't really
belong there anymore.

650
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,309
So l came here.

651
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:22,540
And l used a hologenerator

652
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:26,520
to recreate all the things
that l'd lost.

653
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:30,514
l have lived here in my village
for nearly 30 years.

654
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,960
And l've watched
the people marry...

655
00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:36,429
have children...

656
00:36:38,634 --> 00:36:39,965
grow old...

657
00:36:40,002 --> 00:36:44,530
and sometimes l even forgot
that they were holograms.

658
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:49,072
But it's over.

659
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:51,602
lt's over.

660
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:53,512
And l would appreciate it

661
00:36:53,549 --> 00:36:56,347
if you'd take me back
to Yadera Prime.

662
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:58,478
But what about the villagers?

663
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,784
What about your granddaughter?

664
00:37:00,823 --> 00:37:02,916
She's not real.

665
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,722
Technically,
l suppose you're right.

666
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:08,423
Maybe, by our definition,
Taya's not real.

667
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:10,932
Her memories are stored
in a computer.

668
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:13,729
Her body is made up
of omicron particles.

669
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:16,704
But who's to say
that our definition of life

670
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:18,206
is the only valid one?

671
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,641
l'm sure if you asked her,
she'd say she was real.

672
00:37:21,677 --> 00:37:24,646
She thinks, she feels.

673
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,706
She only seems to.

674
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,776
lt's all an illusion.

675
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:32,514
An illusion l created.

676
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:35,079
Well, you said you created
the village 30 years ago.

677
00:37:35,124 --> 00:37:36,250
Taya's only ten.

678
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:37,690
l designed the program

679
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:39,956
so the villagers
could have children

680
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:41,155
if they wanted to.

681
00:37:41,196 --> 00:37:44,063
Then Taya's personality
is a combination

682
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,896
of her parents' personalities.

683
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:47,299
Just like a real child.

684
00:37:47,336 --> 00:37:49,133
You had nothing to do with it.

685
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:51,105
But she's still a hologram.

686
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,573
Maybe...

687
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:53,905
but l saw the way

688
00:37:53,942 --> 00:37:56,069
you held her hand
when she was sad.

689
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:58,375
l saw the way
you tried to comfort her

690
00:37:58,414 --> 00:37:59,904
when she was frightened.

691
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:05,385
l... l didn't want her
to get hurt.

692
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:08,447
lf she's not real,
what does it matter?

693
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,923
lt matters.

694
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,220
lt matters to me.

695
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:15,162
Why should it matter to you
if a hologram cries?

696
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:20,962
Because l love her.

697
00:38:23,939 --> 00:38:26,533
And she loves you.

698
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:29,409
Don't you see?

699
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:30,935
She's real to you.

700
00:38:31,013 --> 00:38:32,913
And she's real to me, too.

701
00:38:32,948 --> 00:38:34,472
They're all real.

702
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:37,485
And you can't
turn your back on them now.

703
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:54,198
Jake, how was work?

704
00:38:54,236 --> 00:38:55,464
Okay.

705
00:38:55,504 --> 00:38:58,473
lt's kind of fun
working with Chief O'Brien.

706
00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:01,635
But it would be better
if l knew what l was doing.

707
00:39:01,677 --> 00:39:02,905
You'll get there.

708
00:39:04,112 --> 00:39:05,773
l guess so.

709
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:08,374
l'm glad you decided
to stick with it.

710
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:11,750
Yeah.

711
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:13,778
Dad...

712
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:19,893
l don't want to join Starfleet.

713
00:39:28,604 --> 00:39:30,196
Since when?

714
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:32,434
S-since forever.

715
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:36,376
Starfleet is too much like you.

716
00:39:36,411 --> 00:39:39,903
l need to find what's me.

717
00:39:39,948 --> 00:39:42,246
Does that make any sense?

718
00:39:42,284 --> 00:39:45,412
Perfect sense.

719
00:39:45,454 --> 00:39:46,682
lt does?

720
00:39:49,424 --> 00:39:51,415
lt's your life, Jake.

721
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,690
You have to choose your own way.

722
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:57,460
There is only one thing
l want from you.

723
00:39:57,499 --> 00:40:02,960
Find something you love
then do it the best you can.

724
00:40:03,071 --> 00:40:04,963
l'll try.

725
00:40:05,096 --> 00:40:06,495
Good.

726
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:09,591
Then you'll make
the old man proud.

727
00:40:10,835 --> 00:40:12,234
l'd better go study.

728
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,933
l'm still trying to figure out
those isolinear rods.

729
00:40:30,488 --> 00:40:32,046
Hello, Quark.

730
00:40:33,324 --> 00:40:34,518
Major.

731
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,187
To what do l owe this
unexpected pleasure?

732
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:39,287
l just thought
l'd let you know--

733
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,456
we caught your cousin

734
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:42,489
trying to slip back
onto this station

735
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:45,799
and guess what we
confiscated from him?

736
00:40:45,837 --> 00:40:48,203
Bone carvings.

737
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:50,799
Stolen from a museum
on Cardassia V.

738
00:40:50,842 --> 00:40:52,867
l always knew
Kono was no good.

739
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:55,311
l only wish
we could have caught

740
00:40:55,346 --> 00:40:57,246
the two of you together.

741
00:40:57,282 --> 00:41:00,149
Life is full
of disappointments.

742
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:02,153
By the way,
Prylar Rhit tells me

743
00:41:02,187 --> 00:41:03,711
that you encouraged him

744
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,121
to invite Bareil
onto this station.

745
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:08,824
That a crime?

746
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,555
Not at all.

747
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:13,086
l just wanted to thank you.

748
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:14,962
l found him very...

749
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:18,125
diverting.

750
00:41:30,348 --> 00:41:34,079
Not diverting enough.

751
00:41:36,988 --> 00:41:38,785
All right,
nothing to do now

752
00:41:38,823 --> 00:41:41,917
but reactivate the system
and see what happens.

753
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,120
Wait.

754
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:45,686
Lieutenant, l'd like
to ask a favor.

755
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,563
lf this works,
please don't tell the others

756
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,192
that l'm... not like them.

757
00:41:50,235 --> 00:41:53,762
l don't want to be treated
any differently than before.

758
00:41:56,374 --> 00:41:58,274
Of course.

759
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:25,297
Mother?
Mother?

760
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:27,327
Mother!

761
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:36,777
Well, you did it.

762
00:42:36,814 --> 00:42:38,475
We upgraded the
system's memory core

763
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:40,177
and realigned
the field generators.

764
00:42:40,218 --> 00:42:41,378
l don't think

765
00:42:41,419 --> 00:42:43,410
you'll have to worry
about anyone disappearing now.

766
00:42:43,454 --> 00:42:45,445
We just have to get used
to the fact

767
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,684
that we're holograms.

768
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:49,124
We're alive and we have
our families back.

769
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,060
That's the only
thing that counts.

770
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:52,790
l wonder who created all this?

771
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,732
Whoever it was,
did a fine job.

772
00:42:56,768 --> 00:42:58,326
They did, didn't they?

773
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:01,133
Well, it was good
working with you, Odo.

774
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:04,164
Next time you're
on this side of the galaxy

775
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,302
l hope you come by
and see us.

776
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:08,403
l would like that.

777
00:43:08,446 --> 00:43:10,778
We don't get
that many visitors.

778
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,112
Odo.

779
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,110
My mother's back.

780
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:18,383
l'm glad.

781
00:43:20,158 --> 00:43:22,217
You're leaving.

782
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,023
l'm afraid so.

783
00:43:25,797 --> 00:43:27,321
l'll miss you.

784
00:43:33,438 --> 00:43:35,668
l'll miss you, too.

785
00:43:37,442 --> 00:43:40,309
Thank you for bringing
my mother back.

786
00:43:40,345 --> 00:43:42,939
l hope you find
your parents, too.

787
00:43:46,484 --> 00:43:48,509
Thank you, Taya.

788
00:43:48,553 --> 00:43:49,918
So do l.

789
00:44:07,772 --> 00:44:09,000
Taya...

790
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:26,613
Computer, two to beam up.
