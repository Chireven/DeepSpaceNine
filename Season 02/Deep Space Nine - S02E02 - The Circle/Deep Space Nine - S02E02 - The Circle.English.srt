1
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:05,322
Last time on <i>Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:06,490
This is the emblem

3
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:08,055
of the Alliance
for Global Unity.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,863
They call themselves
the Circle.

5
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:12,028
What gives them the right
to mess up our station?

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,833
They're an extremist faction

7
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:16,397
who believe in Bajor
for the Bajorans.

8
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,409
l can't loan you
a Starfleet runabout

9
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:20,468
without knowing
where you plan on taking it.

10
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:24,243
To Cardassia lV to rescue
a Bajoran prisoner of war.

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,686
Come on.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,745
We have a ship waiting.

13
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:34,850
What you did today, Major,
was declare war on Cardassia.

14
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:36,793
Thankfully, they declined
the invitation.

15
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,989
What if l told you
that l knew someone

16
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:41,022
who could bring
stability to Bajor?

17
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,398
Someone who could
unite the factions

18
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:45,027
and give us a chance
to do our job?

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,937
Bajor doesn't need a man.

20
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:52,137
lt needs a symbol,
and that's what you are.

21
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,510
The Navarch needed to return
here to assume his new post.

22
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:58,948
He's been made the Bajoran
Liaison Officer to Deep Space 9.

23
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:01,612
l already have
a liaison officer.

24
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:03,314
Not anymore, you don't.

25
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,051
Major Kira is no longer
assigned to this post.

26
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,389
She's been recalled to Bajor.

27
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:11,794
And now, the continuation.

28
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,936
Frankly, Commander,
l'm surprised at your reaction.

29
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:26,834
Oh, l don't think much
surprises you, Minister.

30
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:30,370
But l was expecting you
to be celebrating.

31
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:31,507
l was under the impression

32
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,347
Major Kira has been
nothing but trouble...

33
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,750
Who gave you that impression?

34
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,988
Common knowledge.

35
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:40,355
Major Kira
has my complete respect.

36
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,654
She's been invaluable

37
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:43,684
in establishing
this command post

38
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,823
and now she's been dismissed
without anyone consulting me

39
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:48,298
and l don't appreciate it.

40
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:51,734
Commander, Starfleet
doesn't consult us

41
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,897
when they wish to promote
one of their officers.

42
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,134
Are you suggesting that this
is a promotion for Kira?

43
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:58,005
Certainly, it is.

44
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:00,034
We need to find
the proper spot for her.

45
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,047
After all, she's the one
who brought Li Nalas back to us.

46
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:07,242
Well, then,
that's a different matter.

47
00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:12,886
l'm glad you see it.

48
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,824
Yes, of course l do.

49
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,021
For a minute,
l was thinking to myself

50
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:19,826
''There's a warm wind
blowing in from Minicoy.''

51
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:26,898
l'm sorry?

52
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,963
lt's just
an old saying from Earth.

53
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:32,306
lt all started with a famous
ambassador from Minicoy

54
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:35,177
who used to bluster,
exaggerate and dissemble

55
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:36,612
to get what he wanted.

56
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,309
Not at all like you or me.

57
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,511
He was a bag of hot air

58
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:43,680
and everyone recognized him
for what he was.

59
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:48,125
May l assume you're satisfied
with the assignment of Li

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,185
to fill your vacant post?

61
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:51,889
l'd thought you'd want Li
to stay in the capital

62
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,693
to strengthen
the provisional government.

63
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:56,599
Frankly, l'm not sure
it's safe in the capital

64
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,694
with what's going on these days.

65
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:00,034
The Circle?

66
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,539
The fires and graffiti
were a nuisance

67
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:03,871
but two days ago

68
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,140
one of my fellow Ministers
was attacked and beaten.

69
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:10,808
We can't risk the same thing
happening to Li Nalas.

70
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:17,746
Look at it this way, Commander.

71
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:21,919
We're entrusting
Bajor's greatest hero to you.

72
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,927
Could you have

73
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,156
a better liaison
officer than Li Nalas?

74
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:26,824
l think not.

75
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,802
Commander, your son
has been waiting

76
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,270
to speak to you on the com.

77
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:36,504
Jake?

78
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,168
Dad?
l'm outside our quarters.

79
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:40,108
Could you come down
for a minute?

80
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:41,510
ls something wrong?

81
00:03:41,546 --> 00:03:44,014
l really think you ought
to come down, Dad.

82
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:45,880
On my way.

83
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:52,049
What's the problem?

84
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,216
Look.

85
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:03,284
Come in.

86
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,455
You're not...?

87
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,460
Leaving?

88
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,791
l really don't have
much choice, do l?

89
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,319
You're not just leaving, Major.

90
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:13,388
You're surrendering.

91
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:15,399
You break the rules, you pay.

92
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:16,400
Wait a minute.

93
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:18,061
l want to be sure
l heard that correctly

94
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:19,934
because it doesn't sound
like the Kira Nerys

95
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:22,303
who has made a career
out of breaking the rules.

96
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,830
Well, l guess l broke
one too many.

97
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,968
Major, you've been
breaking one too many

98
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,308
for 141/2 years.

99
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,576
Cardassian rules, Bajoran
rules, Federation rules--

100
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,549
they're all meaningless to you

101
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:34,745
because you have a personal code

102
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:36,583
that's always mattered more

103
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:39,988
and l'm sorry to say,
you're in slim company.

104
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,118
l'll miss you too, Odo.

105
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,125
Have you asked Sisko for help?

106
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,158
l'm sure he'll do whatever he
thinks is best for the station.

107
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:52,998
You haven't even gone to him?

108
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,835
Well, what do you
want me to do, Odo?

109
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,500
Fight for what you want!
lt's what you do best!

110
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,406
Well, maybe l just want
a vacation.

111
00:06:58,443 --> 00:07:00,843
Ach! ldiotic bureaucracy!

112
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,212
Now, l suppose they'll expect
me to break in a new man.

113
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:07,082
A great man-- Li Nalas
can handle the job, believe me.

114
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:08,710
Well, you did fairly well at it

115
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:10,463
once l smoothed
your rough edges.

116
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,063
Hah.

117
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:13,688
What's so funny?

118
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,224
l thought you did fairly well

119
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,601
once l smoothed
your rough edges.

120
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,232
Yes?

121
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,400
Am l disturbing anything?

122
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,408
Stick around.

123
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,909
You can help me cry
in my synthale.

124
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,003
l thought l should return
this epidellic lotion.

125
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,240
No. lf you like it...

126
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:28,804
Oh, it's wonderful.

127
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,076
Well, then keep it.

128
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:31,513
How can you be chatting
about skin lotion

129
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,075
at a time like this?

130
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,087
Do you have any idea
where you'll be stationed?

131
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,085
Come in.
Not yet.

132
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:37,985
They say that after l've
taken some leave time

133
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:38,991
l've earned a desk

134
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,255
at the Foreign Affairs
Building somewhere.

135
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,261
Doctor.

136
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,262
Foreign Affairs Building?

137
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,263
l came to give you my best.

138
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,264
Well, that's rather dull.

139
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,265
l beg your pardon?

140
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,425
Dull is a polite word for it.

141
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,524
Doctor, if you were Kira

142
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,832
wouldn't you at least be
complaining to Commander Sisko?

143
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,202
Look, l just wanted
to wish you good luck.

144
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,399
Thank you, Doctor.

145
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,600
Complaining about what?

146
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,108
Never mind, Doctor.

147
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,111
lf she doesn't care,
why should we?

148
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,805
Have they given you
any reason yet?

149
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:02,279
Did they give you
any alternative?

150
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,441
l do care.
No, they haven't.

151
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:04,449
No, they didn't.

152
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:05,814
l really ought
to finish packing.

153
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:06,977
You said she doesn't care.

154
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,884
You mean about
leaving the station?

155
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,218
By all means, come on in.

156
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,053
She's done well here.
She ought to stay here.

157
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,716
And l say she could use
a little support

158
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,783
from her friends, Doctor.

159
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,021
Well, yes, certainly, but...

160
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,495
Uh...

161
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,760
Chief! Come in.

162
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,596
l didn't mean to intrude.

163
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,692
l was just...

164
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,032
Don't worry, Chief,
it's all been said.

165
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,698
l have a good deal more to say,
thank you, Doctor.

166
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,706
Look, l could come back.

167
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,832
Odo, leave her alone.

168
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,239
This is Kira's
decision to make--

169
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,403
unless, of course, you
want me to talk to Sisko.

170
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,470
l knew what l was doing.
l knew the risk.

171
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,310
That's not what she asked.

172
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,748
l'd just like to say, Major

173
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,251
it's been a pleasure
serving with you.

174
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,412
Come in.

175
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,354
Will someone please explain
this conversation to me?

176
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,754
A party! Oh!

177
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,917
For you, l would have reduced
my catering rate.

178
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,926
lt's not a party.

179
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,927
Voodai.

180
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:49,928
What's that?

181
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,429
A bottle of my favorite
synthale, l think.

182
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,488
That's very thoughtful, Quark.

183
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:54,089
lt's also very small.

184
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,634
l was anticipating
a far smaller gathering.

185
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,194
l thought perhaps
an intimate farewell drink

186
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,364
a sympathetic smile...

187
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,033
a shoulder to cry on.

188
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,041
As l was saying, Major...

189
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,042
You'd be surprised

190
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,043
how often that works with women.

191
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,042
ls this a joke?

192
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,043
Did you plan this?

193
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,738
Nobody could have planned this.

194
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:10,943
Oh, we're open for business.

195
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,177
Come on in, join the crowd.

196
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,243
Vedek Bareil.

197
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:17,050
l hope l'm not interrupting.

198
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,386
No. Please come in.

199
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,449
These are my...

200
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:25,661
these are my friends.

201
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,770
l had no idea you were coming
to the space station.

202
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,966
Well, nowadays,
it's probably wiser

203
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,941
not to announce these things.

204
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,603
How bad is it on Bajor, Vedek?

205
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,205
The violence has
seriously escalated.

206
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,978
lt almost seems there are
more weapons on the street now

207
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,382
than during the occupation.

208
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,386
How could that be?

209
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,251
Where would they be coming from?

210
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,724
l try to concentrate
on more spiritual matters.

211
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,055
Yes, of course.

212
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,823
l mean... l didn't mean
to suggest that you...

213
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,763
l understand
your duties here are finished.

214
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,632
Yes, they are.

215
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,569
Do you have any immediate plans?

216
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:13,877
l haven't really had much chance
to give it any thought.

217
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,508
Then perhaps l have
the perfect solution.

218
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,384
Come and stay
at our monastery for a while.

219
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,880
lt can help when the spirit
gets a little bruised.

220
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,224
Thank you.

221
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,270
Major?

222
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,276
l just want you to know that,
uh...

223
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:23,839
if there's anything
l can do to help.

224
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,851
Major...

225
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,443
l'm sorry.

226
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,852
l didn't want this job.

227
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,483
Neither did l.

228
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:38,290
l mean, back when l was
sent here in the first place

229
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,096
but it, um, turned out
better than l expected.

230
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,103
l'm sure it will
for you as well.

231
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:48,937
l don't even know
what l'm supposed to do here.

232
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,704
How does a ''Navarch''

233
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:55,111
fit into
this command structure?

234
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,139
As l understand the position

235
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,414
you report directly
to the Prophets

236
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:03,080
but, from time to time,
l might ask your help.

237
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,486
Commander

238
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:10,860
anything you need from me,
l will try my best to do

239
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:16,232
but l know that l can
never replace Major Kira.

240
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,429
No one could.

241
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,439
Thank you, sir.

242
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:28,135
Request permission to disembark.

243
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,477
l'm going to get you back,
Major.

244
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,214
l promise that to both of us.

245
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,562
Docking Bay 3.

246
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,865
May l make
a friendly observation?

247
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,932
-lt's crooked.
-lt's crooked.

248
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,443
l've been adjusting it
for an hour.

249
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,911
lt looks fine from over here

250
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,880
but then l go
over there and it's...

251
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,577
This isn't working, Bareil.

252
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,678
lt's only a row of stones.

253
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,450
No, it isn't.
lt's me.

254
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,117
The stones are straight.

255
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:48,056
l'm the one who's crooked.

256
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,529
ls that really
how you see yourself?

257
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:52,860
Sometimes.

258
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,890
Sometimes l even like
being that way.

259
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,311
lf l stay here much longer

260
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,543
l'm sure l could destroy
your entire arboretum.

261
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:13,710
Well, perhaps you'd
rather try your hand

262
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,617
at woodcrafts.

263
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,387
Can l tell you something
very personal?

264
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,892
Of course.

265
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,621
You won't tell?

266
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,481
l'm a Vedek.

267
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:29,415
l have absolutely
no artistic skills.

268
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,421
l was the worst finger painter
at the four-year-old level.

269
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,888
My parents were humiliated.

270
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:36,256
lt'll be our secret.

271
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,091
The point is...

272
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,620
l'm useless here.

273
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,360
So?

274
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,837
So?
l need to feel useful.

275
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:51,864
lt might be interesting
to explore useless for a while--

276
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:53,876
see how it feels.

277
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,775
Oh...

278
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,009
Well, you don't know me.

279
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,517
l'm beginning to.

280
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,550
lt's time, isn't it?

281
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,452
Time?

282
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,551
Come inside with me.

283
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:13,586
l really should finish...

284
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,621
Come.

285
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:38,778
l've never been to this part
of the monastery before.

286
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:42,280
May it be the first
of many visits.

287
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:45,453
Bareil, maybe we
should talk about...

288
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:59,339
Oh, Bareil...

289
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,641
all my life, l dreamed of this.

290
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:20,929
lt is the Third Orb--

291
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:23,956
the Orb of Prophecy and Change.

292
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,701
What do l do?

293
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:36,337
Be useless, Nerys.

294
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:40,475
Allow the Prophets to guide you.

295
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,989
The Chamber of Ministers.

296
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,556
Dax.

297
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,064
Listen to them, Kira.

298
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,532
l can't hear them.

299
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,034
lt's all right.

300
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:00,559
Listen.

301
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,972
Can you hear them now, child?

302
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:12,777
l hear them, Major.

303
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:15,376
They're calling to me.

304
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:17,511
Don't listen to him, Nerys.

305
00:17:17,554 --> 00:17:21,354
Allow yourself to hear them.

306
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:24,053
They're calling to you.

307
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,157
Blasphemy.

308
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:30,999
Listen to them, Nerys.

309
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:32,558
Help me to hear them.

310
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:34,570
l don't know how.

311
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:36,936
But you do.

312
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:47,406
You do.

313
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:05,557
You do.

314
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,383
Last night alone,
we had dozens of beatings.

315
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,478
They're everywhere--

316
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,716
till we go looking for them

317
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:27,916
and then they're nowhere.

318
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:30,050
Which would suggest
they have powerful friends

319
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,957
to warn them and protect them.

320
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:33,292
Probably.

321
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:34,762
We've got to put a stop to this

322
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:36,060
before it gets out of hand.

323
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:37,566
Now, the provisional government

324
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,227
is bringing troops
into the capital.

325
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:40,395
Troops?

326
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:42,063
That will put an end
to the Circle.

327
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:45,369
And you keep your eyes open
up there, old friend.

328
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:48,074
l always do.

329
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,047
No, l haven't made any progress

330
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:54,208
in finding the ones
who assaulted you.

331
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,547
lt's over, Odo.

332
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:56,984
The investigation isn't closed.

333
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,044
lt's just...

334
00:18:58,087 --> 00:18:59,554
You don't understand.

335
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:00,715
lt's over.

336
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:02,156
What are you talking about?

337
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:03,216
Everything.

338
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,557
Bajor, the provisional
government

339
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:07,722
the Federation being here--
all of it.

340
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:09,026
We got to leave.

341
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:10,497
Well, l do anyway.

342
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,660
You can just turn into a couch.

343
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:15,170
You mean because
of this Circle business?

344
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:17,332
They're just
a bunch of hooligans

345
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,500
who use violence
to get attention.

346
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:22,170
l happen to know
they have enough weapons

347
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:25,204
and explosives and supplies
to support an army.

348
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,716
How do you know that?

349
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,718
l've been asking questions
of people

350
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,913
who don't answer questions
from people like you.

351
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:34,515
Where would the Circle
be getting so many weapons?

352
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:35,581
The Kressari.

353
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,922
The Kressari?

354
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,587
That doesn't make any sense.

355
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,892
The Kressari
don't even have a military.

356
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,397
They're botanic DNA traders.

357
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,424
Well, they're not
delivering flowers these days.

358
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:47,459
l know, Odo.

359
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:51,941
Computer, when's the next
Kressari vessel due here?

360
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:54,273
The Kressari Vessel <i>Calondon</i>

361
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:58,269
is scheduled to arrive
in 36 hours.

362
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,811
Do you know
where these weapons

363
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:03,375
are being sent to on Bajor?

364
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,613
No, not exactly.

365
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:05,712
Find out.

366
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,723
Are you out of your mind?

367
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:11,215
My plan is to put
as much distance as possible

368
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:13,559
between me and Bajor,
thank you very much.

369
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:18,096
Quark, l hate to do this,
but l guess l'll have to.

370
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,101
That's not fair.

371
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,534
l haven't done anything yet.

372
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,969
Whatever you're going to do,
it's not fair.

373
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:22,767
You're a deputy.

374
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,773
lt's not-- what?

375
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:25,774
You're a deputy.

376
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:26,775
l want you to find out

377
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,436
where the weapons
are going on Bajor.

378
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,208
Meanwhile...

379
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:32,407
l'm going to find out

380
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,348
exactly where
they're coming from.

381
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:36,511
You and me, a team?

382
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,315
That's right.

383
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:45,628
Good-bye.

384
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,960
Either that
or l'm putting you in a cell.

385
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,487
That's not fair.

386
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:51,056
On what charge?

387
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,125
lmpeding an investigation--

388
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:55,101
unless you want
to reveal the identities

389
00:20:55,138 --> 00:20:56,696
of the people
you've been talking to.

390
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:57,728
You know l can't do that.

391
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,642
lt's your choice.

392
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,271
You're a deputy
or you're a prisoner.

393
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:08,791
l'm a deputy.

394
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,738
l've got to go to Bajor.

395
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:16,239
Odo has some information

396
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:17,536
that suggests
we may be facing a coup

397
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:18,735
and l've got to check
things out.

398
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:20,038
ls there any way l can help?

399
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,945
Your military contacts--
see if you can get a feeling

400
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,813
for how much support
the provisional government has.

401
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,841
No problem. What about the
station while you're gone?

402
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:30,683
Dax and Mr. O'Brien
can handle things in Ops.

403
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,189
lf you need any other help...

404
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:33,588
Help?
l can't even sneeze

405
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,922
without three people
handing me handkerchiefs

406
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,052
but l was thinking

407
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,154
we might want
to establish a curfew.

408
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,324
Another cargo bay was
vandalized last night.

409
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:42,332
Good idea.

410
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:45,062
l've asked Odo
to assign you a bodyguard.

411
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,195
Oh, it's not necessary.

412
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:47,534
l think it is.

413
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,903
Docking Bay 1.

414
00:21:57,281 --> 00:22:00,546
Woodcrafts--
definitely the way to go.

415
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,416
ls that where the Prophets
led you?

416
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:06,116
Yeah. Lots of, uh,
hammers and nails and saws

417
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,681
surrounded by monks
and Vedeks--

418
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:08,749
very safe and secure.

419
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:11,023
You don't want to talk about it.

420
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:13,360
No.

421
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,903
Can l tell you something
very personal?

422
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,875
l'm not a Vedek,
but l can keep a secret.

423
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,243
The last time
l encountered the Third Orb

424
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,578
you were part of my vision.

425
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,607
Me?

426
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:36,620
lt's the reason
l came to the station

427
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:38,952
to invite you here.

428
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,457
What...

429
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:44,154
what part did l play
in your vision?

430
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:46,163
lt's not important.

431
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:50,190
l was just wondering
if l was part of yours.

432
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:53,533
No. No, you weren't.

433
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,600
How could there be a storm
on a day as lovely as this?

434
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,632
That's not thunder.

435
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:01,474
l know that sound.
That's gunfire.

436
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:05,710
What a pleasure to come upon
such a flowing exchange

437
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,719
of spiritual harmony.

438
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:10,015
Vedek Winn.

439
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:13,682
We've met before,
haven't we... Major?

440
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:14,952
Major...

441
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:16,516
Kira Nerys.

442
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,825
That's right.

443
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:20,296
Major Kira.

444
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:22,629
From the space station.

445
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,032
What brings you here?

446
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:26,400
l do, Vedek Winn.

447
00:23:26,437 --> 00:23:28,667
Good for you, Vedek Bareil.

448
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:32,540
After working so hard,
you deserve a little recreation.

449
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:37,142
Major Kira is here
to explore her <i>pagh.</i>

450
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:40,048
A worthy endeavor
for someone who has led

451
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:42,143
such a life of violence, child.

452
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:45,246
And l'm sure the Assembly
would have had no objection

453
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:48,053
to your encounter with an Orb

454
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:49,923
had Vedek Bareil consulted us.

455
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,294
No one has ever been held
to that formality.

456
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,992
You're right, of course.

457
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:59,298
But l've always consulted
with the Assembly in advance.

458
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,430
l think of it as a courtesy.

459
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:03,906
Nothing more, nothing less.

460
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:06,705
How long will you be with us,
Major?

461
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:08,678
l'm not sure.

462
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:13,673
Feel free to stay as many days
as you like.

463
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,583
Even a week, if necessary.

464
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:31,367
Have them withdraw
from the northeast quadrant.

465
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:32,528
Move them to join

466
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,731
the 14th column
south of the city.

467
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:46,342
General Krim.

468
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,978
l'm Benjamin Sisko.

469
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,851
We met during a session

470
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:52,355
of the Executive
Committee last year.

471
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,052
l remember, Commander.

472
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:58,027
l was impressed by your talk.

473
00:24:58,062 --> 00:25:00,553
As l recall, you disagreed
with all of it.

474
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:01,792
Yes.

475
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:04,130
But you presented
your arguments well.

476
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:05,829
What can l do for you?

477
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,963
l understand you're in command

478
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:09,939
of the forces
defending the city.

479
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:12,499
l'd hardly call it
defending the city.

480
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:14,238
There is concern
in some quarters

481
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,007
that the military is unwilling

482
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,412
to confront the forces
of the Circle.

483
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:21,111
l don't know with whom
you've been speaking, Commander.

484
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,143
l've been observing
troop movements.

485
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:25,815
Every time there is
a potential confrontation

486
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:28,381
the military withdraws
to a safer position.

487
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,156
You can't possibly appreciate

488
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,857
that this is Bajoran
against Bajoran.

489
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:36,765
l appreciate that the
provisional government

490
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,736
will stand only
if the military supports it.

491
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,201
We are all patriots, Commander.

492
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:45,333
We have intelligence

493
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:48,004
that the Circle is being armed
by the Kressari.

494
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:49,535
The Kressari?

495
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,877
l hadn't heard that.

496
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,717
We've been trying
to track the movement

497
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:58,722
of those shipments.

498
00:25:58,756 --> 00:25:59,780
lf we could determine

499
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,291
where they're stored,
then we can...

500
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:02,792
l'd like to know.

501
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,988
You'll be the first one
l contact.

502
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,189
Thank you.

503
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:09,961
There is one other thing,
General.

504
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,698
My First Officer,
Major Kira Nerys...

505
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,501
Yes, l know Major Kira.

506
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:19,134
l understand
she hasn't been reassigned yet.

507
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:22,339
lt would mean a great deal to me
to get her back.

508
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,405
That's out of my purview,
Commander.

509
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:27,849
You might want to discuss it
with Minister Jaro.

510
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:34,384
Commander Sisko...

511
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,689
you told me about the Kressari

512
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:40,219
before you asked the favor
regarding Kira.

513
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:47,867
You could have tried
to trade that information

514
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:49,031
for the favor.

515
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:51,768
l wouldn't do that.

516
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,038
l'll remember that about you.

517
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,034
He's calling again.

518
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:09,336
What do you think we should do?

519
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:13,509
l think he's getting
tired of seeing me smile.

520
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:17,179
Anything new
from O'Brien or Odo?

521
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,518
They haven't come up
with anything yet.

522
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:26,789
All right.

523
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,695
Put him on the screen.

524
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:31,599
l will give this a try.

525
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:34,159
l am First Officer Li Nalas.

526
00:27:34,204 --> 00:27:36,866
Can l help you?

527
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,568
Somebody better be able
to help me.

528
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:42,203
l have been delayed
for six hours.

529
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:45,806
l can assure you
the Kressari government

530
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:47,749
will lodge a formal protest.

531
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:49,012
My apologies.

532
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,383
Apparently, there has been
some confusion

533
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,013
with your manifest interface

534
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:55,923
in our computer inventory
system that had to be...

535
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,756
Yes, yes.
l know all of that.

536
00:27:57,794 --> 00:28:01,025
l didn't know they were going
to be opening

537
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,588
every container
in my cargo hold!

538
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:06,761
Do you understand
these are highly sensitive

539
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:08,600
herbaceous materials?

540
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:12,165
l am sure that all necessary
precautions are being taken.

541
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,143
This is ridiculous.
l have a schedule to keep!

542
00:28:15,178 --> 00:28:17,840
We should be able to have this
all cleared up in a few minutes.

543
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:21,146
That's what l was told
a few hours ago.

544
00:28:28,525 --> 00:28:30,993
Dax to O'Brien.

545
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:32,995
Yes, Lieutenant?

546
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:35,088
We don't want to hold up
the Kressari

547
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,655
any longer than necessary.

548
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:39,827
Well, there isn't much more
we can accomplish for now.

549
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:42,133
The ship's due back here
the day after tomorrow.

550
00:28:42,172 --> 00:28:45,164
Perhaps we'll be able to correct
any additional problems then.

551
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,335
Yeah, we'd come
to the same conclusion.

552
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,038
O'Brien out.

553
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:52,708
A fair voyage to you, Captain.

554
00:28:55,952 --> 00:28:58,045
Prepare for immediate departure.

555
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,330
Major.

556
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,967
Commander.
l didn't hear you.

557
00:29:22,312 --> 00:29:26,112
l'm sorry if l interrupted
your meditation.

558
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:27,912
Daydream.

559
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:29,077
Daydreaming...

560
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:33,987
l think l remember doing that
a long, long time ago.

561
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,617
l've discovered
it's like riding a bicycle.

562
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,786
lt comes back to you
right away.

563
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:41,262
Can l bring you
back to reality for a minute?

564
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:43,857
Back to reality...

565
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,494
or back to DS9?

566
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,561
Are you still interested?

567
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:51,301
A lot has happened here.

568
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:56,973
l encountered an Orb,
Commander.

569
00:29:57,013 --> 00:30:00,540
lt's given me
a great deal to think about.

570
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:03,552
They do have a way
of doing that, don't they?

571
00:30:05,521 --> 00:30:06,715
Well...

572
00:30:06,756 --> 00:30:09,987
l just came to let you know
that we haven't given up yet

573
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:10,993
but for the moment

574
00:30:11,027 --> 00:30:12,517
there seem to be
some bigger problems

575
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:13,654
for the leaders down here.

576
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:17,029
l heard the gunfire
in the distance.

577
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:20,365
That distance is getting closer.

578
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,871
The Circle is for real, Major.

579
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,238
They've been armed for a coup.

580
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:27,266
And l'm not at all convinced
that the military

581
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,710
is going to back
the provisional government.

582
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,715
l didn't realize it...

583
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:37,918
We've been so isolated.

584
00:30:39,122 --> 00:30:41,716
Well..

585
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,352
l guess l'd better get back.

586
00:30:44,394 --> 00:30:46,259
Commander...

587
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:50,325
Me, too.

588
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:54,669
l told you l haven't given up.

589
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:27,536
Begin transport.

590
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:37,239
l think you'll find
everything's in order.

591
00:31:43,086 --> 00:31:44,451
Very well.

592
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,478
lf you'll sign off
on the shipment

593
00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:47,750
we'll be on our way.

594
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:53,252
Return transport.

595
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:13,038
Good afternoon.

596
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:29,354
So... you're involved
with the Circle.

597
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:30,696
l am the Circle, Major.

598
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:32,826
Now l understand why you wanted

599
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,303
to ship Li Nalas
off to the station.

600
00:32:35,338 --> 00:32:38,034
The last thing l need right now
is a great war hero

601
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:40,632
capturing the devotion
of the Bajoran people.

602
00:32:40,676 --> 00:32:43,144
How can you betray
your own government?

603
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:45,477
Major, l don't have to tell you.

604
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:48,143
l've heard your opinion
of this government.

605
00:32:48,184 --> 00:32:49,412
Government?

606
00:32:49,452 --> 00:32:51,352
They can't even agree
it is a government

607
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,877
so they call it ''provisional.''

608
00:32:52,922 --> 00:32:55,413
lt's just another word
for powerless.

609
00:33:01,197 --> 00:33:04,826
l won't allow the Bajoran people
to be powerless anymore.

610
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:07,427
We have been doormats

611
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,166
to the Cardassians,
and now the Federation--

612
00:33:10,206 --> 00:33:12,504
any great power that happens by.

613
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,669
We will not be that again.

614
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:19,340
We are a people who brought art
and architecture

615
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:20,610
to countless planets.

616
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,550
We don't deserve to be victims.

617
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:25,520
lf you want to change
the government, Minister Jaro

618
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:27,182
you vote to change it.

619
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:30,215
You don't sneak up
from behind it with a dagger.

620
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,022
We'll discuss politics
at another time.

621
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:35,394
l need to know, please,
what the Federation will do

622
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,626
once our objective
becomes clear.

623
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:46,166
Major, l've heard you have
no love for the Federation.

624
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:47,870
l'm not an unreasonable man.

625
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,673
l'm willing to send you back
to the station

626
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:50,906
if that's what you want.

627
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:54,007
l'll give you that station
after we get rid of Starfleet.

628
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,018
Now, do you believe
they will continue

629
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:57,713
to support
the provisional government?

630
00:33:57,753 --> 00:33:59,380
How about our own military?

631
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:02,414
l'd worry about them first
if l were you.

632
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,261
What will the Federation do,
Major?

633
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:07,387
What will Sisko do?

634
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,557
You know him better
than any Bajoran.

635
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:19,616
No one despises the Cardassians
more than l, Major

636
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:22,924
but we did learn
a few things from them.

637
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:25,897
Like how to encourage people
to talk.

638
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:28,162
Let's go.

639
00:34:36,843 --> 00:34:39,869
Bareil says there were
no signs of a struggle.

640
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,971
Maybe somebody saw them leave.

641
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,812
That's what we need to find out.

642
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:47,217
What if they transported
her off the grounds?

643
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,720
Let's hope they didn't.

644
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:51,087
Now, we can't expect much help
from the local authorities.

645
00:34:51,124 --> 00:34:52,182
They've got their hands full.

646
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:55,786
Commander, l should be able
to get some cooperation.

647
00:34:55,828 --> 00:34:57,955
lf my name carries any weight,
let's use it.

648
00:34:57,997 --> 00:34:58,861
Good.

649
00:34:58,898 --> 00:34:59,865
When's Odo due back?

650
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:01,696
Not for another 12 hours.

651
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:05,363
Who needs Odo when you've got
his number one deputy?

652
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:07,305
Quark, this isn't the time.

653
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,137
No, this is exactly the time.

654
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:11,109
l think l know
where you can find Kira.

655
00:35:11,144 --> 00:35:12,202
Go on.

656
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:15,442
You see, uh, Odo blackmailed me
into helping him.

657
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:16,948
A matter which l've been meaning

658
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,608
to bring to your attention,
Commander.

659
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:19,709
Quark.

660
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:21,310
l managed to find out

661
00:35:21,354 --> 00:35:23,948
where the Circle's
headquarters is.

662
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,584
ln the labyrinths beneath
the Perikian peninsula.

663
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,093
Sisko to security.

664
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,355
Go ahead.

665
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:30,953
l need a couple of officers

666
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,089
to go on a rescue mission
to Bajor.

667
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,622
Report to Runabout Pad C.

668
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:35,634
On our way.

669
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:37,966
Doctor, Lieutenant,
you're with me.

670
00:35:38,037 --> 00:35:41,234
Mr. O'Brien,
you'll be our pilot.

671
00:35:41,274 --> 00:35:42,434
Configure the runabout sensors

672
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:43,806
for a full sweep
of the peninsula.

673
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:46,141
Once we find the base,
l'll depending a great deal

674
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:47,806
on your famous
transporter talents.

675
00:35:47,847 --> 00:35:48,814
Aye, sir.

676
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:50,975
Commander, l'm going.

677
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,677
No, it's too dangerous.

678
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:55,278
Don't you understand?
l can do this.

679
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:57,516
l don't know what it means
to be a Navarch

680
00:35:57,557 --> 00:36:00,526
but l can fight in the trenches
and l take orders well.

681
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,825
Besides, l owe her one.

682
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:08,333
Dax, you're in charge.

683
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,892
We can discuss appropriate
compensation for this

684
00:36:10,937 --> 00:36:12,700
at a more convenient time!

685
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:22,145
Need one.

686
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,914
Check all the settings
on those phasers.

687
00:36:28,154 --> 00:36:29,951
Two men, Sector B.

688
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,182
Take your positions.

689
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:32,521
Yes, sir.

690
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:50,442
Only five, but they've got
more firearms

691
00:36:50,476 --> 00:36:52,171
than a Galaxy-class starship.

692
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:57,176
Where the hell's it coming from?

693
00:36:58,518 --> 00:37:00,952
All right, straight power play.

694
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:02,716
Nothing fancy.

695
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:05,087
Expect heavy resistance.

696
00:37:05,124 --> 00:37:06,921
Anyone who finds Kira

697
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:10,554
pin this on her, and call
for transport immediately.

698
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:13,765
Let's do it.

699
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,309
Kira!

700
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:51,694
Chief, get us out of here!

701
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:06,343
We don't have time for this.

702
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:10,747
Ow, ow.
Ouch.

703
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,757
Do not talk.

704
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,452
We have to assume
Jaro will move quickly

705
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:14,686
now that we've got you back.

706
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:16,194
Li is the only
chance we've got.

707
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:17,560
Me?

708
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:20,589
Jaro knows you're the only
force that could stop him.

709
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:23,158
lf we could get him to the
Chamber of Ministers...

710
00:38:23,202 --> 00:38:24,328
lt's much too great a risk.

711
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,338
He'd be dead before he
had a chance to speak.

712
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:28,499
Courtesy of a Cardassian weapon.

713
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:31,442
The Circle's being supplied
by the Cardassians.

714
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:32,444
What?

715
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:34,343
l borrowed the proof.

716
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,281
lt's got a Gul's thumb scan
on it.

717
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,250
The Circle hates
the Cardassians.

718
00:38:39,285 --> 00:38:41,048
They don't know
it is the Cardassians.

719
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:43,612
They think they've been buying
from Kressari traders.

720
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:44,850
l don't understand.

721
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,380
Why would the Cardassians

722
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:48,586
want to help Jaro
if he hates them?

723
00:38:48,628 --> 00:38:51,358
Because it gets them
what they want the most.

724
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:52,455
Rid of us.

725
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:54,125
They're just using Jaro.

726
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,964
Once the Federation
is forced to leave...

727
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,732
The Cardassians come back.

728
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:00,500
We've got to do something.

729
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:02,473
l've got to do something.

730
00:39:05,278 --> 00:39:06,643
Sisko to Ops.

731
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,907
Go ahead.

732
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:10,278
Dax, open a channel to Bajor.

733
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:12,250
Tell them that Navarch Li Nalas

734
00:39:12,285 --> 00:39:15,448
wants to address the Chamber
of Ministers on subspace.

735
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:17,149
l can't do it, Benjamin.

736
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,680
All frequencies
to Bajor are jammed.

737
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:22,751
We lost all communication with
the planet five minutes ago.

738
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,285
Then, it has started.

739
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:30,697
Get me Admiral Chekote
at Starfleet Command.

740
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:43,341
l feel the Prophets
smiling on me today, Vedek.

741
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:47,409
The Prophets have rarely
encountered a <i>pagh</i>

742
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:50,889
as forceful as yours,
Minister Jaro.

743
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,529
So, what's it to be, Winn?

744
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:59,690
Be?

745
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:03,168
Don't tease me.

746
00:40:03,202 --> 00:40:07,366
l can't interpret
the prophecies for you, Essa.

747
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,874
l know the future.

748
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,968
lt belongs to me.

749
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:14,979
l don't need
your interpretation.

750
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:16,981
Then what?

751
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,211
Your support.

752
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,880
l've made it very clear
to you how l feel.

753
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:26,221
Your public support.

754
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:30,888
Support from the Vedek
of an order so small as mine

755
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,899
surely would not be significant.

756
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:41,567
You stand for a return...
to orthodox values, as do l.

757
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,235
We're a match
made by the Prophets.

758
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:47,837
l wish there were more
with that opinion.

759
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,314
Unfortunately, as my assembly

760
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:53,512
approaches the selection
of a new Kai

761
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:56,851
l fear my voice is rarely heard.

762
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,356
That can change.

763
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:01,417
Can it?

764
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,793
Think of the prestige of having
the new leader of Bajor

765
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,661
being a member of your order.

766
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:11,163
lf you are the new leader.

767
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:15,838
Have the Prophets given you
a reason to doubt it?

768
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:18,400
l didn't say that.

769
00:41:23,182 --> 00:41:26,174
Then let them bless
my ascension.

770
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:29,346
Tell the people
the Prophets are with me.

771
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:34,159
That's a lot to ask.

772
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:36,252
l know that.

773
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,725
l need more than just prestige,
Essa.

774
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,394
l know that, too.

775
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:47,167
The people need leadership
to return to the old values--

776
00:41:47,206 --> 00:41:50,039
yours and mine.

777
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:55,310
l can think
of no one more worthy

778
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:57,440
of being the next Kai
than you, Winn.

779
00:41:57,483 --> 00:41:59,849
l shall do everything
in my power

780
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:01,375
to see that you are.

781
00:42:04,323 --> 00:42:08,487
The Prophets are smiling
on you today, Minister.

782
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:22,530
Dax?

783
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:24,941
l have Admiral Chekote
on subspace.

784
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:26,274
ln my office.

785
00:42:26,312 --> 00:42:28,940
Commander, two assault vessels
are headed this way

786
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:30,448
on direct course from Bajor.

787
00:42:30,483 --> 00:42:33,452
They've given all non-Bajorans
seven hours to evacuate.

788
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,859
Admiral, are you up-to-date
on my communiqués?

789
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:44,090
l think so, Commander.
How's it look?

790
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:46,461
Not good--
Jaro has the military

791
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:48,194
communications have been cut off

792
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:50,134
and assault vessels
are on their way here.

793
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:51,727
Are you preparing to withdraw?

794
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,000
Admiral, we've just
obtained evidence

795
00:42:54,106 --> 00:42:55,664
that the Circle's
been receiving weapons

796
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:56,902
from the Cardassians.

797
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:59,433
lf we withdraw,
we'll be giving Bajor--

798
00:42:59,478 --> 00:43:01,173
and the wormhole-- back to them.

799
00:43:01,213 --> 00:43:02,703
Damn.

800
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:05,239
That's a hell of a turn.

801
00:43:05,284 --> 00:43:07,946
How can these Bajorans
get in bed with the Cardassians?

802
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:10,521
They don't even know
the Cardassians are involved.

803
00:43:10,556 --> 00:43:11,955
Then you're saying that it's

804
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:14,459
a genuine political revolution
internal to Bajor.

805
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:16,552
Supported by the Cardassians.

806
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,961
But internal to Bajor.

807
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:21,965
The Cardassians
might involve themselves

808
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:25,197
in other people's civil wars,
but we don't.

809
00:43:25,237 --> 00:43:27,569
The Prime Directive applies,
Ben.

810
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:30,870
Admiral.

811
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:34,539
Would you say that our people
on the station are in danger?

812
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,706
Yes.

813
00:43:35,748 --> 00:43:38,308
Then there's no other choice
but to evacuate.

814
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,544
We'll have to worry

815
00:43:39,585 --> 00:43:42,213
about the long-term
political implications

816
00:43:42,254 --> 00:43:43,221
down the road.

817
00:43:43,255 --> 00:43:45,052
That's an order, Commander.

818
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:54,490
Chief, how long will it take us
to evacuate Deep Space 9?

819
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:56,797
l'd say we could have
all of our people

820
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:58,666
out and away in... three hours.

821
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:00,501
l mean a complete evacuation.

822
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:04,168
l intend to take all Starfleet
instruments, materiel...

823
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:07,110
in fact, all Federation
property of any kind.

824
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:08,841
How quickly can we do that?

825
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:12,647
Well, sir, that'll take days--
one week, for all l know--

826
00:44:12,685 --> 00:44:16,883
but those assault vessels are
going to be here in seven hours.

827
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:24,695
Then, l guess some of us
won't quite be done

828
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,322
by the time they get here.
