1
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:47,128
The Cardassian Freighter <i>Bok'Nor</i>
is requesting permission

2
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,572
to depart Upper Pylon 1
in three minutes.

3
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:51,735
We have an incoming
Bolian vessel

4
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:53,768
at coordinates 101 mark 38.

5
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:55,211
Give the <i>Bok'Nor</i>
a clear trajectory

6
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,372
out of the traffic pattern.

7
00:00:56,415 --> 00:00:58,212
Acknowledged.

8
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,218
Feel like getting together
for dinner tonight?

9
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:03,015
Can't. l'm having dinner
with Captain Boday.

10
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:04,113
The Gallamite?

11
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:05,953
You're going
out on a date with him?

12
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:08,289
ls something wrong with that?

13
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:10,921
No... not at all.

14
00:01:10,962 --> 00:01:12,725
He happens to be brilliant.

15
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:15,096
His brain is twice the size
of yours and mine.

16
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:17,101
l know, l've seen it.

17
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:20,627
lt's not his fault Gallamites
have transparent skulls.

18
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:22,105
No, it's not.

19
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,168
lt's... not exactly the view
l want to have with dinner.

20
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:29,907
You know, Kira,
sometimes l think you place

21
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:32,041
too much emphasis
on how men look.

22
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:33,574
What's that supposed to mean?

23
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:35,415
Nothing.

24
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:37,649
Look, when l kiss a man
good night

25
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:40,157
l like to know
where l'm kissing him.

26
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:43,628
l guess seven lifetimes gives me
a somewhat broader perspective.

27
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:45,527
Well, since l just have
one lifetime

28
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,498
l have to be
a little more particular

29
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:48,863
about whom l go out with.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,198
l never said
l wasn't particular.

31
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,534
l'm not the one
who dates Ferengis.

32
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,301
And what's that
supposed to mean?

33
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,705
Nothing.

34
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:03,113
Releasing docking clamps
at Upper Pylon 1.

35
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:06,147
That's funny.

36
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:08,550
l'm picking up elevated...

37
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,953
DS9 to <i>Bok'Nor.</i>
Shut down your engines.

38
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:12,957
Repeat.
Shut down your engines!

39
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:19,129
Report.

40
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:20,859
Some kind of impulse overload.
Checking.

41
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:22,457
Ops to all
engineering personnel.

42
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:23,763
Report to rescue stations.

43
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:26,134
We have an S.l.D. in progress.

44
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:28,401
There's nothing left of it.

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,965
There's no one left to rescue.

46
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,840
Kelindide, rodinium--

47
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,938
nothing unusual there.

48
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:46,109
All materials commonly used
in Cardassian ship construction.

49
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:48,745
Maybe it was a malfunction
in the impulse generator.

50
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:51,017
l'd like to be able
to tell you that, Major

51
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,523
but it's too soon to be sure.

52
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:54,115
l can't believe the Cardassians

53
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:56,683
have waited this long
for an official explanation.

54
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:57,820
Anything, Chief?

55
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,921
No sign of an explosive device
yet, sir.

56
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:02,627
l've got every Admiral within
subspace range on my back.

57
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:05,659
Can l at least tell them
that it looks like an accident?

58
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,501
Well, l wouldn't do that yet.

59
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,801
When?

60
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,864
l'll let you know, sir.

61
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:11,637
Anything from the Cardassians,
Commander?

62
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:12,870
Not a word.

63
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,038
All Bajoran outposts
have been put on alert

64
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,672
for retaliatory strikes.

65
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:19,081
The provisional government
has made a statement

66
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:20,742
disavowing any responsibility.

67
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:22,514
Maybe it really was an accident.

68
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:24,078
l mean, it is a possibility.

69
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:25,555
An accident involving

70
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,081
a Cardassian ship
in Bajoran space?

71
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:30,959
lf l were a Cardassian,
l wouldn't easily accept...

72
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:32,258
That's odd.

73
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:33,594
What?

74
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:36,100
l'm picking up traces
of a mercassium compound.

75
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:37,828
Mercassium?
There shouldn't have been

76
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:40,030
any mercassium
on board that ship.

77
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:41,732
Well, there was.

78
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:42,831
Meaning?

79
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:44,341
l'm not quite sure yet.

80
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,207
Well, is mercassium
some kind of explosive?

81
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:48,235
No, it's a synthetic composite

82
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,407
used in shield generator
construction

83
00:05:50,448 --> 00:05:52,006
by the Federation.

84
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,450
We don't share that technology
with anyone.

85
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:57,580
Chief, l don't think you're
going to find any evidence

86
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:58,589
of an explosive device.

87
00:05:58,623 --> 00:05:59,590
Lieutenant, respectfully

88
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:01,319
these kinds of things
take time, and l...

89
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,792
l don't think
you're going to find

90
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:04,488
any evidence
of an explosive device

91
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:05,689
because l'm pretty sure

92
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,960
it was an implosive
protomatter device

93
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,433
designed to match
the impulse signature.

94
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:11,992
Just before the explosion

95
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:13,868
l picked up a sudden increase

96
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:15,202
in their fusion rate.

97
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,367
l've been trying to find
any sign of malfunction

98
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:19,343
in the <i>Bok'Nor's</i>
engines to explain it

99
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:20,639
but there just isn't one.

100
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,204
This doesn't look
like an accident.

101
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:24,909
The fusion shock
had to be caused

102
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:27,577
by something external
to the impulse drive system.

103
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:30,349
lf a protomatter device
was attached to the cross-feeds

104
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:32,083
that could have created
the overload

105
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,851
and we'd never see
any sign of it.

106
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:35,359
Can you prove
that's what happened?

107
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:36,690
Maybe

108
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,559
if we can get
a high resolution spectra

109
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:39,585
of the impulse debris

110
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:40,928
but that's going to take...

111
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,432
Time.
Yes, l know.

112
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:43,695
Get it started.

113
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:45,669
l'll tell the Admirals.

114
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:46,966
Sisko out.

115
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,437
Benjamin.

116
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:51,464
Ah.

117
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:55,510
Cal, thanks for coming
on such short notice.

118
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:57,845
l wish it didn't take
a disaster like this

119
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:59,543
to bring us back together again.

120
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,108
Hi, Calvin.

121
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,585
Jadzia Dax.

122
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:06,613
Dax?!

123
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,384
My goodness!

124
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:12,863
Well, you look a lot better
than when last l saw you.

125
00:07:12,897 --> 00:07:14,364
Chief of Security Odo.

126
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,492
Commander Calvin Hudson

127
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:18,900
Starfleet's attaché to
the Federation colonies

128
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:20,427
in the new
Demilitarized Zone.

129
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:22,201
You must be concerned about

130
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,073
the colonies' security
at a time like this.

131
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:26,973
Well, we haven't noticed
any unusual deployment

132
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,501
from the Cardassians
along the border.

133
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:31,481
Neither have we, and that's
what's got me worried.

134
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,177
Let's go into my office.

135
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:35,846
Lieutenant, l don't
have time this trip

136
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:39,220
but you and l have a few stories
to catch up on.

137
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:42,693
-Next time.
-Next time.

138
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:46,663
That woman knows more about me
than any woman ever has.

139
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:48,427
More than my wife, even.

140
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,093
Tell me about it.

141
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:53,331
Don't you find things
a little uncomfortable?

142
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:56,602
Oh, no, she's a good officer.

143
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:58,336
Yes, but Curzon was...

144
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:00,401
She's not Curzon.

145
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:02,743
Now, you two aren't, l mean...

146
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,146
Oh, no.
She may not be Curzon

147
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,812
but she is Dax.

148
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:13,347
Yes, that would be
extremely... strange.

149
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:16,849
So, Ben, how is Jake?

150
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,987
As tall as me.

151
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:19,257
No!

152
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:21,595
He throws inside to knock
the old man off the plate.

153
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,260
A little chin music, huh?

154
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,895
Yeah, he's growing up
too fast.

155
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:28,531
Yeah.

156
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:33,169
lt must have been difficult
for you.

157
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:36,874
At least l didn't have
a child to raise by myself.

158
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:41,614
Well, we kind of helped
each other through it.

159
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:45,252
l heard about Gretchen.

160
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,918
l wanted to be there for you.

161
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,554
There was just
no way to get back.

162
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:53,894
l know that, Ben.

163
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:55,092
You know, l was hoping

164
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,998
when they sent me
to the colonies

165
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:59,265
that you and l would
have a little time

166
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:00,601
for some R&R together.

167
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:02,037
Who's got R&R time?

168
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,903
l know.

169
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:06,775
You can't imagine
how my life has changed

170
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:10,042
since the Federation
abandoned these colonies.

171
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:11,048
Abandoned them?

172
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:12,379
Doesn't your presence...?

173
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,408
My presence there is a joke.

174
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:17,615
l am supposed to help
these colonies function

175
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:20,021
under the terms
of the new treaty.

176
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:22,788
Now, Ben, what the hell
does that mean?

177
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:25,227
l thought these colonists
wanted to stay.

178
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:26,821
That they refused to evacuate.

179
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:28,958
The treaty gave away
their territory

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,228
to the Cardassians--

181
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:33,635
territory that these people
had invested their lives in.

182
00:09:33,671 --> 00:09:35,605
Now, Ben, if you knew them
as l do

183
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,665
you'd know why they can't leave.

184
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:38,869
lt's a bad treaty.

185
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,037
The Federation
gave away too much.

186
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,376
Several Cardassian colonies

187
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:45,576
wanted to stay on the Federation
side of the zone, too.

188
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:48,085
lt seemed like
a reasonable compromise.

189
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,848
Oh, yes,
the Cardassians would love

190
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:52,482
to have their colonies
in our territory

191
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:54,822
because they know
we'd protect them

192
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:57,919
but they have no intention
of doing the same for ours.

193
00:09:57,962 --> 00:10:00,954
A number of Admirals
at Starfleet Command are worried

194
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:03,832
the destruction of the <i>Bok'Nor</i>
might jeopardize the treaty.

195
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:05,028
Oh, are they really?

196
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:08,232
As the two ranking officers
along the Cardassian border

197
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:11,208
we've been asked to assess
the potential risk.

198
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:13,005
There is no risk, Ben.

199
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:15,012
None.

200
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:17,105
l have been dealing
with the Cardassians

201
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:19,581
most of my professional life,
and believe me

202
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:22,677
they are very pleased with
what they got from the treaty.

203
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,245
They are not about
to risk losing

204
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,124
all they've gained
by sending forces into the zone.

205
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,594
They're much too slick for that.

206
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:35,429
lf l were you, l'd be
very concerned with security

207
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:37,627
along the Bajoran border.

208
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:44,130
Are you surprised they haven't
responded at all yet?

209
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:46,369
Well, Ben, you and l both know

210
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:49,642
they never let you see
what you expect to see.

211
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,979
They'll respond.

212
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:10,025
Quarters have been arranged
through discreet channels--

213
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:11,558
Deck 7, Section 4-G.

214
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:15,266
l suggest you keep a low profile
until your ship arrives.

215
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,091
Can l get you something?

216
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,930
You are Quark, aren't you?

217
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,904
l assure you,
the warrant is out of date.

218
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,667
l cleared that matter up
months ago.

219
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,572
Warrant?

220
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:51,100
Oh, uh, when you recognized me,
l assumed...

221
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,975
You are counting your receipts.

222
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,503
lt is logical to conclude

223
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,108
you are the proprietor
of the establishment.

224
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,481
You're very observant.

225
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,849
What can l do for you?

226
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,685
l was hoping to discuss
a business proposition.

227
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,054
With me?

228
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,251
Uh, perhaps l should explain
about that slip of the tongue.

229
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,285
Your past
is of no consequence to me.

230
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,160
l'm delighted
to hear you say that

231
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,166
because nothing
would please me more

232
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,169
than to make a fresh start
with the Vulcans, Ms., uh...?

233
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,229
-Sakonna.
-Sakonna.

234
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:20,900
Such a handsome name

235
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,501
for such a handsome young woman.

236
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,773
What will you have to drink?

237
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:26,972
Wait a minute.

238
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,914
l have just the thing.

239
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,679
Vulcan port.

240
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,878
Three centuries old.

241
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:38,380
Very rare, very expensive.

242
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,551
Shall l pour you a glass?

243
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,560
No.

244
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,323
Not even a taste?
lt's exquisite.

245
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,329
l'm not thirsty

246
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,092
thus, l see no reason
to have a drink.

247
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:48,795
Well, it'll be right here
should you develop a thirst.

248
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,998
Now, uh, you mentioned
a business proposition.

249
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,301
lt is a private matter.

250
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,308
l would rather not
discuss it here.

251
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,207
Then we can discuss
it over dinner.

252
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,439
That is, we can plan
the business meeting

253
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,312
to coincide with when you think
you might get hungry.

254
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,714
That would be acceptable.

255
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,047
That would be wonderful.

256
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,916
How does 8:00
sound to your tummy?

257
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,081
l will return then.

258
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,487
And, by the way

259
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:21,161
l'd love to melt
that cold Vulcan heart of yours.

260
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,132
Bleech.

261
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,172
Oh!

262
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,009
Oh, here, allow me.

263
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,072
Thank you.

264
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:39,482
Ah! Oh...

265
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,528
Jake-o?

266
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:53,226
Your son is not here,
Commander.

267
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,528
Dukat.

268
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,763
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to startle you.

269
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,100
Where is he?

270
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,536
Who? Your son?

271
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,370
How would l know?

272
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:02,500
l just...

273
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,340
Commander, you don't...?

274
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:13,047
Do you think l would ever
do anything to harm your son?

275
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,054
l think
you're capable of anything.

276
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,919
You wound me, sir.

277
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19,425
l'm here as your friend.

278
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,721
Sisko to Kira.

279
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:24,060
Please do not do anything
hastily, Commander.

280
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,587
We must talk in private.

281
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,929
Yes, Commander?

282
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,992
Major, l want you to find Jake.

283
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,230
ls he missing?

284
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,237
l don't know.

285
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,898
Find out where he is
and let me know.

286
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:33,928
Understood.

287
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,172
How the hell
did you get in here?

288
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,075
l was an unregistered passenger

289
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:42,081
on a Kotakian ship
that docked here this morning.

290
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,276
l slipped in
through the cargo bay.

291
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:49,254
Hmm. And made your way here
without anyone seeing you.

292
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,655
l was the Commander
of this station

293
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,488
for almost ten years.

294
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:56,519
When one knows
the various corridors

295
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,191
and passageways as well as l...

296
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,029
Oh, by the way, l love

297
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:04,037
what you've done
with these quarters.

298
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,129
Kira to Sisko.

299
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,264
Jake's fine, Commander.

300
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,501
He's with Nog,
watching the women

301
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,874
coming off the Bajoran transport
at Docking Bay 1.

302
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,038
Shall l have him
brought to your quarters?

303
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,479
No, that's all right.

304
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,776
Thank you, Major.

305
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:17,977
Sisko out.

306
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,009
There. You see?

307
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,783
Safe and sound.

308
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,424
What are you doing here?

309
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,657
You have a problem.

310
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:33,757
Do l?

311
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,028
The <i>Bok'Nor?.</i>

312
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,502
ls this the Cardassian
Central Command's way

313
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,562
of responding to my communiqués?

314
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,597
On the contrary.

315
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,768
Central Command
has no idea l'm here.

316
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,675
lt's true.

317
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,202
l'm here unofficially

318
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,614
to help you find out
the truth about the <i>Bok'Nor.</i>

319
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,242
Why would you want to help me?

320
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,776
Because l already know
the truth.

321
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,083
Do you know who's responsible?

322
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,315
-l do.
-Who?

323
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,654
You are.

324
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,729
Well, not you personally,
Commander.

325
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,561
l know you to be
an honorable man.

326
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,125
You're not one to sneak around

327
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:13,037
attaching implosion devices
to impulse engines.

328
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,005
But believe it or not

329
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:19,137
there are those of your brethren
who are willing

330
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,976
to do such things.

331
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,516
Morally superior human beings

332
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:30,011
and other members
of the Federation.

333
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,992
l'm supposed
to take your word for that?

334
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,426
Of course not.

335
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,589
lt's my job to convince you

336
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,361
so you can clean up
your own house

337
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,460
instead of forcing us
to do it for you

338
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:47,234
which would certainly
endanger the new treaty.

339
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,936
We'll need
one of your runabouts.

340
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,773
Where are we going?

341
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,472
The Volon colonies.

342
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,504
The Demilitarized Zone?

343
00:16:55,549 --> 00:17:00,953
Hmm. Not so demilitarized,
l'm afraid.

344
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,427
l can't help but notice

345
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,794
that my controls
are not illuminated.

346
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,856
lsn't it customary
for both seats

347
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,733
to be turned on, so that
l may pilot the craft

348
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,567
in the event of an emergency?

349
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:21,870
lf there's an emergency,
l guess you're out of luck.

350
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,138
Commander, l'm not
going to sit here

351
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,645
and steal
your little technical secrets

352
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,147
l promise you.

353
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,739
l appreciate your assurances

354
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:33,241
but Cardassians are famous
for their photographic memories.

355
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,049
Oh, so you turn off my controls

356
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,679
so l don't have enough light

357
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,691
to take my photograph,
is that it?

358
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,989
l've heard they put
Cardassian children

359
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,927
in intense
mind training programs

360
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,555
when they're four years old.

361
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:45,656
ls that true?

362
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:48,065
The Cardassian
educational system

363
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,227
is unparalleled
in the quadrant.

364
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,569
lf you don't mind taking
the joy out of growing up.

365
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:55,302
Education is power.

366
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,708
Joy is vulnerability.

367
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,870
What?

368
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,608
Your reaction
surprises me, Commander.

369
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,878
l thought you
would understand.

370
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,817
Of all the humans l've met

371
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,252
you strike me
as the most joyless

372
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,017
and the least vulnerable.

373
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,784
l am when l'm with you.

374
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,560
Well said.

375
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,529
But, in truth,
l'm looking forward

376
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,226
to getting to know you
better on this journey.

377
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,565
l think we know each other
well enough.

378
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:26,433
ls that a ramscoop control

379
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:28,227
or a deflector grid panel?

380
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,867
Just curious.

381
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:33,736
lt really doesn't matter.

382
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:37,732
Cardassian pursuit vessels
are years ahead of this design.

383
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:40,005
What is it?

384
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,173
Long-range sensors
are picking up

385
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:43,477
a distress signal.

386
00:18:43,517 --> 00:18:44,643
From who?

387
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:47,983
A Federation merchant vessel
under attack

388
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:48,988
by Cardassians.

389
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:54,955
l'm reading
two Cardassian attack vessels

390
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:57,395
just inside
the Demilitarized Zone.

391
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,761
That's not possible.

392
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,097
l promise you, Commander,
we would not violate the treaty.

393
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:04,933
The merchant vessel's
com links are down.

394
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:06,370
l can't raise them.

395
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:10,206
Computer, fix source coordinates
of the distress signal

396
00:19:10,243 --> 00:19:12,768
and lay in a new course--
warp 3.

397
00:19:12,812 --> 00:19:14,336
l hope you don't mind.

398
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:15,507
Not at all.

399
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:18,916
l'm as curious about this
as you are.

400
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:25,015
What type of Cardassian
ships are they?

401
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:26,650
Patrol cruisers?

402
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:27,660
No, much smaller.

403
00:19:27,694 --> 00:19:28,752
They look like shuttlecraft.

404
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:29,819
Cardassian shuttles

405
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:31,455
attacking a Federation
merchant ship?

406
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:35,025
They seem to be armed
with Galor-class phaser banks.

407
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:36,330
They must be from

408
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:39,133
Cardassian colonies
in the Demilitarized Zone.

409
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:40,434
Hail them.

410
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:43,408
-No response.
-Open a channel.

411
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:45,274
Go ahead.

412
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:48,839
To the pilots of the Cardassian
attack vessels.

413
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:52,682
This is Gul Dukat,
Commander of the Second Order.

414
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,913
Please respond.

415
00:19:57,557 --> 00:20:02,620
This is Gul Dukat, security
identification: A-D-L 4-Zero.

416
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:07,429
l order you to immediately
disengage your attack.

417
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,070
We're still two minutes away.

418
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:15,268
The Federation vessel's shields
are down to 40 percent.

419
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:17,242
Hail those
Cardassians again.

420
00:20:17,277 --> 00:20:20,508
l don't know who you are
or where you come from

421
00:20:20,547 --> 00:20:23,243
but you're going to pay
for this, l promise you.

422
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:26,252
Answer me immediately,
or l personally will fire

423
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:28,447
the photons
that will destroy you.

424
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:33,048
Arm the photons.

425
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:35,587
The photon launcher is...

426
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:36,721
l know.

427
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:39,732
l knew all about these controls
before l ever came on board.

428
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:41,597
Tell me when we're
in torpedo range.

429
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:42,932
Stand by.

430
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:45,802
l'm picking up another ship
moving toward them.

431
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,105
That's a Federation signature,
l believe, Commander.

432
00:20:50,143 --> 00:20:51,872
lt sure isn't from Starfleet.

433
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:55,108
l've never seen a ship
configuration like that before.

434
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:57,683
lt almost seems
like someone has modified

435
00:20:57,717 --> 00:20:59,116
an old support courier.

436
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:00,413
Hmm.

437
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:02,944
Hailing them.

438
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:04,718
No response.

439
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:08,051
They fired torpedoes.

440
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:11,029
What kind of civilian
vessel that size

441
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:13,032
would be carrying photon?

442
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:16,524
Something from one
of your colonies, perhaps?

443
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:24,202
Now do you begin to see,
Commander

444
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:27,611
that without any help
from either one of us

445
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:31,879
they've managed to start
their own little war out here?

446
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:45,362
l hope you're hungry.

447
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:47,764
l've planned
a wonderful meal for us

448
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:49,325
starting with <i>plomeek</i> soup

449
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:51,633
which l know is
a traditional Vulcan favorite

450
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:56,335
followed by jumbo
Romulan mollusks.

451
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:59,106
You can't get those back
on Vulcan anymore, can you?

452
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:01,476
Do you eat in this grand
a manner every night?

453
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:03,448
Certainly not; this
is a special occasion.

454
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:04,541
lt is?

455
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,984
The commencement
of a new business relationship

456
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,386
is the most special
occasion for any Ferengi.

457
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:12,823
lt's a cause for opening
great bottles of wine

458
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:17,228
dancing into the wee,
small hours of the morning.

459
00:22:17,263 --> 00:22:19,060
We'll let it breathe
for a few minutes.

460
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:21,633
Very well;
l will attempt to respect

461
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:24,262
some of your cultural
idiosyncrasies.

462
00:22:24,304 --> 00:22:28,070
l will drink the wine,
but l won't dance.

463
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:31,507
Maybe you'll change your mind
after you drink the wine.

464
00:22:31,544 --> 00:22:33,068
No, l won't.

465
00:22:33,113 --> 00:22:34,705
Oh, come on.

466
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:38,912
Somewhere inside that cool,
controlled exterior of yours

467
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:42,945
there is a wild woman
screaming to get out.

468
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:44,286
Maybe by the end of the night

469
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:46,019
you'll be dancing
on the table tops.

470
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:48,425
Maybe not.

471
00:22:48,461 --> 00:22:52,693
ls it appropriate to begin
our business discussion now?

472
00:22:52,732 --> 00:22:54,927
Rule of Acquisition
Number 214:

473
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:56,868
Never begin
a business negotiation

474
00:22:56,903 --> 00:22:58,063
on an empty stomach.

475
00:22:58,104 --> 00:22:59,696
Rule of Acquisition?

476
00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:01,229
Yes.

477
00:23:01,274 --> 00:23:03,708
Every Ferengi
business transaction

478
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:06,769
is governed
by 285 Rules of Acquisition

479
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:11,250
to ensure a fair and honest deal
for all parties concerned.

480
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:13,343
Well, most of them, anyway.

481
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:16,014
Commendable-- to create
a code of behavior

482
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:17,852
for business transactions...

483
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:19,256
ls logical.

484
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:21,283
And quite reassuring.

485
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:23,386
Do Vulcans have
anything similar?

486
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:27,058
ln structure, it reminds one
of the Vulcan Bill of Rights

487
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,331
which guarantees the fundamental
personal freedoms

488
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,928
of every Vulcan citizen.

489
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:33,529
Same thing exactly.

490
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:35,438
May l propose a toast?

491
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:38,603
ls this another
cultural idiosyncrasy?

492
00:23:38,645 --> 00:23:41,079
Yes. You know, l can't describe

493
00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:44,082
the honor l feel at this moment.

494
00:23:44,117 --> 00:23:47,553
lt's rare that a Ferengi
and a Vulcan

495
00:23:47,587 --> 00:23:49,384
can overcome
their inherent differences

496
00:23:49,422 --> 00:23:51,014
to see eye-to-eye
as we are doing.

497
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:53,457
l've always had
the greatest respect

498
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:57,259
for Vulcans, even though
the few l've met

499
00:23:57,297 --> 00:23:59,993
haven't exactly felt
the same way about me.

500
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:02,228
You're a noble people...

501
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:04,668
and l salute you.

502
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,909
Now then, what kind
of business proposition

503
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:20,044
do you have in mind?

504
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,984
l wish to procure weapons.

505
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:25,047
l beg your pardon?

506
00:24:25,124 --> 00:24:27,058
Guns, phaser banks,
photon torpedoes...

507
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:29,425
-Shh.
-...troop transports

508
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:31,657
and a number
of cobalt-thorium devices.

509
00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:33,325
My list is quite extensive.

510
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:35,459
You're a gun runner?

511
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:37,469
l am prepared
to pay in latinum

512
00:24:37,503 --> 00:24:40,563
and l will very likely need
a continuous supply

513
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:42,336
for the foreseeable future.

514
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:48,770
You're not like other Vulcans,
are you?

515
00:24:56,356 --> 00:24:59,291
The Federation merchant ship
refused to be boarded!

516
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,759
So your ships
just decided to open fire?

517
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:04,285
lt was clear the Federation ship
was carrying weapons

518
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,321
through the Demilitarized Zone.

519
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:08,630
That ship was carrying
medical supplies to Saltok lV.

520
00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:11,034
Ben, what are you doing here?

521
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:12,401
l'm not sure yet.

522
00:25:12,438 --> 00:25:14,906
Gul Dukat asked me
to accompany him.

523
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:16,033
Dukat--

524
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:18,168
no one informed us
you were coming.

525
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:21,806
l decided an impromptu visit
would be preferable

526
00:25:21,848 --> 00:25:25,841
so you wouldn't be bothered
with special preparations.

527
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:26,852
l see.

528
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:28,854
Commander Sisko, you know

529
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:32,410
my counterpart
from the colonies, Gul Evek.

530
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:34,568
l'm glad you're here
to listen to this, Commander.

531
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:37,046
We monitored the attack
on the way in.

532
00:25:37,114 --> 00:25:39,241
Yes, ''monitor''
is the proper word

533
00:25:39,283 --> 00:25:42,719
because none of the ships
would respond to our hails.

534
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:46,189
Even the Cardassian pilots
refused to acknowledge me.

535
00:25:46,224 --> 00:25:48,590
A strange voice
from a Federation runabout.

536
00:25:48,626 --> 00:25:51,686
l gave them
my security identification.

537
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:54,061
Well, obviously,
they had their hands full.

538
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:55,793
With an unprovoked attack.

539
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,232
Unprovoked, was it?

540
00:25:57,268 --> 00:26:00,066
Do you deny that
the Federation is engaging

541
00:26:00,137 --> 00:26:02,298
in organized
terrorist activities

542
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,898
against the Cardassian people

543
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:06,409
deliberately undermining
this treaty?

544
00:26:06,444 --> 00:26:09,004
The Federation does not conduct
secret wars.

545
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,274
Then perhaps you can explain

546
00:26:10,314 --> 00:26:11,804
where the Federation ship
came from--

547
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:13,544
the one outfitted
with photon torpedoes.

548
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:14,983
Explain why your ships
were armed

549
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,782
with Galor-class phaser banks.

550
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:18,584
They have a right
to defend themselves

551
00:26:18,623 --> 00:26:20,454
against organized
terrorist activities.

552
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:22,118
l haven't heard any proof yet

553
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,024
of organized
terrorist activities.

554
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:25,494
Because there is none.

555
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,020
On the contrary.

556
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:30,033
We have the confession
of the Federation terrorist

557
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:32,797
responsible for the destruction
of the <i>Bok'Nor</i>

558
00:26:32,837 --> 00:26:34,395
at your station, Commander.

559
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:36,463
Confession?

560
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:41,910
A 43-year-old male human,
William Patrick Samuels

561
00:26:41,946 --> 00:26:44,676
born Bergen, Norway, Earth...

562
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:46,307
We know who he is.

563
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,784
What have you done with him?

564
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:51,617
Came to the Federation colony
on Volon ll 20 years ago.

565
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:53,954
Married, wife's name Louise,
two female children

566
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:56,357
aged 14 and 12.

567
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:57,520
He was quite cooperative

568
00:26:57,562 --> 00:26:59,462
once we apprehended
him on Deep Space 9.

569
00:27:07,939 --> 00:27:09,463
Begin.

570
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:11,600
My name is William Samuels.

571
00:27:11,642 --> 00:27:16,204
l am being held for crimes
against the Cardassian people.

572
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:18,340
l have been well-treated.

573
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,249
l have confessed

574
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:24,482
that as a member of a well-armed
anti-Cardassian force

575
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,956
organized
by Federation colonists

576
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:30,256
l set an implosion device

577
00:27:30,294 --> 00:27:33,024
that destroyed
the freighter <i>Bok'Nor.</i>

578
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:36,522
l deeply regret participating
in this arbitrary attack

579
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:39,798
that led to the deaths
of over 7 5 crewmen.

580
00:27:39,837 --> 00:27:45,002
To my wife and children...
l'm sorry

581
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:48,569
and... l love you.

582
00:27:52,383 --> 00:27:54,544
He would have
confessed to anything

583
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:56,678
after you were through with him.

584
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:57,779
On the contrary.

585
00:27:57,822 --> 00:27:59,483
He confessed quite early

586
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:01,650
in the interrogation
procedure--

587
00:28:01,692 --> 00:28:03,660
far sooner than we expected.

588
00:28:03,694 --> 00:28:05,992
l believe he truly felt remorse.

589
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,964
We want to talk
to him ourselves.

590
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:09,626
Bring him in.

591
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:13,831
Unfortunately, he committed
suicide in his cell.

592
00:28:26,684 --> 00:28:27,708
Come on, come on!

593
00:28:27,752 --> 00:28:28,719
lt's all right!

594
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:30,516
Dukat, get them out of here!

595
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:34,815
Go on, we'll talk later.

596
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:37,259
We can't let them
get away with this.

597
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:39,194
We'll talk later.
You go on!

598
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,391
Get him out of here.

599
00:28:58,449 --> 00:29:02,215
l knew him.

600
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:05,620
Bill Samuels was a farmer.

601
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:10,389
He cultivated his land
for 20 years.

602
00:29:10,428 --> 00:29:13,886
He raised two children
on that land.

603
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:17,890
He made something
out of that land

604
00:29:17,935 --> 00:29:20,335
and the Federation told him

605
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:24,398
he had to give it all
up to the Cardassians.

606
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:27,605
Well, he just was not
willing to do that.

607
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:30,205
And it was people like him
who made both sides realize

608
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:33,944
that some accommodation had
to be made for the colonies

609
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:35,474
so they could stay.

610
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,113
The Cardassians
have no intention

611
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:40,749
of allowing these
people to stay.

612
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:45,251
They will either force them out
or they will kill them.

613
00:29:45,296 --> 00:29:47,594
lt's already started.

614
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:48,825
Not a day goes by

615
00:29:48,866 --> 00:29:51,562
when there's not some
random act of violence

616
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:52,796
against our people.

617
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:54,168
Every Federation colonist knows

618
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:57,697
you do not go out alone
at night.

619
00:29:57,742 --> 00:30:00,336
Can you imagine living
under that kind of fear?

620
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:02,743
lf you're saying
the Cardassian authorities

621
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,179
are not enforcing the laws...

622
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:05,182
Enforcing the laws?

623
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:06,911
The Cardassian authorities

624
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:09,818
were part of a mob that
stoned two colonists

625
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:12,755
on the streets of Ropal City
three days ago.

626
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,691
That's something the Federation
can take up with the Cardassians

627
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:16,750
at the highest levels.

628
00:30:16,794 --> 00:30:18,591
Well, that will help a lot.

629
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,263
The word is
the Cardassian High Command

630
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,633
is arming their colonists
to the teeth.

631
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,194
You really think they'd risk

632
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:30,400
sending weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone

633
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:31,908
and breaking the treaty?

634
00:30:31,942 --> 00:30:35,275
l think they'll find
a way to do it

635
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:37,473
that's not so obvious.

636
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:41,713
Not long ago, we caught
the Cardassians shipping weapons

637
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:46,086
to Bajoran extremists through
a third party, the Yridians.

638
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,021
That sounds about right.

639
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:51,653
Would the <i>Bok'Nor</i> have been
transferring weapons

640
00:30:51,695 --> 00:30:54,095
to someone else
to bring in here?

641
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:57,191
lf it was,
then the transfer was made

642
00:30:57,234 --> 00:30:59,293
before the ship
reached the station.

643
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:02,601
The cargo holds
of the <i>Bok'Nor</i> were empty.

644
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,733
Do you think he did it?

645
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:07,141
Samuels?

646
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:11,444
l don't know.

647
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:15,043
They could have forced him
to make a false confession

648
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,518
and then killed him.

649
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:18,681
l don't think Gul Dukat
would drag me all the way here

650
00:31:18,722 --> 00:31:20,952
unless he knew
he could prove it.

651
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:23,118
Well, maybe he did do it, Ben.
l don't know.

652
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,621
Damn!

653
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:31,464
l've got to go see his wife.

654
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:35,495
l don't know
what l'm going to tell her.

655
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:41,403
lt makes you pine for
the good old, dull days

656
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:43,538
in New Berlin, doesn't it?

657
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:45,446
Sausage and beer all around

658
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,814
and everyone's idea
of a good time

659
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:50,821
was the mazurka festival.

660
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:54,689
Gretchen and Jennifer had a ball
there together, didn't they?

661
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:58,821
l'll never forget the sight
of you in those lederhosen.

662
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:02,856
l still have the hat.

663
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:08,129
ls there something larger
going on here, Cal?

664
00:32:08,172 --> 00:32:14,372
Are these colonists organizing
some kind of terrorist campaign?

665
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:15,776
Well, if they are

666
00:32:15,813 --> 00:32:18,873
they're not about
to tell me about it.

667
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,850
But l'll tell you one thing,
Ben.

668
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:21,977
Between you and me

669
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:25,386
those people have every right
to defend themselves.

670
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:28,721
When the Federation
said good-bye to them

671
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:31,467
they left them no other choice.

672
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:46,882
You're very quiet, Commander.

673
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:50,716
You knew about Samuels
before we left.

674
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:53,620
l knew about his confession,
yes.

675
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:55,487
l didn't know he was...

676
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:59,858
l was as surprised
as you were by his death.

677
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:04,332
No one is going to buy
your suicide story.

678
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,834
l don't care what he did.

679
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:09,497
This kind of barbaric disregard
for life

680
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:10,971
will gut this treaty.

681
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:14,237
lf it means anything,
l entirely agree.

682
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:18,679
l told Evek he was a fool
to let Samuels die.

683
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:22,206
A good interrogator doesn't
allow his subject to die.

684
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,843
You lose the advantage.

685
00:33:23,886 --> 00:33:25,820
That's all
you're interested in, isn't it?

686
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:26,946
The advantage.

687
00:33:26,989 --> 00:33:29,924
Oh, now, don't go spouting off

688
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:34,692
your holier-than-thou
Federation fair play dogma.

689
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,826
And lest we forget,
your man was responsible

690
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:41,734
for the deaths
of 78 innocent crewmen.

691
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,863
What was the <i>Bok'Nor</i>
transporting?

692
00:33:43,906 --> 00:33:46,306
The <i>Bok'Nor</i> had just delivered

693
00:33:46,342 --> 00:33:49,175
14 metric tons of golside ore
to the Regulon system

694
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:51,270
prior to its arrival
at the wormhole.

695
00:33:51,313 --> 00:33:53,042
You're sure
it wasn't carrying weapons?

696
00:33:53,148 --> 00:33:55,048
Weapons? To whom?

697
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,813
To the Cardassians
in the Demilitarized Zone.

698
00:33:57,853 --> 00:33:59,548
No, the route of the <i>Bok'Nor</i>

699
00:33:59,588 --> 00:34:02,716
didn't take it anywhere near
the Demilitarized Zone.

700
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:04,726
lt could have rendezvoused
with someone else--

701
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,920
with the Lissepians, maybe.

702
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,986
They could have transferred
the weapons to them

703
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:09,928
and they could have taken
the weapons to...

704
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:10,932
Commander!

705
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,695
l know you'd love to find

706
00:34:12,735 --> 00:34:15,431
some justification
for this mass murder

707
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,803
to ease
your Federation conscience

708
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,675
but if the <i>Bok'Nor</i> was carrying
weapons, l would know.

709
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:28,149
And on the lives of my children,
l swear to you it was not.

710
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:32,687
l didn't know you had children.

711
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:35,212
Seven.

712
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,139
l received your message.

713
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,769
How soon will it be available?

714
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,280
My source can have
everything ready tomorrow.

715
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:00,303
Say by 1400 hours.

716
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:01,839
That's not soon enough.

717
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:03,249
l must leave
the station tonight.

718
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:04,309
You're leaving so soon?

719
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:05,786
My plans have changed.

720
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:08,813
Can your source have the
materials ready by tonight?

721
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,324
l guess he'll have to.

722
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,487
l have your latinum,
if you'd like to count it.

723
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,156
Are you trustworthy?

724
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,994
l'm a Vulcan.

725
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:18,158
Of course.

726
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,326
Just a little joke.

727
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:20,835
l'm sure it's all there.

728
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,302
Well, it wouldn't hurt

729
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:24,669
to give it a quick
count, l suppose.

730
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:27,335
l will have it brought
to your quarters.

731
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:31,005
l was looking forward
to showing you more ways

732
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:33,513
to mix business with pleasure.

733
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,847
Perhaps in the future.

734
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:40,378
l do find you...
intriguing, Quark.

735
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,583
''lntriguing.''

736
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:50,161
You can stay in the guest suite
on Level H-2

737
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:52,599
while you arrange transport
back to Cardassia.

738
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:54,829
l'll have a security guard
meet you there.

739
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,464
Starfleet security,
if you don't mind, Commander.

740
00:35:57,506 --> 00:36:00,031
Some of the Bajoran deputies
are still around

741
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:02,134
from the good old days
when l was in charge.

742
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:03,201
l understand.

743
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,803
lf there's anything else
l can do

744
00:36:04,847 --> 00:36:06,678
to assist you in
your investigation...

745
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:08,512
l think l can
handle it from here.

746
00:36:14,556 --> 00:36:15,818
Chief?

747
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:16,882
Yes, sir.

748
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,153
l've got answers for you

749
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:20,559
but l'm not sure
you're going to like them.

750
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:21,995
lt was an implosive device.

751
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,724
Yes, sir.
And not only that...

752
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:26,496
Not only that, it was
a Federation implosive device.

753
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:29,265
Yes, sir. The traces
of mercassium we found

754
00:36:29,304 --> 00:36:31,898
were from the casing
of the device itself.

755
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,999
lt had to be
a Federation design.

756
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:37,034
Get me Starfleet Command
on subspace.

757
00:36:46,388 --> 00:36:50,119
Commander, is there anything
you'd like me to communicate

758
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:52,127
to the provisional
government?

759
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:55,028
Tell them some reckless colonist
in the Demilitarized Zone

760
00:36:55,097 --> 00:36:56,121
blew up the <i>Bok'Nor.</i>

761
00:36:56,165 --> 00:36:58,633
There's no further threat
of Cardassian reprisals

762
00:36:58,667 --> 00:36:59,861
to Bajor.

763
00:36:59,902 --> 00:37:02,336
l'll advise all of our outposts
to stand down.

764
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:08,742
Sir, are... are we facing
the prospect of war here?

765
00:37:08,777 --> 00:37:10,301
Not if l can help it.

766
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:12,108
But that's what
the colonists are after.

767
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,638
l don't think they know
what they're after, Major.

768
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:15,980
l just know
they have to be stopped

769
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:17,780
and it's Starfleet's job
to stop them.

770
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,310
Sir, l know this is
none of my business...

771
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:20,981
But you're going to give
me your opinion anyway.

772
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:22,647
l don't know
what the Cardassians told you.

773
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:25,524
They played a confession
of the man who planted the bomb.

774
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:27,586
A man they most likely
tortured to death.

775
00:37:27,629 --> 00:37:29,927
And you don't think you might
be playing into their hands?

776
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:32,456
l've got people out there
killing people, Major.

777
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,991
You suggest l turn
a blind eye to that?

778
00:37:34,102 --> 00:37:35,831
They don't have a right
to defend themselves?

779
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:36,895
They've crossed the line!

780
00:37:36,939 --> 00:37:38,998
lf Starfleet is unwilling
to defend their people...

781
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:40,701
They chose to live
with the Cardassians!

782
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:41,766
Well, l didn't!

783
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,573
But l lived with them
for 26 years

784
00:37:43,612 --> 00:37:45,011
before the liberation came.

785
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:47,377
Every Bajoran lived with them
in constant fear.

786
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:49,646
l know what those colonists
are going through.

787
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,915
Most of all, l know

788
00:37:51,954 --> 00:37:53,785
that the Cardassians
can't be trusted

789
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:56,313
to keep their side
of the bargain in this treaty.

790
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,916
So, you'd suggest the Federation

791
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,928
not keep our side
of the bargain either--

792
00:37:59,962 --> 00:38:01,589
perhaps by arming
these colonists?

793
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,463
l can tell you
one thing for certain.

794
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:08,128
The Cardassians are the enemy,
not your own colonists

795
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,899
and if Starfleet
can't understand that

796
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:11,701
then the Federation
is even more naive

797
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,071
than l already think it is.

798
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:24,245
l've been sent to relieve you.

799
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:25,810
There must be some mistake.

800
00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:27,913
l just reported for duty
an hour...

801
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:35,496
Yes?

802
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,622
Sorry to disturb you, sir

803
00:38:36,665 --> 00:38:38,860
but there's a message here
from Commander Sisko.

804
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:44,167
We have been asked to escort you
to Airlock 1 1, sir.

805
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:46,174
A Cardassian freighter
has just arrived.

806
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:47,368
ls there a problem?

807
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,037
Apparently, another bomb
has been found and disarmed.

808
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:05,355
Where's Commander Sisko?

809
00:39:05,394 --> 00:39:08,227
Comfortably asleep
in his quarters, l hope.

810
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:12,692
Remember me?

811
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:15,965
l take it
we're not about to board

812
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:18,232
a Cardassian freighter.

813
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:46,949
What do you think
they're telling him?

814
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,816
With two kidnappings
and a ship exploding

815
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:49,844
in the course of a week

816
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,686
l'm sure they've got
a few things to say.

817
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:52,691
lt's their own fault.

818
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:54,784
l've been warning them
since the beginning.

819
00:39:54,828 --> 00:39:57,888
What are you talking about--
their fault?

820
00:39:57,931 --> 00:39:59,762
You're in charge of security.

821
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:02,791
lf you will let me be
in charge of security

822
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:05,327
l will give you a safe station.

823
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:07,737
You people tell me to do my job

824
00:40:07,774 --> 00:40:09,674
then give me a
Federation rule book

825
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:11,643
listing all the things
l can't do.

826
00:40:11,678 --> 00:40:13,145
Untie my hands

827
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:15,409
before you start
to blame me, Mr. O'Brien.

828
00:40:15,448 --> 00:40:17,780
l'm sure no one meant
to blame you, Odo.

829
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,478
Give me the right
to set a curfew.

830
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,885
Let me do more searches
of arriving passengers.

831
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:23,354
Give me 50 more deputies.

832
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:25,949
And this station will be
just the way it was

833
00:40:25,992 --> 00:40:27,289
during the occupation.

834
00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:28,794
Say what you like.

835
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:30,295
lt was safer then.

836
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,355
Unless you happened
to be a Bajoran.

837
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:34,895
l want a complete review

838
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:37,459
of all security measures
on board this station.

839
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:38,869
l'll be delighted
to accommodate you.

840
00:40:38,905 --> 00:40:40,463
What do we have from the guard?

841
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:43,567
He's given us a description
of the two who assaulted him--

842
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,975
A Vulcan female
and a human male

843
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:46,706
in a Starfleet officer's
uniform.

844
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:49,374
We're trying to locate anyone
they might have contacted here.

845
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:51,383
How many ships left the station
during the night?

846
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:52,611
Only two, sir.

847
00:40:52,652 --> 00:40:54,381
The Bardeezan merchant ship
and a Galador freighter.

848
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,944
What were their destinations?

849
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:58,116
The Bardeezans went
through the wormhole.

850
00:40:58,158 --> 00:41:00,149
The freighter is operating
on a trade route

851
00:41:00,193 --> 00:41:02,457
between Galador ll
and Farius Prime.

852
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:04,087
l'm guessing these people

853
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,758
wouldn't take Dukat
through the wormhole.

854
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:10,132
They'd head back to the
Demilitarized Zone with him.

855
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,104
Dax, check the Galador
ship's registry

856
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,571
and make sure it's in order.

857
00:41:13,606 --> 00:41:14,630
Chief, see if you

858
00:41:14,674 --> 00:41:17,074
can identify its warp signature
from our sensor records.

859
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,668
No problem, Commander.

860
00:41:18,711 --> 00:41:19,678
l've got it.

861
00:41:19,712 --> 00:41:21,907
Last known course.

862
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:26,282
The computer's showing it was
on a bearing 216 mark 177.

863
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,616
As it left our sensor range

864
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:29,451
it was still heading
for Farius Prime.

865
00:41:30,857 --> 00:41:34,122
Major, send a message
to Farius Prime.

866
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,889
lf that ship shows up,
and l doubt that it will

867
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:37,897
l want to know it right away.

868
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:40,126
l could send the warp signature
out over subspace.

869
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,929
You could make it
a general transmission.

870
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:43,959
lf it changes course,
someone should spot it.

871
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,129
Do it.

872
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,502
lt's a phony.

873
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:49,736
The Galadorans don't have
any ships in this sector.

874
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:51,107
The registry is forged.

875
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:53,669
Doctor, Major, you're with me.

876
00:41:53,713 --> 00:41:55,578
Odo, send a message
to Commander Hudson

877
00:41:55,615 --> 00:41:58,175
at the Volon colony that l'm
moving in his direction

878
00:41:58,218 --> 00:41:59,879
on the assumption
that Dukat will be taken

879
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:00,977
to the Demilitarized Zone.

880
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,612
Give him the warp signature
of the ship.

881
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:03,622
Aye, sir.

882
00:42:03,656 --> 00:42:07,456
Commander, we just received
a general subspace transmission

883
00:42:07,493 --> 00:42:09,586
from somewhere
in the Demilitarized Zone.

884
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:12,723
A group there is taking credit
for the kidnapping of Dukat.

885
00:42:12,765 --> 00:42:14,392
They're calling themselves...

886
00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:15,628
''the Maquis.''

887
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:32,544
Commander, a Klingon freighter

888
00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:35,076
two light-years
from the Demilitarized Zone

889
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:36,679
has lD'd the warp signature.

890
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:39,624
The ship did change course,
just as you predicted.

891
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:41,388
Transmit
their last known coordinates

892
00:42:41,427 --> 00:42:42,689
and heading to us, Chief.

893
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,127
Acknowledged.

894
00:42:45,164 --> 00:42:47,928
Let us know if anyone else
picks up their signature.

895
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:48,991
Aye, sir.

896
00:42:49,035 --> 00:42:50,093
O'Brien out.

897
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:51,398
Set a new course, Major.

898
00:42:51,437 --> 00:42:53,803
Yes, sir.

899
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,899
Their heading takes them
into the badlands.

900
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:57,000
Badlands?

901
00:42:57,043 --> 00:42:59,011
lt's a stretch
of the Cardassian border

902
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:00,010
ships try to avoid.

903
00:43:00,113 --> 00:43:01,910
A lot of plasma storms
in the area.

904
00:43:01,948 --> 00:43:05,577
A few ships have been lost there
in the past year or two.

905
00:43:05,618 --> 00:43:08,485
Sounds like the perfect place
for a hideout.

906
00:43:08,521 --> 00:43:09,852
Excuse me, sir.

907
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:12,881
What do you plan to do
if we catch up with them?

908
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:16,190
After all, these Maquis
are Federation colonists.

909
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:18,254
We're going
to get Gul Dukat back

910
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:19,856
by any means necessary.

911
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:23,630
Even if we have to fire
on our own people?

912
00:43:25,138 --> 00:43:28,767
Long-range sensors are picking
up the warp signature.

913
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:31,106
lt leads to an M-Class asteroid.

914
00:43:31,144 --> 00:43:32,634
Take us there.

915
00:43:41,821 --> 00:43:44,517
Scanning the surface.

916
00:43:44,557 --> 00:43:46,422
l've located the ship.

917
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:47,721
Those are human life signs.

918
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,318
ls there a Cardassian
among them?

919
00:43:49,362 --> 00:43:50,454
No, sir.

920
00:43:50,496 --> 00:43:52,430
Prepare to beam down.

921
00:44:14,787 --> 00:44:18,723
l'm glad to see you had
no trouble finding us, Ben.

922
00:44:18,758 --> 00:44:22,524
lt seems that one disaster
after another

923
00:44:22,562 --> 00:44:26,191
keeps bringing us
back together again.
