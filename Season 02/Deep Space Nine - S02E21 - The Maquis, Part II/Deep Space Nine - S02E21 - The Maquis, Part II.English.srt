1
00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:05,420
Last time on <i>Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:08,661
A number of Admirals
at Starfleet Command are worried

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,168
the destruction of the <i>Bok'nor</i>
might jeopardize the treaty.

4
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:12,498
Oh, are they really?

5
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:15,472
As the two ranking officers
along the Cardassian border

6
00:00:15,507 --> 00:00:18,374
we've been asked to assess
the potential risk.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,105
l wish to procure weapons.

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,170
l beg your pardon?

9
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:25,182
Guns, phaser banks,
photon torpedoes...

10
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:27,549
-Shh.
-...troop transports

11
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:30,487
and a number
of cobalt-thorium devices.

12
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:31,819
You're a gun runner?

13
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,188
l'm here unofficially

14
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:36,160
to help you find out
the truth about the <i>Bok'nor.</i>

15
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:37,661
Why would you want to help me?

16
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:39,926
Because l already know
the truth.

17
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:42,456
l've got people out there
killing people, Major.

18
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,059
You suggest l turn
a blind eye to that?

19
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:45,797
They don't have a right
to defend themselves?

20
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,963
They've crossed the line!

21
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,030
lf Starfleet is unwilling
to defend their people...

22
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:50,701
They chose to live
with the Cardassians!

23
00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:51,766
Well, l didn't!

24
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,573
But l lived with them
for 26 years

25
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:55,079
before the liberation came.

26
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:57,377
Every Bajoran lived with them
in constant fear.

27
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,680
l know what those colonists
are going through.

28
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:06,914
We just received
a general subspace transmission

29
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,619
from somewhere
in the Demilitarized Zone.

30
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,151
A group there is taking credit
for the kidnapping of Dukat.

31
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:13,060
They're calling themselves...

32
00:01:13,098 --> 00:01:15,032
''the Maquis.''

33
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,170
l'm glad to see you had
no trouble finding us, Ben.

34
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:26,540
lt seems that one disaster
after another

35
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:29,672
keeps bringing us
back together again.

36
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,240
And now, for the conclusion.

37
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:44,490
You should have seen
the look on your face

38
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:47,396
when you saw me
standing there, Ben.

39
00:01:47,432 --> 00:01:51,425
l hardly recognized you
without your uniform.

40
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,906
Well, it's been feeling
a little tight lately.

41
00:01:56,274 --> 00:01:57,741
Just like that.

42
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:59,710
lt's just a uniform, Ben.

43
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,372
ls that all it is?

44
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,540
l remember
when you first put it on.

45
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,551
Yes-- graduation day
at the Academy.

46
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:10,021
We both swore
that we'd be starship captains

47
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:12,421
by the time we were 30.

48
00:02:12,457 --> 00:02:14,482
And admirals by 40.

49
00:02:14,526 --> 00:02:15,857
Yes.

50
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:19,057
l think we've both done
pretty well for ourselves.

51
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,258
Yes, we have, haven't we?

52
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:24,268
But now,
l've got something better.

53
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:25,929
These settlers, Ben--

54
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:29,134
if you saw all they
have accomplished

55
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:32,166
without any help
from the Federation

56
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,075
then you'd fight
along with them.

57
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,104
l don't think so.

58
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,347
They've traveled out here
to the back of the beyond

59
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:46,584
and built homes
out of the wilderness.

60
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,752
Now, maybe the Federation
can turn their backs on them

61
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,022
but l can't.

62
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:51,187
l'm not asking you to

63
00:02:51,263 --> 00:02:53,959
but your joining the Maquis
isn't helping anyone.

64
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:56,467
Your actions have only
endangered the treaty

65
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:58,435
and put millions
of lives at risk.

66
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,995
The Federation believes
that it can solve

67
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,907
every problem with a treaty,
but out here, on the frontier

68
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:07,776
without the power of the
Federation to back them up

69
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,475
a treaty is only
a piece of paper.

70
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:11,641
Do you have evidence

71
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:14,516
that the Central Command
has violated the treaty?

72
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:15,918
Not yet, but we will.

73
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,251
lf you're depending

74
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:19,689
on Gul Dukat for proof,
you're going to be disappointed.

75
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:21,487
We'll find out, won't we?

76
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:23,687
l want him back, Cal.

77
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:25,662
He's not here.

78
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:27,824
Then where is he?

79
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:30,266
l never thought l'd see the day

80
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:34,363
when you'd side with a
Cardassian against me.

81
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:35,805
Damn it, Cal, l'm on your side.

82
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,832
You've got a funny way
of showing it, Ben.

83
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:39,275
l'm trying to stop you
from making

84
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,040
one of the biggest
mistakes of your life.

85
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,671
The Federation
believes in the treaty.

86
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:45,877
lf you destroy it,
Starfleet will come after you

87
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:49,080
and they won't be satisfied
until you're behind bars.

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,487
lf we work together
to end the violence...

89
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,652
The violence will never end
as long as Central Command

90
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,424
continues to smuggle weapons
to their colonies.

91
00:03:58,463 --> 00:04:01,330
l wish there were a better way
to handle this thing.

92
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,355
l really do.

93
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,028
Nobody wants peace
any more than the Maquis.

94
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,128
And you're willing

95
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,138
to blow up Cardassian ships
to get it?

96
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:10,801
The <i>Bok'nor</i> will never
smuggle weapons again.

97
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:11,968
And its crew members

98
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,171
won't be returning home
to their families either.

99
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:18,578
Look, you say
the Central Command

100
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:19,845
is behind the smuggling.

101
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:20,977
Fine, let's prove it.

102
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,145
How?

103
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:23,983
We'll go to Cardassia,
find the evidence

104
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:25,319
you need to back up your claim

105
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:27,552
and when we do, we'll
take it to the Federation.

106
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:30,823
No, the Federation abandoned us.

107
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:33,296
Told us to take care
of ourselves.

108
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:35,663
Well, that's what we
intend to do, Ben

109
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,158
but you--
you could be invaluable to us.

110
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,670
Let us use your station.

111
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:42,172
For what?

112
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:43,936
A maintenance facility
for our ships.

113
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:45,602
l can't allow that.

114
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:49,580
Every week, innocent people
are murdered by the Cardassians.

115
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:53,106
l will not allow those deaths
to go unpunished.

116
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,642
You don't want peace, Cal.

117
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,746
You want revenge.

118
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:04,389
l prefer to call it retaliation.

119
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,660
l am sorry we won't be
working together, Benjamin.

120
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,497
lt would have been nice.

121
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:16,504
Like... old times.

122
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:26,378
Commander!

123
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:28,045
Sorry, Benjamin.

124
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:30,577
No!

125
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:31,589
Okay, let's go.

126
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,817
Knowing Ben's temper

127
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:35,485
when he wakes up,
we won't want to be here.

128
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:37,017
Come on, let's move out.

129
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:38,859
Come on, here we go.

130
00:05:38,897 --> 00:05:40,558
Let's go, come on.

131
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,501
Lieutenant, l want to speak

132
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,437
with the Cardassian
Central Command.

133
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,939
Then you're in luck.

134
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,499
Legate Parn will be arriving
within the hour.

135
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,443
A Legate?
l feel honored.

136
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,412
While l'm waiting,
l want to speak with Starfleet.

137
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,642
Admiral Necheyev's already here.

138
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,045
Chief, the Maquis must have
transferred Dukat off their ship

139
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,555
before they reached
that asteroid.

140
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,386
l want to know
where they've hid him.

141
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:12,756
l can retrace their warp trail.

142
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,488
See if they met up
with any other ships.

143
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,756
Do it.

144
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,058
Admiral.

145
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,157
Commander, the Cardassian
Central Command

146
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,498
has gone on military alert

147
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,970
in response to the kidnapping
of Gul Dukat.

148
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,165
l'm not surprised.

149
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,437
This Security Chief of yours,
this shape-shifter...

150
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,034
-Odo.
-Odo.

151
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,046
Are you sure you
wouldn't be better off

152
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,742
with a Starfleet officer
heading your security team?

153
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,307
Admiral, l have complete faith
in Odo's ability to do his job.

154
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,546
lf you say so, Commander.

155
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:40,746
l do.

156
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,652
And as for Gul Dukat,
l assure you

157
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,590
we are taking all possible
steps to locate him.

158
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,025
Good. Keep me informed
of your progress.

159
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,085
l will.

160
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,493
But, Admiral

161
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,896
there is a bigger issue
here than rescuing Dukat.

162
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,423
And what is that?

163
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,765
The Maquis.

164
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,761
The Maquis are a bunch
of irresponsible hotheads.

165
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,502
These hotheads are responsible
for the bombing of the <i>Bok'nor.</i>

166
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,804
l'm aware of that, Commander.

167
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,813
We never should have allowed
those colonists to remain

168
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,508
on the Cardassian side
of the Demilitarized Zone.

169
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,880
Well, they're there, Admiral,
and they're not leaving.

170
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,646
What about Commander Hudson?

171
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,517
He's lived with these people.

172
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,851
What's his analysis
of the situation?

173
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,619
l'll... have to ask him.

174
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,857
You do that.

175
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:27,422
And Commander,
l want you to find the Maquis.

176
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,593
Talk to them.

177
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,296
Remind them

178
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,066
that they're citizens
of the Federation.

179
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,834
That it is imperative
that we preserve

180
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,307
the treaty with the Cardassians.

181
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,367
A treaty the Cardassians
may not be honoring.

182
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,175
Are you questioning
Federation policy, Commander?

183
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,340
All l know
is that the situation

184
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,647
in the Demilitarized Zone
is deteriorating rapidly.

185
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:49,246
Personally, l think you're
overstating the problem.

186
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,722
Establish a dialogue
with the Maquis.

187
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,884
They're still
Federation citizens.

188
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,258
l'm sure
they'll listen to reason.

189
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,785
Good luck, Commander.

190
00:09:58,832 --> 00:09:59,890
''Establish a dialogue.''

191
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,333
What the hell does she think
l've been trying to do?

192
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,336
Commander.

193
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,598
Just because a group of people

194
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,435
belong to the Federation
that does not mean

195
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,440
that they are saints.

196
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,441
Excuse me.

197
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,703
Do you know
what the trouble is?!

198
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:10,710
No.

199
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,268
The trouble is Earth.

200
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,370
Really?

201
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:17,008
On Earth, there is no poverty,
no crime, no war.

202
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,610
You look out the window
of Starfleet headquarters

203
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:20,779
and you see paradise.

204
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,755
Well, it's easy to be a saint

205
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,417
in paradise,
but the Maquis do not live

206
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,256
in paradise.

207
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,125
Out there,
in the Demilitarized Zone

208
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,459
all the problems
haven't been solved yet.

209
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:35,093
Out there, there are no saints,
just people--

210
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,467
angry, scared, determined people

211
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,836
who are going to do
whatever it takes to survive

212
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,603
whether it meets with the
Federation's approval or not.

213
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,542
Makes sense to me.

214
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,616
Well, l'm glad
someone understands.

215
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,347
Legate Parn's ship just put in
at Docking Bay 5.

216
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,914
Maybe you'd like to give
the same speech to him.

217
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,654
l just might do that.

218
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,321
Odo to Sisko.

219
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,829
Go ahead, Constable.

220
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,729
l think you'd better
get down to Security.

221
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,256
l've caught one
of the Vulcan's accomplices.

222
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,068
l assure you, l had no idea

223
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,733
Sakonna was planning
to kidnap Gul Dukat.

224
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,207
Really?

225
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,609
Then perhaps you could explain
why the two of you

226
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,374
were spending
so much time together.

227
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,938
Surely it's no crime

228
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,110
keeping company
with a beautiful female.

229
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,483
You ought to try it, Odo.

230
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,351
lt might improve
your disposition.

231
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,855
Do you expect us to believe

232
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,755
that a Vulcan
would be interested in you

233
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,985
for your lobes?

234
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,826
Vulcans are a species
that appreciate good ears.

235
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,959
Commander,
this is very embarrassing

236
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:44,129
having to discuss my personal
life in such surroundings.

237
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,866
Embarrassment is going to be
the least of your problems

238
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,432
unless you tell me what kind
of business arrangement

239
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,670
you had with this woman.

240
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,976
All right, but first
l want to make it clear

241
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,882
that l was led astray
by Sakonna's feminine wiles.

242
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,749
Save the excuses, Quark.

243
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,981
Just tell us
what you were up to.

244
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,957
Sakonna was in the market
for certain items

245
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,891
which l was able to obtain.

246
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,691
At a considerable discount,
l might add.

247
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,390
What items?

248
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,702
We're waiting.

249
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,472
Let's see... where to begin?

250
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:24,602
She wanted
some deflector shields

251
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,475
navigational arrays

252
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:30,677
maybe a couple hundred
photon torpedoes...

253
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,844
Photon torpedoes!

254
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,945
And pulse cannons

255
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,081
and some high-energy disrupters.

256
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,614
Weapons! You sold weapons
to a terrorist group.

257
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,024
l did not.

258
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,461
The Pygorians
sold them the weapons.

259
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,954
l merely...
made some introductions.

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,991
Besides, l hadn't even heard
of the Maquis

261
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,593
until after Dukat was kidnapped.

262
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:54,630
l want a complete list
of every weapon she purchased.

263
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,107
Of course,
and if you need someone

264
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,666
to testify against Sakonna
in court

265
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,440
l'd be more than willing.

266
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,503
Would you?

267
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,515
ln a second, and let me know

268
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,780
if there's anyone else
who needs testifying against.

269
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,650
l'll tell you one thing,
Commander.

270
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,245
Sakonna was on a tight clock.

271
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,484
Whatever she needed
those weapons for

272
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,288
it's going to happen
within the next few days.

273
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,851
Just get me the list.

274
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,886
Sir, l assume
you'll be going out

275
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,489
to search for Dukat again.

276
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,397
As soon as O'Brien
tells us where to look.

277
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,402
As Chief of Security,
l'd like to go along.

278
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,370
l'll be happy to have you along.

279
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:29,933
And one other thing--
how long do l keep him here?

280
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,568
Forever.

281
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,207
Odo...

282
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,650
This isn't funny.

283
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,347
Odo!

284
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,878
This is Legate Parn.

285
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,822
He insisted
on seeing you immediately.

286
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,553
Because my business
here is crucial

287
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,410
it demands immediate attention.

288
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:52,239
And as a member of the
Cardassian Central Command

289
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,906
l must assure you, Commander

290
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:56,849
that what we have to discuss
is most crucial, indeed.

291
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:58,351
l understand.

292
00:13:58,385 --> 00:14:00,319
l assure you
we are doing everything we can

293
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:01,685
to find Gul Dukat.

294
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:04,190
Please, Commander,
your efforts are appreciated

295
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:05,954
but unnecessary.

296
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:09,224
You see, Central Command
has learned that Gul Dukat

297
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:12,664
was the leader of a small group
of misguided officers

298
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,225
who were funneling
weapons to our colonies

299
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:17,066
in the Demilitarized Zone.

300
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:18,729
Then the Maquis were right.

301
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:20,467
The Cardassian settlers
are being supplied

302
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:21,634
by Central Command.

303
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:22,733
Dukat and the others

304
00:14:22,776 --> 00:14:25,301
were operating entirely
without our knowledge.

305
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:27,837
Central Command would
never sanction anything

306
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:31,010
that would violate our treaty
with the Federation.

307
00:14:33,587 --> 00:14:35,953
We've arrested
Dukat's coconspirators

308
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,618
and they shall be
dealt with accordingly.

309
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:40,490
Where does that leave Dukat?

310
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:42,962
With the Maquis,
where he belongs.

311
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:45,522
Are you saying
you don't want him back?

312
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:49,093
l assume the Maquis
will execute him for his crimes.

313
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:50,262
l wouldn't be surprised.

314
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:51,828
Well, then l don't see
what difference it makes

315
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:54,204
whether we do it
or they do it.

316
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,038
How do we know
they won't use Dukat's death

317
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:58,510
as an excuse to send troops
into the Demilitarized Zone?

318
00:14:58,546 --> 00:14:59,911
l can assure you, Commander

319
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:01,972
that there shall
be no retaliation.

320
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:09,350
The Cardassians have no
desire to go to war again

321
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,857
with the Federation.

322
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:12,153
You have my word.

323
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:13,318
Your word.

324
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,827
Major.

325
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:17,160
l found our little
talk very enlightening.

326
00:15:17,197 --> 00:15:19,688
l hoped you would.

327
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,792
Unfortunately, l have
some business to attend to

328
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:23,700
but l do hope
you'll take the time

329
00:15:23,737 --> 00:15:25,204
to enjoy the station.

330
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,729
Thank you, Commander

331
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:29,607
but l, too,
must attend to my business.

332
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:40,549
Besides, l am afraid
this place has lost its charm

333
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:43,557
since the last time l was here.

334
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,454
l don't believe a word he said.

335
00:15:50,497 --> 00:15:51,987
Neither do l.

336
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:55,559
But he did tell me something
that l needed to know.

337
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:57,093
Cal was right.

338
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:59,833
The Central Command
is smuggling weapons

339
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:02,137
into the Demilitarized Zone.

340
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,449
We just received a report

341
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:14,682
that three Federation settlers
were killed on Hakton Vll.

342
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:16,986
The Cardassians claim
it was in response

343
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:18,924
to the destruction
of the <i>Bok'nor.</i>

344
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,519
Which gives the Maquis
a new excuse to strike back.

345
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:22,824
Chief, what have you found?

346
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:24,888
Based on the residual
subspace distortion

347
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:28,231
of their warp drive,
l was able to plot the course

348
00:16:28,268 --> 00:16:30,566
of the Maquis ship
that took Dukat.

349
00:16:30,604 --> 00:16:32,162
As you can see,
long-range sensors

350
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,764
show no signs
of any other vessels

351
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:35,069
traveling along that route.

352
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:37,736
All right, they didn't transfer
him to another ship.

353
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:39,245
What about a planet?

354
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,678
lt's possible.

355
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:42,875
Their course took them
past five M-Class planets.

356
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,781
l've downloaded
their coordinates

357
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:46,513
into the <i>Rio Grande's</i> computer.

358
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:47,679
Good work.

359
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:48,881
Sisko to Odo.

360
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:49,946
Yes, Commander.

361
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,048
Find Dr. Bashir

362
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:52,718
and meet me immediately
at Landing Pad C.

363
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,727
On our way.

364
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:55,251
Commander, you know
there's no reason

365
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,262
to go after Dukat.

366
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:57,456
l mean, you heard Legate Parn.

367
00:16:57,498 --> 00:16:58,522
They don't want him back.

368
00:16:58,565 --> 00:17:00,795
Are you suggesting
we leave him to the Maquis?

369
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:04,895
Why risk our lives over someone
who's caused so many deaths?

370
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:05,905
The way l see it

371
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,873
he's getting exactly
what he deserves.

372
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,970
The Central Command
wants him dead.

373
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:16,005
That's reason enough
for us to want him alive.

374
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,540
Landing Pad C.

375
00:17:27,194 --> 00:17:31,358
My mind to your mind.

376
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:35,596
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

377
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:40,232
My mind to your mind.

378
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:43,869
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

379
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:48,405
My mind to your mind...

380
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:51,316
What is wrong?

381
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:53,251
lt's not working.

382
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:55,721
That is what's wrong.

383
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:59,086
This is quite puzzling.

384
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:01,855
l am unable to establish
a mind-meld.

385
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:04,420
lt would appear
he has the ability

386
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:06,763
to shield his thoughts.

387
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,927
Simply a matter of discipline.

388
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:10,732
Now what do we do?

389
00:18:10,771 --> 00:18:14,502
l will rest awhile
and then l will try again.

390
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:19,137
You people really do not
do this very well, do you?

391
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:23,548
Now, on Cardassia, we know
how to extract information

392
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:26,747
though it can get
a bit... unpleasant

393
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:29,950
and we all know
how the Federation

394
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,821
dislikes unpleasantness.

395
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:34,225
l share very few sentiments
with the Federation.

396
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:36,058
Ooh, that's right.

397
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:38,996
You're renegades,
aren't you?

398
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:43,528
Or so you'd like to think.

399
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,435
Unfortunately, the Federation

400
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:48,066
has taught you your lessons
all too well.

401
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:52,067
You simply lack
the commitment it takes

402
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:54,603
to do what is necessary.

403
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:58,345
You tell that to the crew
of the <i>Bok'nor.</i>

404
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:00,751
Oh, anyone can blow up a ship.

405
00:19:02,656 --> 00:19:05,989
But to look your enemy
in the eye

406
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:08,017
knowing you'll
remember his face

407
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:13,464
for the rest of your life,
now, that takes...

408
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,233
a stomach much stronger
than you'll ever have.

409
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:19,967
We'll see about that.

410
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:21,474
No.

411
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:22,805
He's right.

412
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:24,276
We do not possess

413
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:27,474
the Cardassian gift
for inflicting pain.

414
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:31,014
There. You see?

415
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:33,246
Nor would we want such a gift.

416
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:36,313
But we do need to know
when the Central Command

417
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:38,722
is sending
its next weapons shipment.

418
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,250
So, if it's all the same
to you, Sakonna

419
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:43,422
l'll take over
this interrogation.

420
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:46,159
Then we can find out
just how committed l am.

421
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,192
l don't think
anyone's that interested.

422
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:50,362
Put down your weapons.

423
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:51,871
We're not here to fight you.

424
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:54,032
lf that is true, then you will
let us go about our business.

425
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:55,871
l'm not leaving without Dukat.

426
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:57,069
Then you're not leaving.

427
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,771
Look, we're all
on the same side here.

428
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:00,541
We all want to stop
the arms shipments.

429
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:01,570
Why not work together?

430
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:05,483
Will you stop talking
and shoot them?

431
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,884
No, that's not what we want.

432
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,547
What are you waiting for?

433
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:10,489
Put down your weapons.

434
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:12,594
Do as he says.

435
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:14,456
Shoot them!

436
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:40,786
Let him go!

437
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,221
l said let him go!

438
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:45,021
Odo, get these people
secured on the runabout.

439
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,254
With pleasure, Commander.

440
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:47,591
Except this one.

441
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:49,426
You mean l'm free to go?

442
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:51,261
Tell Cal Hudson

443
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:52,994
l haven't told Starfleet
anything yet.

444
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,365
Tell him, we can still

445
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:57,667
solve this thing together,
but we're running out of time.

446
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:00,402
Tell him, l still
have his uniform.

447
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:03,434
He can have it back
anytime he wants.

448
00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:30,627
Ah.

449
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:40,180
Enter.

450
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:45,544
l just came by to see
how you were doing.

451
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,818
l find a good meal
extremely relaxing

452
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:50,791
especially
after a difficult day.

453
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:52,656
-So do l.
-Really?

454
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:55,822
l wonder what else
we have in common.

455
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:58,128
Very little, l imagine.

456
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:03,536
Other than the fact
that you have my office.

457
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:13,002
Tell me, what's going to happen
with your prisoners?

458
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:15,277
They'll be tried
for their crimes

459
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:17,580
under the Federation
Code of Justice.

460
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:19,484
And if they're found innocent?

461
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:20,647
l doubt that they will

462
00:22:20,688 --> 00:22:22,952
but, if they are,
they'll be set free.

463
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:24,288
How barbaric.

464
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:27,590
ln Cardassia,
the verdict is always known

465
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:29,529
before the trial begins

466
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:31,054
and it's always the same.

467
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,327
ln that case, why bother
with a trial at all?

468
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:36,804
Because the people demand it.

469
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:43,937
They enjoy watching justice
triumph over evil every time.

470
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:45,775
They find it comforting.

471
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:47,611
lsn't there ever a chance

472
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:50,083
you might try
an innocent man by mistake?

473
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:53,348
Cardassians don't make mistakes.

474
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:55,652
l'll have to remember that.

475
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,586
Commander...

476
00:23:03,531 --> 00:23:07,228
one thing does puzzle me.

477
00:23:07,268 --> 00:23:11,261
Surely the Central Command
was informed of my kidnapping.

478
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,742
They learned about it
almost as soon as it happened.

479
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:17,040
Then why was l rescued by you?

480
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:20,605
Why wasn't the station
surrounded by Cardassian ships

481
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:22,138
demanding my release?

482
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:25,880
We did receive a visit
from Legate Parn.

483
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,254
Ah! l'm sure he made some rather
ugly threats on my behalf, hmm?

484
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,987
He said that you
were the one responsible

485
00:23:33,027 --> 00:23:36,360
for smuggling weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone.

486
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:38,797
That if the Maquis
did not execute you

487
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,596
then the Central Command
would...

488
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:44,230
after a comforting trial,
l'm sure.

489
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:53,376
Well...

490
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:57,510
it seems my relationship
with the Central Command

491
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:59,850
has somewhat deteriorated.

492
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:02,186
l knew this was inevitable

493
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:05,158
the moment we withdrew
from Bajor.

494
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,957
Are you saying they blamed you
for the withdrawal?

495
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:11,193
Ha! There are those who believe

496
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:14,998
l should have killed
every last Bajoran

497
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,027
while l had the chance.

498
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:18,936
Oh, well.

499
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:22,033
lt's too late for that,
l'm afraid.

500
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,476
Commander, it seems l was mis...

501
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:28,505
Mistaken
about the arms shipment?

502
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:31,040
lt appears l was misinformed.

503
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:33,279
l'm beginning to believe

504
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:37,417
the Central Command
is indeed smuggling weapons

505
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:40,791
into the Demilitarized Zone
after all.

506
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:43,296
Then you really
didn't know, did you?

507
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:44,423
No.

508
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,762
They never bothered to tell me.

509
00:24:53,474 --> 00:24:56,568
lf l help you stop the smuggling

510
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:59,876
will you help me
stop the Maquis?

511
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,253
You have a deal.

512
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,850
l've scheduled
a staff meeting for 0900.

513
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:13,155
l'll be there.

514
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:16,686
Commander... thank you

515
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:19,291
for coming to my rescue.

516
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:22,497
l'm sure you would have done
the same for me.

517
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:42,221
Constable, do you have
the list of weapons

518
00:25:42,256 --> 00:25:43,780
Sakonna bought from Quark?

519
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:46,293
l do, and quite a list it is.

520
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:48,727
Six ship-mounted
high-energy disrupters

521
00:25:48,763 --> 00:25:51,823
three particle accelerators,
200 photon torpedoes

522
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:53,527
and a dozen pulse cannons.

523
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:54,899
With that kind of firepower

524
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:56,426
the Bajorans
could have launched

525
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,063
a full-scale assault
on Cardassia.

526
00:25:58,106 --> 00:25:59,232
And lost.

527
00:25:59,273 --> 00:26:01,571
Sounds like the Maquis
have had their fill

528
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:02,576
of border skirmishes.

529
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,168
They're ready
for something bigger.

530
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:05,179
According to Quark

531
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:07,306
they're planning
their first attack any day now.

532
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:10,146
Have you been able to make
any headway with Sakonna?

533
00:26:10,184 --> 00:26:11,151
Have you ever tried

534
00:26:11,185 --> 00:26:12,675
to interrogate a Vulcan,
Lieutenant?

535
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,687
No.

536
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:14,983
Well, neither had l,
until today.

537
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:16,490
l wouldn't advise it.

538
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:19,550
That calm, measured voice
that tells you nothing

539
00:26:19,594 --> 00:26:21,289
that impassive stare--

540
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,126
it can be quite frustrating.

541
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,257
Perhaps l could question her.

542
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:26,425
l don't think so.

543
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:27,593
Pity.

544
00:26:27,635 --> 00:26:28,863
l like a challenge.

545
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:29,892
You want a challenge?

546
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:31,461
Find out how the Central Command

547
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,770
is getting weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone.

548
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:37,039
My guess would be by way
of a Xepolite free trader.

549
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:38,942
Why the Xepolites?

550
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,675
Because the Xepolites
have often served

551
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:42,342
as intermediaries for us
in the past.

552
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,977
So have the Lissepians.

553
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:48,147
Ah, but the Xepolites
have never been caught.

554
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,187
The Xepolite ship isn't
responding to our hails, sir.

555
00:26:57,231 --> 00:26:58,698
Of course
they're not responding.

556
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:01,065
Would you respond
to a Federation hail

557
00:27:01,135 --> 00:27:03,535
if your cargo bays
were full of Cardassian weapons?

558
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:04,629
Scan their ship, Major.

559
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:06,162
Let's see what they're carrying.

560
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,005
Our scanners can't
penetrate their hull.

561
00:27:09,043 --> 00:27:10,930
No wonder.

562
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:13,691
lt's composed of
a sensor-reflective material.

563
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,894
They obviously value
their privacy.

564
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:18,267
Chief, you and Gul
Dukat remain here.

565
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,862
Major, you're with me.

566
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,338
Let's go see
if it's their privacy

567
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:23,205
or their guilt,
they're trying to protect.

568
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,142
Sorry, Commander,
you can't transport over.

569
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,508
They just raised their shields.

570
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:29,139
You're wasting time.

571
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,776
Xepolite ships can reach
a maximum speed of warp 9.8.

572
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,309
lf they decide to run,
we'll never catch them.

573
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,685
Well, what would you suggest?

574
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,781
l would breach their shields
with my phasers

575
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,984
and destroy their Bridge.

576
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,118
Killing everyone there.

577
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,388
That's correct.

578
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:45,124
Then l would lock onto the ship
with my tractor beam

579
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,995
and tow it, and its cargo,
back to the station.

580
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:48,761
Very simple, very effective.

581
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,428
And needlessly bloody.

582
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,994
Sounds like a Cardassian
plan to me.

583
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:54,835
Chief, fire a phaser
over their bow.

584
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:57,240
Let's see if we can
get their attention.

585
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,607
Yes, sir.

586
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,115
That woke them up.

587
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,117
They're hailing us.

588
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,449
On my monitor, Chief.

589
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:10,546
l am Drofo Awa,
Hetman of this vessel.

590
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,648
What do you want from us?

591
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,090
l'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

592
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,060
of the United Federation
of Planets.

593
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,120
We believe you're carrying
Cardassian weapons

594
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,291
to their colonies
in the Demilitarized Zone.

595
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:24,359
Well, then, you believe wrong,
Commander.

596
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,268
My ship is carrying

597
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:30,264
five kilotons of Regrean
wheat husks, nothing more.

598
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:33,301
Five kilotons--
that's a lot of wheat husks.

599
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,472
With your permission,
l'd like to come aboard

600
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,811
and see what that looks like.

601
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,282
Permission denied.

602
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,979
And if there's any attempt
to board my vessel

603
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:43,487
l will consider it
an act of piracy.

604
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:44,989
ls that clear?

605
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,548
You can call it
anything you like

606
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:49,288
but you're not going anywhere
until we search your ship.

607
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,955
ln that case, Commander...

608
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:55,092
ln that case, you will do
exactly as you're told.

609
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,728
You will allow us
free access to your ship

610
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,362
so that we can verify
you are indeed smuggling

611
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,238
Cardassian weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone.

612
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,936
You will then follow us back
to Deep Space 9

613
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:06,944
where your cargo
will be confiscated

614
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,810
and you will make
a full confession

615
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,372
detailing everything you know

616
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,782
about smuggling weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone.

617
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,082
Then you will sign
that confession

618
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:19,387
after which, you and your ship
will be allowed on your way.

619
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,585
ls that clear?

620
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,287
l don't understand.

621
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,057
You're a Cardassian.

622
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,190
l'm not just any Cardassian.

623
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:30,669
l'm Gul Dukat, Commander
of the Second Order.

624
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:33,638
You have 15 seconds
to lower your shields

625
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:34,832
or we'll destroy you.

626
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:35,863
No, wait!

627
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:36,875
Ten seconds.

628
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:37,898
No, it's not that simple!

629
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:38,910
Seven seconds.

630
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,172
l've already been paid!

631
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:41,702
Four seconds.

632
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,715
Stop counting!
Stop counting!

633
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,910
He's lowering his shields.

634
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:55,153
l'll await your arrival,
Commander.

635
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:58,652
l think you can
handle it from here.

636
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,781
l hope you're happy.

637
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,880
l am a Vulcan.

638
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,653
My emotional state
is irrelevant.

639
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:27,989
Well, l'm a Ferengi

640
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:30,791
and my emotional state
is very relevant

641
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,820
and right now, l'm miserable

642
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,765
and it's all your fault.

643
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,963
You were well paid
for your assistance.

644
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,334
Not well enough.

645
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:44,240
Look, l know the Cardassians
can't be trusted.

646
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,403
l know the Central Command
would like nothing better

647
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,037
than to destroy
the Federation colonies

648
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,980
in the Demilitarized Zone.

649
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,040
Then you agree
with our position?

650
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,449
Not for a second.

651
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:54,782
Why not?

652
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,017
Because your position
is illogical.

653
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:01,026
Do you propose
to lecture me on logic?

654
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:07,124
l don't want to,
but you leave me no choice.

655
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,793
lt all comes down

656
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,701
to the Third Rule
of Acquisition.

657
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:14,171
You don't know that one, do you?

658
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,573
l am not well-versed
in Ferengi philosophy.

659
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,271
Remind me to give you
a copy of the Rules.

660
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,006
You never know
when they'll come in handy.

661
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,846
Now, the Third Rule
clearly states

662
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,374
''Never spend more
for an acquisition

663
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,387
than you have to.''

664
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,013
Logical, but l fail to see

665
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,183
how that applies
to my situation.

666
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,422
You want to acquire peace.

667
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:38,953
Fine. Peace is good

668
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,831
but how much are you
willing to pay for it?

669
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,334
Whatever it costs.

670
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:45,496
That's the kind
of irresponsible spending

671
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,005
that causes so many
business ventures to fail.

672
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,735
You're forgetting
the Third Rule.

673
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:52,744
Right now, peace could be bought
at a bargain price

674
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,678
and you don't even realize it.

675
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:57,011
l find this very confusing.

676
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:01,449
Then l'll make it so simple

677
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:04,354
that even a Vulcan
can understand.

678
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,757
The Central Command has
been caught red-handed

679
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,590
smuggling weapons
to their settlers.

680
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:13,496
So, every ship that approaches
the Demilitarized Zone

681
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:14,624
will be searched.

682
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,897
Without the support
of the Central Command

683
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,699
the Cardassian settlers
won't be so eager to fight.

684
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:22,536
You forget the weapons
they already have.

685
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,599
They have weapons.

686
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,440
You have weapons.

687
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,309
Everyone has weapons

688
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:31,839
but right now, no one
has a clear advantage.

689
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:35,376
So, the price of peace
is at an all-time low.

690
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:38,288
This is the perfect time
to sit down

691
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,485
and hammer out an agreement.

692
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:41,993
Don't you get it?

693
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:45,827
Attacking the Cardassians now
will only escalate the conflict

694
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:51,234
and make peace more expensive
in the long run.

695
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,933
Now, l ask you, is that logical?

696
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:59,243
A concealed weapons depot

697
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,270
located within
a civilian population center?

698
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,838
According to Sakonna

699
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:06,510
the Maquis are going
to attack the depot

700
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,782
sometime
within the next 52 hours.

701
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,482
But she didn't tell you
on which colony

702
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,989
the depot is hidden.

703
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:12,991
She says she doesn't know.

704
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:13,992
How convenient.

705
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,084
l believe her.

706
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:17,721
Why?
Because Vulcans don't lie?

707
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,196
As a rule, they don't.

708
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,893
They don't blow up
ships either, as a rule.

709
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:24,459
But let's assume
she's telling the truth.

710
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,301
l take it you haven't
shared this information

711
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,102
with the Central Command?

712
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,938
No, l haven't.

713
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,739
Good, because they
would never trust you

714
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,006
to handle this matter alone.

715
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35,239
But they would be able

716
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,714
to tell me where
the weapons depot is located.

717
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,377
Leave that to me.

718
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:43,650
l may no longer be a favorite
with Central Command

719
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,589
but l know people who are.

720
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:49,953
ln the meantime,
l'll go to Volon lll

721
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,792
and try to talk some sense
into the Maquis.

722
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,888
And if you can't?

723
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,865
Don't worry, Dukat.

724
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,633
l said l would stop the Maquis,
and, one way or another, l will.

725
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,218
l've also
been recently informed

726
00:34:16,261 --> 00:34:18,661
that 35 people
had to be hospitalized

727
00:34:18,697 --> 00:34:20,460
on Umoth Vlll after eating

728
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:22,523
from public food replicators.

729
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,228
Sabotage is suspected.

730
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:26,737
Then from now on,
guards should be posted

731
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:28,966
at all public replicators
throughout the colonies.

732
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,972
Thank you.

733
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,633
Now, about the new curfew...

734
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:37,177
Commander Sisko,
what a pleasant surprise.

735
00:34:37,215 --> 00:34:39,308
lf you'll just wait a moment,
l'll finish up this meeting

736
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:40,750
and we can talk privately.

737
00:34:40,785 --> 00:34:42,776
That won't be necessary.

738
00:34:42,821 --> 00:34:45,881
l want everyone to hear
what l have to say.

739
00:34:45,924 --> 00:34:48,358
l don't know
how many of you here

740
00:34:48,393 --> 00:34:50,623
actually belong to the Maquis.

741
00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:54,098
Those of you who don't
probably have friends who do.

742
00:34:54,132 --> 00:34:56,430
So, please make sure
you pass along

743
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:58,436
what l'm about to tell you.

744
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,335
There is a treaty
currently in place

745
00:35:00,372 --> 00:35:01,771
with Cardassia
and the Federation.

746
00:35:01,806 --> 00:35:04,604
lf you make yourself
an enemy of Cardassia

747
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:07,339
you make yourself an enemy
of the Federation.

748
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:08,505
That is outrageous.

749
00:35:08,546 --> 00:35:10,741
Agreed.

750
00:35:10,782 --> 00:35:13,615
l know the Maquis
is planning to attack

751
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:15,882
a Cardassian weapons depot.

752
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,378
My advice to them and to you
is to call it off

753
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:23,258
because l'll be waiting there,
and l will stop you.

754
00:35:31,102 --> 00:35:34,094
A very rousing speech, Ben.

755
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:37,506
l suppose my best rebuttal
would be to kill you.

756
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:39,203
But you won't.

757
00:35:43,181 --> 00:35:44,705
What is this?

758
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:46,876
Your uniform.

759
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:49,216
You always were an optimist.

760
00:35:49,254 --> 00:35:51,313
l have every reason to be.

761
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:53,881
The way l see it,
now that we've stopped

762
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:56,189
the shipments
of Cardassian weapons

763
00:35:56,227 --> 00:35:58,957
there's no longer any need
for the Maquis.

764
00:35:58,997 --> 00:36:02,558
You and l can work together
to reach a peace agreement

765
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,693
with the Cardassian colonies.

766
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,761
lt's too late for that.

767
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:08,363
ls it?

768
00:36:08,406 --> 00:36:12,172
We're in a war here,
and l intend to win it.

769
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,804
l could use your help, Ben

770
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:17,576
and l'm asking you as a friend.

771
00:36:17,615 --> 00:36:21,176
As a friend...

772
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:23,414
l have to say no.

773
00:36:23,455 --> 00:36:26,583
lf you attack the depot

774
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:29,752
you'll have
to get through me first.

775
00:36:29,794 --> 00:36:34,527
l hope not.
l truly hope not.

776
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:09,194
The Bryma colony--
according to my sources

777
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:11,259
that's the location
of the weapons depot.

778
00:37:11,302 --> 00:37:13,099
Then our objective is simple--

779
00:37:13,138 --> 00:37:15,572
prevent the Maquis ships
from reaching Bryma.

780
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:17,507
We're going
to have to intercept them

781
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:19,407
before they're picked up
by the colony's sensors.

782
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:20,411
Good point.

783
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:22,037
lf the Cardassian
settlers even suspect

784
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,172
they might come under attack

785
00:37:23,214 --> 00:37:24,613
they'll send a message
to Cardassia

786
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:25,673
asking for reinforcements.

787
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:26,684
l don't care how much

788
00:37:26,718 --> 00:37:28,276
the Cardassians
care about the treaty

789
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:30,844
if the Maquis launch an assault
against a civilian target

790
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:32,686
the Central Command
will have to respond.

791
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:35,284
We could wind up with
a full-scale war on our hands.

792
00:37:35,326 --> 00:37:37,817
We have to stop the Maquis.

793
00:37:38,997 --> 00:37:41,591
Our runabouts will take up
a defensive position

794
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:44,124
just outside the Bryma colony's
sensor range.

795
00:37:44,169 --> 00:37:45,966
The best way
to detect incoming ships

796
00:37:46,004 --> 00:37:47,972
would be to hide
a couple dozen sensor probes

797
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:49,300
in the system's Oort cloud.

798
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,932
That way,
we could spot the Maquis

799
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:52,567
no matter what route they take.

800
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,771
How many Maquis ships
are we expecting?

801
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:56,542
According to Sakonna,
they only have two ships

802
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:58,344
capable of mounting
the weapons she purchased.

803
00:37:58,383 --> 00:38:00,248
So, we'll have three ships,
and they'll have two.

804
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:01,582
The odds are in our favor,
anyway.

805
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:05,385
That's not going to give us
much of an advantage, Julian.

806
00:38:05,423 --> 00:38:07,015
The colonists are used
to being outnumbered.

807
00:38:07,058 --> 00:38:08,355
They'll fight just
that much harder.

808
00:38:08,393 --> 00:38:10,020
How do you propose to stop them?

809
00:38:10,061 --> 00:38:12,052
What's that human expression?

810
00:38:12,096 --> 00:38:13,893
''Shoot to kill.''

811
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:16,196
We'll try to stop
them with words

812
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:18,725
if possible;
with force, if necessary.

813
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,603
So, if they fire at us,
we have orders to shoot back.

814
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,038
That's correct.

815
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:25,440
We'll target their warp engines
and weapons arrays--

816
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:26,444
try to disable them.

817
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:27,672
How noble.

818
00:38:27,712 --> 00:38:31,045
l hope the Maquis will be
as obliging to you.

819
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:39,112
<i>Rio Grande</i> to
<i>Mekong</i> and <i>Orinoco.</i>

820
00:38:39,157 --> 00:38:40,488
How do you read me?

821
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:41,890
<i>Orinoco</i> here.
You're loud and clear.

822
00:38:41,926 --> 00:38:43,086
<i>Mekong</i> here.

823
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:46,426
Our communications channel
is fully operational and secure.

824
00:38:46,464 --> 00:38:48,056
The remote sensor
probes l set up

825
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:50,659
still haven't detected
any sign of the Maquis ships.

826
00:38:50,702 --> 00:38:52,431
Do you really think
they're coming?

827
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,631
They know we're waiting
for them, after all.

828
00:38:54,672 --> 00:38:57,903
lt's possible they changed
the time frame of their attack--

829
00:38:57,942 --> 00:38:59,466
postponed it a day or a week.

830
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:00,705
They'll be here.

831
00:39:00,745 --> 00:39:02,838
The longer they wait,
the greater the chance

832
00:39:02,881 --> 00:39:05,441
the weapons depot will be
moved to another location.

833
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:17,853
Commander, l'm picking up

834
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:19,625
two Federation ships
headed our way.

835
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:22,189
Sisko to Hudson.

836
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:23,928
This isn't going to work, Cal.

837
00:39:24,002 --> 00:39:27,597
Turn those ships around
before someone gets hurt.

838
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:31,735
Please, Ben,
don't make me open fire on you.

839
00:39:34,212 --> 00:39:36,077
He's not going to listen.

840
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:38,275
lnitiating evasive maneuvers.

841
00:39:38,316 --> 00:39:40,682
Signal Niles to follow my lead.

842
00:39:40,718 --> 00:39:42,345
Right.

843
00:39:51,396 --> 00:39:52,954
Commander, they're
making a run for it.

844
00:39:53,031 --> 00:39:54,965
Lock on tractor beams.

845
00:39:58,036 --> 00:39:59,970
Damn it!

846
00:40:00,038 --> 00:40:01,528
They've got Niles, too.

847
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:04,241
Let us go, Ben.

848
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:06,140
You know l can't do that.

849
00:40:06,177 --> 00:40:07,474
Then l suggest you duck.

850
00:40:09,113 --> 00:40:10,876
Fire on their beam emitter.

851
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,371
What are you waiting for?

852
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:20,936
We're losing tractor lock.

853
00:40:21,014 --> 00:40:22,311
They're breaking away.

854
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:23,872
Commence firing.

855
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:30,621
Niles' propulsion system
is down.

856
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:31,954
He's drifting.

857
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:33,686
We'll have to even the odds.

858
00:40:38,531 --> 00:40:40,795
They've hit
our navigational array.

859
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,825
l've lost attitude control.

860
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:44,894
Attempting to compensate

861
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:46,269
with manual thrusters.

862
00:40:46,306 --> 00:40:47,398
lt's not working.

863
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,805
Thrusters are still locked.

864
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:49,934
Hang on.

865
00:40:49,976 --> 00:40:51,409
Chief, you go after
the <i>Orinoco.</i>

866
00:40:51,444 --> 00:40:52,468
l'll handle Hudson.

867
00:40:52,512 --> 00:40:53,536
Right. Major.

868
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,911
-Yes, Chief?
-Lower your shields.

869
00:40:54,948 --> 00:40:56,176
We'll beam you out of there.

870
00:40:56,216 --> 00:40:57,183
You got it.

871
00:40:57,217 --> 00:40:59,515
They're coming back around.

872
00:41:01,788 --> 00:41:04,086
lt's just you and me, Ben.

873
00:41:04,123 --> 00:41:06,091
l can't let you start a war.

874
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,184
l'm not turning back.

875
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:09,786
And you're not going forward.

876
00:41:17,637 --> 00:41:19,696
We're hit.

877
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:21,468
Our photon torpedo tubes
are out.

878
00:41:21,507 --> 00:41:22,701
Switch to phasers.

879
00:41:22,742 --> 00:41:27,543
Come about,
heading 1 15 mark 326.

880
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,911
Got it.

881
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:42,621
We've taken a direct hit
on our primary fusion core.

882
00:41:42,662 --> 00:41:45,153
lnitiating emergency
core shutdown.

883
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:48,656
The port nacelle is flooded
with ionized deuterium.

884
00:41:48,701 --> 00:41:51,636
We've lost both warp
and impulse engines.

885
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:54,139
We still have
maneuvering thrusters.

886
00:41:57,677 --> 00:41:58,939
They're coming back around.

887
00:41:58,978 --> 00:41:59,945
Use the phasers.

888
00:41:59,979 --> 00:42:01,537
l can't.

889
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:03,446
They've knocked out
the power couplings

890
00:42:03,483 --> 00:42:04,507
to our weapons array.

891
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,609
What do we do?

892
00:42:06,653 --> 00:42:08,518
The only thing we can do.

893
00:42:08,554 --> 00:42:10,715
We get the hell out of here.

894
00:42:14,761 --> 00:42:15,728
He's turning away.

895
00:42:15,762 --> 00:42:17,161
Now's your chance-- fire.

896
00:42:17,196 --> 00:42:18,663
lt's over, Cal.

897
00:42:18,698 --> 00:42:20,791
For now, anyway.

898
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:22,926
Next time, tell Starfleet
to send someone else.

899
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:24,459
lt doesn't feel right,
you and l

900
00:42:24,504 --> 00:42:25,596
shooting at each other.

901
00:42:25,638 --> 00:42:26,935
There won't be a next time.

902
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,938
Stand down!

903
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,941
l don't think so, Ben.

904
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:31,307
He's getting away!

905
00:42:31,344 --> 00:42:34,142
You run now,
l won't be able to protect you.

906
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,807
Starfleet will track you down.

907
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:37,281
You won't be safe anywhere--

908
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:39,683
not even in the colonies.

909
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:40,708
Don't be so sure.

910
00:42:40,753 --> 00:42:42,277
l have a lot of friends here.

911
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:45,257
Besides, l've got to help
the Maquis finish this thing.

912
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:46,758
You'll be an outlaw--

913
00:42:46,793 --> 00:42:47,851
a hunted man.

914
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:49,191
Maybe.

915
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:50,957
You're throwing away
your entire life.

916
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:53,828
And beginning a new one.

917
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:55,629
What are you waiting for?

918
00:42:55,668 --> 00:42:57,636
He's helpless.
Finish him.

919
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,968
l'm going to miss you, Ben.

920
00:43:00,006 --> 00:43:02,304
You've been a good friend.

921
00:43:07,046 --> 00:43:09,037
So have you.

922
00:43:09,082 --> 00:43:11,209
No!

923
00:43:16,155 --> 00:43:19,056
l thought you were strong,
Commander.

924
00:43:19,092 --> 00:43:20,753
You're not.

925
00:43:20,793 --> 00:43:22,226
You're a fool.

926
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:24,923
A sentimental fool.

927
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:27,933
l said l'd stop the Maquis,
and l have

928
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:31,095
but l will not kill a good man
for defending his home.

929
00:43:31,137 --> 00:43:33,901
You disappoint me.

930
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,103
Don't expect me to lose
any sleep over it.

931
00:43:37,143 --> 00:43:38,906
Mr. O'Brien,
when you get a chance

932
00:43:38,945 --> 00:43:41,106
l could use some help
with these engines.

933
00:43:41,147 --> 00:43:42,136
Yes, sir.

934
00:43:50,523 --> 00:43:53,515
Commander, Gul Dukat
has left the station.

935
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:55,424
l'm sure he's glad
to be going home.

936
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:56,428
Chief O'Brien says

937
00:43:56,462 --> 00:43:58,259
that the <i>Orinoco</i>
and the <i>Rio Grande</i>

938
00:43:58,297 --> 00:44:00,094
will be up and running
in a few days.

939
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:01,657
Thank you, Major.

940
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:04,693
l just got a communiqué
from Starfleet

941
00:44:04,737 --> 00:44:06,830
congratulating me
on my good work

942
00:44:06,873 --> 00:44:10,900
and thanking me for preserving
the peace with the Cardassians.

943
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:12,808
You deserve it.

944
00:44:12,845 --> 00:44:14,904
You prevented a war.

945
00:44:15,014 --> 00:44:17,539
Did l?

946
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:20,848
Or did l just
delay the inevitable?
