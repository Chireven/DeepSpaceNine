1
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:04,890
Medical Log, supplemental.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,989
Major Kira and l
are returning home

3
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:09,159
after opening the hospital
on New Bajor

4
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:12,135
the first Bajoran colony
in the Gamma Quadrant.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,330
Oh...

6
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:14,771
could you take it for a while?

7
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,000
Sure.

8
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,906
Do you mind
if l listen to some music?

9
00:00:17,943 --> 00:00:19,035
Actually, l do.

10
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:21,068
l was hoping to meditate
for a few minutes.

11
00:00:21,113 --> 00:00:22,137
Of course.

12
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,341
l didn't know you meditate.

13
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:25,907
Every day.

14
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:27,976
l had the opportunity
of studying meditation

15
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,817
with lsam Helewa
when l was at college.

16
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:30,981
A remarkable fellow.

17
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:32,513
He sort of took
me under his wing.

18
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:34,582
l can't tell you how much
l learned from him.

19
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:36,560
The man was a master
at rhythmic breathing.

20
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:39,189
You'll have to give me
a few tips sometime.

21
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:40,390
Gladly.

22
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:41,865
Oh, and l'd be more
than interested

23
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,198
in learning any Bajoran
meditation techniques

24
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:45,533
you might like to show me.

25
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,973
We usually just like
to sit...

26
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,999
quietly.

27
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,752
What are you doing?

28
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,561
Bellows breath--
it's a series of quick intakes

29
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:14,895
followed by one long intake
of air through the nose.

30
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:15,922
Hold... release.

31
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,628
lncreases the energy flow.

32
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:18,795
lt's quite simple.

33
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:19,861
Let me show you.

34
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:22,499
How about some music?

35
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,838
Ah. What's your pleasure?

36
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,777
l'm afraid my musical knowledge
is limited to Bajoran composers.

37
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:31,078
Computer, play us a little
something by Tor Jolan.

38
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:32,174
You know Tor's work?

39
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,707
Oh, l've made it
a point to listen

40
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:35,686
to Bajoran music
ever since l arrived.

41
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,188
Really?

42
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,315
Tor strikes me as the best
of the lot, really.

43
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:40,552
Well, slightly derivative

44
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:43,356
of the great Boldaric masters
of the last century

45
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,589
but pleasantly diverting.

46
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:47,059
Hmm, this is nice.

47
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:50,193
l'm glad we're
finally doing this.

48
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,702
What?

49
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,398
Talking to one another.

50
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:55,201
Finding common interests.

51
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:56,535
Burying the hatchet.

52
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,667
Hatchet?

53
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:58,869
A human expression.

54
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,673
lt means that
we're finally putting

55
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:02,009
past conflicts behind us.

56
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:03,878
Making way for brand-new ones.

57
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,143
Right.

58
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:07,515
You know, Nerys...
May l call you Nerys?

59
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:08,780
Sure.

60
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,448
Even when we weren't
getting along

61
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,390
l've always felt you were

62
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,019
one of the most
interesting women

63
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:17,494
l've ever met.

64
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:20,123
l'm very serious.

65
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:21,359
Thank you, Doctor.

66
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,061
Julian.

67
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,934
Go on, say it.

68
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:29,304
-Julian.
-Julian.

69
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,003
lt was hard for Chief O'Brien,
as well, at first.

70
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:34,739
We had our problems, too,
but now we're like this.

71
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,179
One minute to the wormhole.

72
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:37,875
Stand by to drop to impulse.

73
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,111
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

74
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:43,451
l, uh, l think you'd
better stick with Dax.

75
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:44,455
l'm sorry?

76
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:45,478
Oh!

77
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,048
You thought
that l was trying to...

78
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:49,082
No, no...

79
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,185
My, my mistake.

80
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:51,695
But if l thought...

81
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,697
Forget it!

82
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:53,698
Right.

83
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:55,791
Take us out of warp.

84
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:58,500
What's wrong?

85
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:00,562
The warp field's
not fully collapsed.

86
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:02,072
l'm showing
a plasma injector leak.

87
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:03,631
lnjector controllers
are locked.

88
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:05,006
l'm trying to compensate.

89
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:11,748
lnjectors opening,
velocity falling.

90
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:14,978
What was that?

91
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,920
lnitiating emergency
stabilization control.

92
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:25,255
Are you all right?

93
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:27,959
A little dizzy.

94
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,159
Yeah, me, too.

95
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:32,398
l guess we're lucky
to be in one piece.

96
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,981
Oh, we'd better get
Mr. O'Brien to take a...

97
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,074
What the hell?

98
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:48,585
Where's the station?

99
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,781
What happened to the station?

100
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:52,915
l have it on long-range sensors.

101
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,186
lt's...

102
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:55,418
orbiting Bajor?

103
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,189
Major...

104
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:59,663
vessel approaching on an
intercept course, dead ahead.

105
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,671
What is this?

106
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,943
l'm... sorry, ma'am.

107
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:18,973
We were not informed
you'd left the station.

108
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:20,006
Who are you?

109
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,484
We were on standard patrol

110
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,148
when your vessel seemed
to appear out of nowhere.

111
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,951
lf you will allow
us to withdraw

112
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,152
we will escort you
back to the station.

113
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:43,702
l was as close to her
as l am to you.

114
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,004
She cannot be an impostor.

115
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:46,533
But she is.

116
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,884
What is going on here?

117
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,044
Garak!

118
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:58,044
Yes, my name is Garak.

119
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,818
The question is...

120
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,027
who...

121
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:05,029
are you?

122
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:07,479
This... may sound
like an odd question

123
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,046
but... could you tell us
where we are?

124
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:12,852
This is the Terok Nor station.

125
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,621
The center of authority
for the Bajoran Sector.

126
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,128
''Center of authority.''

127
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:20,131
Whose authority?

128
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:22,326
The Alliance, of course.

129
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,766
Something is very wrong here.

130
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:25,963
l think we took a wrong turn
in the wormhole.

131
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:27,130
Wormhole?

132
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,911
The wormhole to the Gamma...

133
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,511
lt's very difficult to explain.

134
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:33,774
l think it would be best

135
00:07:33,814 --> 00:07:35,782
if we just got back
to our ship and...

136
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:37,249
No!

137
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:38,308
l don't think so.

138
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:39,444
Now, wait a minute.

139
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:42,614
Don't take that tone
with us, Terran.

140
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:43,680
Terran?

141
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:45,954
lf you are
who l suspect you are

142
00:07:45,993 --> 00:07:49,451
l'm afraid l can't run the risk
of letting you go.

143
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:50,929
Take that one below.

144
00:07:50,964 --> 00:07:52,124
Put him to work.

145
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:55,100
Tell the supervisor
to keep an eye on him.

146
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,898
He won't know the rules.

147
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:11,147
Move, Terrans! Move!

148
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:14,086
lntendant!

149
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:17,749
What is it you need, Telok?

150
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,622
This Terran was caught
trying to stow away

151
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:20,683
on one of the freighters

152
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:23,093
leaving the station.

153
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,036
What is your designation?

154
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,233
0413-Theta.

155
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:34,240
Theta.

156
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:36,003
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:39,535
You worked so hard
to earn your theta designation

158
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:40,910
to earn our trust.

159
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:43,472
Why do you throw
it away like this?

160
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:45,246
Reassign him to Lambda.

161
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:46,912
Send him to the mines.

162
00:08:46,953 --> 00:08:48,682
The mines?
But he should die for this.

163
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:50,883
We should make
an example of him.

164
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:55,224
You have made a career
out of setting examples, Garak.

165
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:57,856
l think you enjoy it too much.

166
00:08:57,898 --> 00:09:00,958
He could never have gotten
on board that ship without help.

167
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:03,265
This is the third incident
in a month.

168
00:09:03,303 --> 00:09:05,863
At least, allow me
to interrogate him.

169
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:07,897
Fine.
lnterrogate him.

170
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:11,468
But if he dies
under your interrogation

171
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:13,877
l will make you my example.

172
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:15,211
ls that clear?

173
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:18,240
Very, lntendant.

174
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:27,790
l'm telling you.

175
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:29,989
lf you don't upgrade the
thorium containment cells

176
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,191
there's going to be an accident,
and l'm not going

177
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:33,961
to be responsible
for the consequences.

178
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:37,933
Another worker for you--

179
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:39,996
a Terran who doesn't know
the rules.

180
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,029
Well!

181
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:45,076
We'll see to it
that he learns them.

182
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:47,103
What's your designation?

183
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:49,047
Bashir, Julian.

184
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:50,982
ls that a joke?

185
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:53,144
l don't know.
ls it?

186
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:55,916
No jokes.

187
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:58,948
That's my Rule of Obedience
Number 14.

188
00:09:58,992 --> 00:10:01,756
Now, what's your designation?

189
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:04,423
l don't have a designation.

190
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:07,399
l don't have a designation,
sir.

191
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:08,958
Another Rule of Obedience?

192
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:13,070
l don't have a designation

193
00:10:13,106 --> 00:10:15,131
sir...

194
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:19,235
l don't have a designation, sir.

195
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,008
Now, why is that?

196
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:22,139
l don't know.

197
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:24,683
And frankly, l don't even know
what l'm doing here.

198
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:26,777
You're here to process ore.

199
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,254
Have you ever done that before?

200
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:30,984
No, l haven't.

201
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:33,151
Have you ever worked
in the mines?

202
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:34,158
No.

203
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:36,024
Then what have you done?

204
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:38,053
l've been practicing medicine.

205
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:43,797
Did you forget Rule of Obedience
Number 14?

206
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:45,668
lt's not a joke.

207
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:47,297
l am a doctor.

208
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,709
Well, Doctor, don't forget
to scrub before you operate.

209
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:21,900
Oh, sit down.

210
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:29,376
You are me, aren't you?

211
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,475
l am Kira Nerys.

212
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:33,383
That makes two of us.

213
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,149
Where you come from

214
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:39,124
things are very much
like this, aren't they?

215
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,617
There's a station,
a Bajor, Cardassians

216
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:44,027
Terrans, Klingons.

217
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:46,032
The players are all the same

218
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:49,502
but... everyone seems to be
playing different parts.

219
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:51,663
You didn't seem
to recognize the Alliance.

220
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:53,172
No.

221
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:56,698
Perhaps you'd recognize
the name Kirk.

222
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:59,268
No, l'm sorry, l don't.

223
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:00,609
lnteresting.

224
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:03,878
On my side, Kirk is one
of the most famous names

225
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,111
in our history.

226
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:09,882
Almost a century ago

227
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:14,792
a Terran starship captain
named James Kirk

228
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:16,455
accidentally exchanged places

229
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:18,464
with his counterpart
from your side

230
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:20,363
due to a transporter accident.

231
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,769
Our Terrans were
barbarians then

232
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:27,034
but their empire was strong.

233
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:29,439
While your Kirk
was on this side

234
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:31,034
he met a Vulcan named Spock

235
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:34,137
and somehow had
a profound influence on him.

236
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,081
Afterwards, Spock rose
to Commander in Chief

237
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:43,022
of the Empire by preaching
reforms, disarmament, peace.

238
00:12:43,056 --> 00:12:48,551
lt was quite a remarkable
turnabout for his people.

239
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,460
Unfortunately for them

240
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:53,898
when Spock had completed
all his reforms

241
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:57,334
his Empire was no longer
in any position

242
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,167
to defend itself against us.

243
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:00,466
Us?

244
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:03,999
The Alliance,
the historic coming-together

245
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:07,036
of the Klingons
and the Cardassians.

246
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,675
And Bajor is a part
of this Alliance?

247
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:13,686
We'd been under Terran
occupation for decades.

248
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,880
When we were freed

249
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:17,617
we petitioned
for entry and were accepted.

250
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:21,821
We have become quite
an influential power

251
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:23,419
within the Alliance.

252
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:26,626
ls it similar at all
on your side?

253
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,724
No.

254
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:30,429
My Bajor is not so fortunate.

255
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,303
l'd be very interested
to hear more about it.

256
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,365
l can't stay here.

257
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:37,467
You must see that.

258
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,606
Well, you see,
that's part of the problem.

259
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:44,947
l don't know
how to send you back.

260
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:47,680
But more than that...

261
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:51,047
there's a...

262
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:55,187
a certain protocol
l'm supposed to follow.

263
00:13:56,363 --> 00:13:58,331
l'm not sure what you mean.

264
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,428
After the first crossover

265
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:05,700
we were afraid others might come
to interfere in our affairs.

266
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:08,537
lt was decided then
that if it ever happened again

267
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:10,008
we would promptly dispose

268
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:12,944
of anyone who appeared
from your side.

269
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:14,880
l see.

270
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:18,505
Unlike my First Officer,
Mr. Garak

271
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,747
l have no taste for violence.

272
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:26,884
l regret using it,
even when it seems necessary.

273
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:29,951
l know exactly what you mean.

274
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,259
You do, don't you?

275
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:34,891
l know you don't want to kill me

276
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:38,630
and you're searching
for a good reason not to.

277
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:42,106
Got any ideas?

278
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:45,699
My side needs what you have--
a strong Bajor.

279
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:48,440
lf you knew the struggles
we've been through

280
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,777
to rebuild our world...

281
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:52,682
Who's to say you won't
influence us this time?

282
00:14:52,718 --> 00:14:54,049
Me?

283
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:56,884
My side once changed
the course of your history.

284
00:14:56,922 --> 00:15:00,016
Well, maybe this time
your side can change mine.

285
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:02,822
Maybe you can teach me
what l need to know

286
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,728
to become the leader
of Bajor, as you have.

287
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:07,527
That appeals to me.

288
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:09,431
lf l can find a way back.

289
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:12,403
But... l will have
to kill your friend.

290
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:13,404
No, don't.

291
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:14,598
lf you knew him...

292
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,197
He's an arrogant Terran

293
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:19,039
who's lived
a privileged life on my side.

294
00:15:19,077 --> 00:15:21,568
Let him see how
the other half lives.

295
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:23,080
No, it's too dangerous.

296
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:26,912
The Cardassians and the Klingons
would never allow it.

297
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:31,616
Are you the leader
of this sector or not?

298
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:35,323
Oh!

299
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,760
You know how to manipulate me.

300
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:40,356
l know how l'd feel
in your place.

301
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,991
l wouldn't give a damn

302
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:45,367
what the Cardassians
or the Klingons thought.

303
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,338
You're right.

304
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,501
l don't.

305
00:15:56,948 --> 00:15:58,472
Find this...

306
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:02,977
attractive young woman
some quarters.

307
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,522
Kira Nerys

308
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,721
l'll call for you later.

309
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:28,780
The lntendant informed me

310
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:31,009
you'd be inspecting
the facilities.

311
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:33,779
lf there's anything
l can explain...

312
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:36,447
No. l've worked
in ore processing, myself.

313
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:40,724
ls my Terran friend
behaving himself?

314
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,490
They all behave themselves
when l'm in charge.

315
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:46,190
Good.

316
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:49,325
Good. lf you don't mind,
l'll speak with him.

317
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:50,891
Huh?

318
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:51,903
Are you all right?

319
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:53,097
Learning a new trade.

320
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,638
Do you have any idea
what happened?

321
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:55,901
Have you ever heard

322
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:58,034
of a Starfleet Captain
named James Kirk?

323
00:16:58,076 --> 00:16:59,236
Kirk?!

324
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:02,440
Oh, of course--
the transporter accident.

325
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,448
Read about it at the Academy.

326
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,449
So, that's where we are.

327
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:05,609
That's where we are.

328
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,776
ls there another me here?

329
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:07,785
Not on this station.

330
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,150
l haven't found Dax or Sisko.

331
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:11,451
O'Brien's been tinkering around
with the machines.

332
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,980
Major, if Kirk got here
by transporter

333
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:14,787
do you think we could
get back the same way?

334
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,056
l don't know anything
about transporters. Do you?

335
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:18,722
Well, no one knows
more about transporters

336
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:19,821
than Chief O'Brien.

337
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:21,924
Well, our Chief O'Brien.
Who knows about theirs?

338
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,559
lt's worth a shot.

339
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:25,001
Talk to him.

340
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:26,003
l'll try to see if l can find

341
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:27,402
anyone else who might
be willing to help.

342
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,633
Yeah.

343
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,484
You certainly are the spitting
image of the lntendant...

344
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,516
just as they said.

345
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,357
Hello, Quark.

346
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:52,260
You know my name.

347
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:54,492
Quark runs a bar
on my side, too.

348
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,557
Really?

349
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,693
l hope l'm doing
decent business.

350
00:17:57,736 --> 00:17:59,499
Got to be better than here.

351
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:02,735
The Alliance taxes
are killing me.

352
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:04,036
What can l get you?

353
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:05,633
The lntendant likes
a hot <i>jumja</i> tea

354
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:06,644
this time of day.

355
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:08,703
Well, l'm not her

356
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:11,477
but that does sound good.

357
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:12,744
Coming up.

358
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:20,817
So, uh, are we close friends
on your side?

359
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:23,794
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, we are.

360
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:27,525
On my side, Quark does
me a lot of favors.

361
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,056
Favors?

362
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:30,328
The Quark l know...

363
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:32,063
well, he just has the ability

364
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:34,605
to get things done
when no one else can.

365
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:36,004
You know what l mean?

366
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,168
Sometimes he even
gets things done

367
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,735
behind the backs
of the security people.

368
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:42,770
What kind of favors
do you ask him for?

369
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:45,647
Oh, all sorts of favors, like...

370
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:47,345
getting me things l need...

371
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:48,579
Such as?

372
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,555
Well, for instance, a
transporter for a few hours.

373
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,649
Didn't l hear somewhere

374
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:59,255
that a transporter was involved
in the first crossover?

375
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:01,197
That's right.

376
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,398
Do you have a way back
to your side, Major?

377
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,466
Under the right circumstances,
l might be willing

378
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:13,977
to help you get access
to a transporter.

379
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:15,240
Look, Quark.

380
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,771
l don't have a strip
of gold-pressed latinum

381
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:19,443
so don't even think about it.

382
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:21,782
Gold-pressed what?

383
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,051
What is it you want?

384
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,288
The ability to send others
across to your side.

385
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:30,726
Others?
What others?

386
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:32,059
That's not important.

387
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:34,723
Look, l can't open
a revolving door to...

388
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:36,165
Quark!

389
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,601
Mr. Garak!

390
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:41,765
What can l get you today?

391
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,172
Drinks are always
on the house for you.

392
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,006
You must come with us.

393
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:48,069
ls there a problem?

394
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,511
Yes, a slight problem.

395
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:52,448
You've been helping Terrans
escape from the station.

396
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,952
Me? l'm a simple barkeep
and a coward.

397
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,318
l assure you, l don't stick
my neck out for anyone.

398
00:19:57,355 --> 00:20:00,381
That's not what the Terran
we caught this morning

399
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:02,450
told us during
his interrogation.

400
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,394
This is all a misunderstanding.

401
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:05,487
Hmm...

402
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,963
l assure you...

403
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:18,801
l shall miss him.

404
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,310
He always let me win at dabo.

405
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,312
Bartender!

406
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,472
He's just been arrested.

407
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:23,640
Arrested?

408
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,946
What a damned shame.

409
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:28,748
Who wants a drink on the house?

410
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:30,311
Here, l do!

411
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,583
Two!

412
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:34,520
Just give me the bottle.

413
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,117
Don't be stingy!

414
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:49,032
Here.

415
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,278
Miles O'Brien.

416
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:05,219
l know you, on my side.

417
00:21:05,256 --> 00:21:06,416
Yeah?

418
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,253
Actually, we're best friends.

419
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:12,047
You and me?

420
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:13,886
That's right.

421
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:17,292
What am l--
some kind of doctor, too?

422
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:19,661
No, you're Chief of Operations
of this station.

423
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:21,689
Me? Go on.

424
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,792
lt's true.

425
00:21:26,271 --> 00:21:28,739
Chief of Operations.

426
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:31,674
Looks like you know your way
around machines.

427
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,678
Well, l know some things.

428
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:37,580
What else is he like,
this Chief of Operations?

429
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:38,843
Ah, he's married.

430
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,544
He has a five-year-old daughter.

431
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:42,576
He's one of the most
decent men l know.

432
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,088
We fought our way
out of a few scrapes together.

433
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:46,488
l admire him a great deal.

434
00:21:46,524 --> 00:21:49,084
Sounds like he got
the lucky draw

435
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,185
between me and him.

436
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:57,096
Have you ever done much
work on transporters?

437
00:21:57,202 --> 00:21:58,226
Me?

438
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,100
Yeah, some.
Why?

439
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:01,969
Well, the Chief O'Brien l know

440
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:04,406
is an expert
in transporter technology.

441
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:06,467
l wouldn't call myself
an expert

442
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:08,570
but l know as much
as any Terran.

443
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:10,410
l hope that'll be enough.

444
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:11,574
Enough for what?

445
00:22:11,616 --> 00:22:13,345
We think that a transporter

446
00:22:13,385 --> 00:22:15,649
will help us get
back to our side.

447
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:17,211
What?

448
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:19,416
You're filling me up
with this stuff

449
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:21,823
just to get me to help you,
is that it?

450
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,851
No, everything
l've told you is the truth.

451
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:25,954
l don't know you.

452
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:28,488
l'm not your friend.

453
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:30,057
l'm not your friend!

454
00:22:30,135 --> 00:22:32,126
Meal break is over.

455
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:36,470
You're wanted in the bar.

456
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:39,002
Look, if l don't finish here...

457
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:42,206
You're wanted
in the bar by Mr. Sisko.

458
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:55,087
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

459
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,752
Yes.

460
00:22:57,762 --> 00:22:59,093
Look at this.

461
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,961
Do you believe it?

462
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:05,231
She called me all the way
from the Fowla system

463
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,931
to see you.

464
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:14,109
Not only do you look like her,
you have the same temper.

465
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,180
You and your friends
don't seem

466
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:19,581
like the other Terrans
l've seen here.

467
00:23:19,617 --> 00:23:23,212
The lntendant honors me
with a ship and a crew.

468
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:25,779
l honor her
by collecting duties--

469
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:32,419
of a sort-- from vessels
that pass in this direction.

470
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:35,922
And why do you deserve
this special treatment?

471
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:38,367
l suppose because l amuse her

472
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:41,770
and she's not easily amused.

473
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:46,072
And it seems
that you amuse her, too.

474
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:47,873
You wanted to see me, Mr. Sisko.

475
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:53,280
Hello, Smiley.

476
00:23:53,318 --> 00:23:54,615
How are you?

477
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:56,415
lt's Miles, Mr. Sisko.

478
00:23:56,454 --> 00:23:58,012
l don't like ''Miles.''

479
00:23:58,056 --> 00:24:00,490
That's why l named you Smiley.

480
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:03,392
Are they treating you okay,
Smiley?

481
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:04,622
Just fine.

482
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:06,721
What do you need?

483
00:24:06,764 --> 00:24:10,222
You don't like me,
do you, Smiley?

484
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:12,327
Not really, Mr. Sisko.

485
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:17,468
Ah, and you're not afraid
to show it, are you?

486
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:20,034
l suppose that's why
l like you so much.

487
00:24:20,111 --> 00:24:22,944
My impulse driver coil
isn't operational.

488
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:24,039
Take care of it.

489
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:25,412
l've got a serious problem

490
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,611
in ore processing
that's got to be fixed...

491
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:31,782
l don't care what's going on
in ore processing.

492
00:24:31,823 --> 00:24:33,450
Fix my engine.

493
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:34,856
Hmm?

494
00:24:37,128 --> 00:24:38,925
Kira to Sisko.

495
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:40,760
Go ahead.

496
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:42,663
l'd like to discuss
your recent mission.

497
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,362
Would you please report
to my quarters?

498
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:09,719
There she is.

499
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:12,229
Have you met my friend,
Benjamin Sisko, my dear?

500
00:25:16,668 --> 00:25:18,602
Tell us--

501
00:25:18,636 --> 00:25:22,037
is there another one
of him on your side?

502
00:25:22,073 --> 00:25:24,598
Yes, there is.

503
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:27,372
ls he as loyal and true as mine?

504
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,307
He's a good man.

505
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:32,748
Oh, l'm sorry he didn't
come with you.

506
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:36,015
Wouldn't that have been
something, Benjamin?

507
00:25:36,054 --> 00:25:37,646
Two of you by my side.

508
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:39,316
l need to check my ship.

509
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:40,346
Benjamin!

510
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,021
Did l hurt your feelings?

511
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:47,964
l never had any to hurt,
lntendant.

512
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:58,267
Now, what is this l hear
about you wanting a transporter?

513
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:01,039
Quark mentioned something
about it

514
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,774
during his interrogation.

515
00:26:02,814 --> 00:26:05,977
l did ask him about
a transporter, that's true.

516
00:26:06,017 --> 00:26:07,314
But why?

517
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:09,582
Well, you know l'm looking
for a way back.

518
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:12,181
A transporter was responsible
for the first crossover.

519
00:26:12,223 --> 00:26:15,158
And if you had come to me,
l would have told you

520
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:17,821
all transporters
were redesigned afterwards

521
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:21,127
to make sure the same thing
would never happen again.

522
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:23,463
lt won't work.

523
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:27,028
So... why didn't you come to me?

524
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:29,164
You're very busy.

525
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:34,167
You don't trust me.

526
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:38,649
l'm... a little afraid of you.

527
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:40,844
Then you fear yourself.

528
00:26:40,885 --> 00:26:43,479
l don't want your fear.

529
00:26:43,521 --> 00:26:45,648
l want your love.

530
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,750
lf you can't love me, who can?

531
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:51,891
Don't be in such a hurry to go.

532
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:53,191
l'm glad you're here.

533
00:26:53,231 --> 00:26:56,257
There is so much we can learn
from one another.

534
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,930
lntendant, Garak is here
with the prisoner.

535
00:27:00,972 --> 00:27:02,234
Send him in.

536
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:07,171
He's made a full confession

537
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:10,476
and implicated two others,
who have been arrested.

538
00:27:15,486 --> 00:27:17,147
Quark.

539
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:22,960
l have always liked you,
you know that.

540
00:27:22,994 --> 00:27:26,794
l have nothing but respect
for you, lntendant.

541
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:28,628
l'm so sorry.

542
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:30,930
You did it because you felt
sorry for these Terrans.

543
00:27:30,968 --> 00:27:34,631
You hate to see them suffer,
just as l do.

544
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:35,969
Yes, lntendant.

545
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:38,805
But where would we be
without them?

546
00:27:38,843 --> 00:27:42,506
Who would perform the labor
for the Alliance?

547
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:46,150
A quick death.

548
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:48,448
Don't make him suffer anymore.

549
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:50,283
No, lntendant, please.

550
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:52,653
l made a mistake.
Have mercy!

551
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,180
No, please!

552
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:57,126
l've planned a party
for us tonight.

553
00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:00,063
What shall we wear?

554
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:07,395
Lovely.

555
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:10,737
l do admire
a well-tailored gown.

556
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:13,369
What are you doing
in my quarters, Garak?

557
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:16,278
She'll never let you leave,
you know.

558
00:28:16,314 --> 00:28:17,474
Can't you tell?

559
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:18,709
She's in love.

560
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,217
What are you talking about?

561
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:22,276
ln love with you, my dear.

562
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,618
She's all atwitter about you.

563
00:28:24,655 --> 00:28:27,556
Can't talk about anyone else.

564
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:30,390
You're the perfect gift
for the girl who has everything.

565
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:32,658
She's taken you into her heart

566
00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:37,157
like a Drathan puppy lig
left on her doorstep.

567
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:41,035
Who else could she share
her deepest secrets with

568
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:45,974
tell her troubles to,
trust with her life?

569
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,377
All you have to do is take
a look at the guard outside

570
00:28:49,413 --> 00:28:51,313
to see how much she trusts me.

571
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:52,907
l arranged the guard.

572
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,918
Oh, she trusts you.

573
00:28:54,952 --> 00:28:57,978
As much as she trusts anyone.

574
00:28:58,022 --> 00:29:00,991
So, who better to betray her?

575
00:29:01,025 --> 00:29:04,791
You're taking quite a risk
coming to me like this.

576
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:08,526
True career advancement
requires risk.

577
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:12,161
Consider my offer carefully,
my dear.

578
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:14,603
She'll never let you go.

579
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,434
l will.

580
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:18,592
lf you want to leave,
you'll assist me.

581
00:29:18,636 --> 00:29:19,864
How?

582
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:21,633
By taking her place.

583
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,799
What?

584
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:26,275
Tomorrow morning,
she will be gone.

585
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:28,703
Gone?

586
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:30,008
She will be gone.

587
00:29:30,114 --> 00:29:34,016
Please, don't make me use
some foolish euphemism.

588
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:37,919
You will assume her place
as lntendant and announce

589
00:29:37,955 --> 00:29:40,583
that your counterpart
from the other side

590
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:43,116
has returned
to wherever she came from.

591
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,958
ln a few weeks,
you will step down

592
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:48,693
to embark on a spiritual journey

593
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:51,463
to explore your <i>pagh</i>
or whatever.

594
00:29:51,502 --> 00:29:56,804
And l will take your place
as lntendant.

595
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:58,274
What about my friend?

596
00:29:58,309 --> 00:29:59,435
The good Doctor.

597
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:02,275
Yes, he'll be taken off
the station

598
00:30:02,313 --> 00:30:05,510
and treated
to as much hospitality

599
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,714
as we Cardassians can offer
until you resign.

600
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:13,281
And then you can be
happily reunited.

601
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:19,561
Oh, l've made arrangements
with his supervisor

602
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:23,897
that, if you should decide
to decline my offer

603
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:27,598
tomorrow, it will be
your Doctor friend

604
00:30:27,638 --> 00:30:29,367
who will be gone.

605
00:30:45,623 --> 00:30:46,954
We've got to get out
of here tonight.

606
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:48,253
Why?
What's happened?

607
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:49,452
l don't have time to explain.

608
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:51,085
Just watch your back.
You're in danger.

609
00:30:51,128 --> 00:30:52,186
Why my back?
What kind of danger?

610
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:53,753
We've got to find a way
back to the runabout.

611
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:54,765
And then where do we go?

612
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,096
The Alliance controls
the entire Quadrant.

613
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,292
There's still
a wormhole out there

614
00:30:57,335 --> 00:30:58,461
they don't know anything about.

615
00:30:58,502 --> 00:31:00,595
Now, l'm not sure whether
it'll get us back or not.

616
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,163
All l know is,
we can't stay here any longer.

617
00:31:03,207 --> 00:31:04,970
How are we supposed to get
past their security?

618
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:07,239
l'm trying to find some help.

619
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:09,405
l've heard Quark has helped
some Terrans escape.

620
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:10,641
No, it's too late for Quark.

621
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:11,739
Stay alert.

622
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:14,410
lf our chance comes,
there won't be much warning.

623
00:31:31,435 --> 00:31:33,630
Sisko.

624
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:36,299
Tell her l'm busy.

625
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,706
l have something
important to tell you.

626
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:41,234
l'm listening.

627
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:48,643
l have valuable information

628
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:51,314
and l want something
in exchange.

629
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:53,619
You've gone into business
for yourself, have you?

630
00:31:53,658 --> 00:31:56,957
All l want is to get
off this station.

631
00:31:56,994 --> 00:31:59,656
l want my runabout back.

632
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,025
And you expect me to help you?

633
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:06,832
She'll have my head.

634
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:09,836
Or something else.

635
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:12,802
Not if you save her life.

636
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:14,037
Her life?

637
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:17,842
Garak is planning
to kill her-- tonight.

638
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,144
That's it?

639
00:32:20,184 --> 00:32:22,550
That's the valuable information?

640
00:32:22,586 --> 00:32:26,989
Garak has been trying to kill
her since the day he got here.

641
00:32:27,024 --> 00:32:29,424
He wants me to take her place.

642
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,189
Well, now...

643
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:35,187
that's more creative
than he usually gets.

644
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:39,935
l wouldn't worry about it.

645
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:45,239
What kind of a man are you?

646
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:47,335
You're disturbing my nap.

647
00:32:47,378 --> 00:32:52,179
The Benjamin Sisko l know
would never sell his soul

648
00:32:52,216 --> 00:32:55,083
and allow himself to become
part of this tyranny

649
00:32:55,152 --> 00:32:56,676
against his own people.

650
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,086
Terrans don't have souls.

651
00:32:58,155 --> 00:32:59,247
We don't believe in them.

652
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,814
Well, what do
Terrans believe in?

653
00:33:00,858 --> 00:33:01,984
Raising their children

654
00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:04,392
to dig ore out of the mines
for the Alliance?

655
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:06,623
l worked in the mines, too,
till l was old enough

656
00:33:06,664 --> 00:33:08,154
to start fighting
for my freedom.

657
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,531
What do you care
about Terrans' freedom?

658
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:12,502
l care about freedom.

659
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:16,131
What l don't understand
is why you don't care.

660
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:18,403
Why the only one
on this station l have met

661
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:21,434
who seemed to give a damn
was a Ferengi toad named Quark.

662
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:25,438
You're looking in the wrong
place for a hero, ma'am.

663
00:33:25,483 --> 00:33:29,385
l've made the best
of a bad life for my crew.

664
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,445
That's my contribution.

665
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:36,449
Yes, you charmed
your way out of the mines

666
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:38,894
but you and l both know

667
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:42,365
you're no less a victim
than anyone else here.

668
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,447
My dear...

669
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:10,783
how breathtaking
you look tonight.

670
00:34:10,828 --> 00:34:14,696
l do hope you'll
save a dance for me

671
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:16,495
later this evening.

672
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:21,767
After four years
as a personal guard

673
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:23,239
for the House of Duras

674
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:26,300
l was ready to do anything
to get out of there.

675
00:34:26,343 --> 00:34:28,811
You never knew if Lursa
and B'Etor were going to be...

676
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:31,337
Clumsy fool!

677
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:35,914
Stupid Terran pig.

678
00:34:47,097 --> 00:34:50,157
What's wrong, Terran?

679
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,601
Lost your nerve?

680
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:56,128
Afraid to die today, eh?

681
00:35:00,644 --> 00:35:03,135
Get out of my sight.

682
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:11,445
The lntendant!

683
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,457
lntendant, you look lovely.

684
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:18,291
lntendant,
what is your pleasure?

685
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:20,957
Play something bright.

686
00:35:20,998 --> 00:35:23,057
l'm in a happy mood.

687
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:44,852
You're not accustomed
to this workload

688
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:46,948
are you, Doctor?

689
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:49,551
You have much to learn.

690
00:35:49,593 --> 00:35:52,494
lt's a shame
this is going to be

691
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:54,554
your last night on the job.

692
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,759
Engineering, we have
a thorium leak down here!

693
00:36:00,804 --> 00:36:04,110
Release the security locks!

694
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,789
Establish security fields

695
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:24,295
on all the levels
above and below.

696
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,764
Station guards
at all turbolifts.

697
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:28,096
Okay, over here.

698
00:36:28,134 --> 00:36:29,465
This way!

699
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:31,129
He must have gone
below the deck...

700
00:36:32,471 --> 00:36:35,531
You three in back,
come with me.

701
00:36:57,063 --> 00:36:58,496
O'Brien.

702
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:03,365
You've got to help me.

703
00:37:03,402 --> 00:37:04,494
l don't see you.

704
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:06,164
You're not here.

705
00:37:06,205 --> 00:37:07,968
l'm just trying to seal

706
00:37:08,074 --> 00:37:09,701
this thorium leak.

707
00:37:09,742 --> 00:37:13,200
Look, l don't know my way around
these conduits, but you do.

708
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:14,508
My O'Brien does.

709
00:37:14,547 --> 00:37:15,980
Uh-uh.

710
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:17,879
Just tell me where
the runabout pads are.

711
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:19,214
l know you, Miles O'Brien.

712
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:21,584
Somewhere inside of you,
there is a shred of decency.

713
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:22,713
There has to be.

714
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:24,882
l am a decent man.

715
00:37:24,924 --> 00:37:28,223
l just... l just...

716
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:29,990
You don't understand.

717
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:32,223
l can't help you.
l can't.

718
00:37:32,265 --> 00:37:33,596
They'll kill me.

719
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:35,362
You're already dead.

720
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:37,892
l'm sorry you don't see that.

721
00:37:37,937 --> 00:37:41,373
The life inside
every human being here--

722
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:44,501
every Terran--
died a long time ago.

723
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:47,673
That's not the right way.

724
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:55,020
Just tell me one thing.

725
00:37:55,121 --> 00:37:58,022
ls there room
on your ship for me?

726
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:00,251
You want us to take you with us?

727
00:38:00,293 --> 00:38:02,261
l have no reason to stay here.

728
00:38:02,295 --> 00:38:06,527
Starfleet would probably have
a big problem with that.

729
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:08,795
To hell with them.
Let's go.

730
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:25,751
Stop right there!

731
00:38:30,923 --> 00:38:32,481
lntendant.

732
00:38:35,361 --> 00:38:37,955
The new Terran killed
the shape-shifter

733
00:38:37,997 --> 00:38:40,557
and O'Brien tried
to help him escape.

734
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:49,673
This is my fault
for listening to you.

735
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:52,974
For keeping him alive
in the first place.

736
00:38:56,782 --> 00:39:01,242
l know very little
about where you come from

737
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:03,812
but, from what l've heard

738
00:39:03,856 --> 00:39:07,690
l think your kind
has a lot to learn.

739
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:09,558
We've got a lot to learn?

740
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:11,358
What a laugh.

741
00:39:11,397 --> 00:39:13,228
Quiet!

742
00:39:15,034 --> 00:39:20,973
On this side,
Terran workers do not speak

743
00:39:21,006 --> 00:39:23,372
to their superiors
as you do.

744
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:26,242
They certainly
do not murder them.

745
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,350
He was the only one
of his kind...

746
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:34,114
the man you killed.

747
00:39:34,153 --> 00:39:35,484
Do you realize that?

748
00:39:35,521 --> 00:39:38,422
He is irreplaceable.

749
00:39:38,457 --> 00:39:42,826
No one ran that operation
as efficiently as he did.

750
00:39:42,862 --> 00:39:45,490
No one kept order
among the workers as he did.

751
00:39:50,936 --> 00:39:52,836
This is my reward...

752
00:39:52,872 --> 00:39:58,139
for treating you Terrans
with the least bit of respect.

753
00:39:58,177 --> 00:40:00,008
Very well.

754
00:40:02,114 --> 00:40:05,015
l can learn from my mistakes.

755
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,984
You want to set an example,
Garak.

756
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:07,986
Use him.

757
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,181
Set an example for all Terrans.

758
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:13,749
Let him die, slowly, in public
view on the Promenade.

759
00:40:13,793 --> 00:40:17,320
Let his pleas for mercy
echo through the corridors

760
00:40:17,363 --> 00:40:18,557
for all Terrans to hear.

761
00:40:18,597 --> 00:40:19,859
lntendant...

762
00:40:19,899 --> 00:40:24,302
Another word from you, and you
will die right beside him.

763
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:28,467
And you...

764
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:31,777
O'Brien...

765
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:38,182
you tinkerer and putterer
and fixer of broken things

766
00:40:38,217 --> 00:40:41,675
you've been
the perfect theta for years.

767
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,281
What could possibly
have gotten into you?

768
00:40:45,324 --> 00:40:47,417
What were you thinking?

769
00:40:49,595 --> 00:40:52,223
Do you want an answer,
lntendant?

770
00:40:52,264 --> 00:40:54,095
Yes.

771
00:40:56,268 --> 00:40:58,236
This man...

772
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:04,732
this man is a doctor
where he comes from

773
00:41:04,777 --> 00:41:08,144
and there's an O'Brien there,
just like me

774
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,583
except he's some kind
of high-up Chief of Operations.

775
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:14,813
They're Terrans.

776
00:41:14,854 --> 00:41:17,789
Can you believe that?

777
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:22,355
Maybe it's a fairy tale
he made up

778
00:41:22,394 --> 00:41:24,328
but it started me thinking

779
00:41:24,363 --> 00:41:28,493
how... how each of us
might have turned out

780
00:41:28,534 --> 00:41:30,968
if history had been
just a little different.

781
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:37,600
l wanted him
to take me with him

782
00:41:37,643 --> 00:41:43,013
because, whatever it's like
where he's from

783
00:41:43,048 --> 00:41:45,642
it's got to be better than this.

784
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:50,848
There's got to be something
better than this.

785
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,053
Not for you, Mr. O'Brien.

786
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,061
Oh, he's going to be
taking you with him...

787
00:41:58,097 --> 00:42:03,535
just not exactly where you
thought he would be taking you.

788
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:12,873
No, l don't think so.

789
00:42:15,047 --> 00:42:17,277
Have you lost your mind?

790
00:42:18,784 --> 00:42:20,012
No.

791
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:22,383
l didn't lose it.

792
00:42:22,421 --> 00:42:25,288
l just... changed it.

793
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,697
Go, go!

794
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:44,874
She's never going
to let you get away.

795
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,037
She'll track you down
no matter how long it takes.

796
00:42:47,112 --> 00:42:48,875
You may want to consider
following us back to our side.

797
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:49,881
l've got the feeling

798
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,382
l might not fit in
very well over there.

799
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:53,385
We'll stay one step
ahead of the law.

800
00:42:53,419 --> 00:42:54,579
Don't worry about us.

801
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,554
Maybe we can stir up
some things on this side.

802
00:42:56,589 --> 00:42:58,386
You're still welcome
to come with us.

803
00:42:58,424 --> 00:42:59,686
l might have something
to stay for now.

804
00:42:59,725 --> 00:43:01,317
if you have room on your ship
for me, Mr. Sisko.

805
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,385
l can always use
a good tinkerer and putterer.

806
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:04,453
You're with me, Smiley.

807
00:43:04,496 --> 00:43:05,656
Good luck.

808
00:43:05,698 --> 00:43:07,893
Thank you.

809
00:43:10,903 --> 00:43:12,996
Disengage the docking clamps.

810
00:43:13,105 --> 00:43:14,231
Confirmed.

811
00:43:14,273 --> 00:43:15,240
Firing thrusters.

812
00:43:15,274 --> 00:43:16,332
Thrusters engaged.

813
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,138
Taking us straight to impulse.

814
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:19,610
lmpulse engines on line.

815
00:43:23,649 --> 00:43:24,911
45 seconds to the wormhole.

816
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,645
l'm still reading
a plasma injector leak

817
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:27,652
from the warp core.

818
00:43:27,686 --> 00:43:28,653
Yeah, l'm hoping that leak

819
00:43:28,687 --> 00:43:29,813
takes us back
where we came from.

820
00:43:29,855 --> 00:43:30,981
l'm matching
speeds and attitude

821
00:43:31,023 --> 00:43:32,047
with our last time through.

822
00:43:33,258 --> 00:43:36,716
Klingon cruiser approaching.

823
00:43:36,762 --> 00:43:39,424
Shields are down to 60 percent.

824
00:43:39,465 --> 00:43:41,262
Forty.

825
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,961
Ten seconds to the wormhole.

826
00:43:44,136 --> 00:43:45,034
We're hit.

827
00:43:45,137 --> 00:43:46,126
Hold on.

828
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:58,550
Anything?

829
00:43:58,584 --> 00:43:59,676
The search vessels

830
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:01,481
picked up
their warp signature traces.

831
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,080
There was also
an indication of a plasma leak.

832
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:05,090
But no wreckage?

833
00:44:05,124 --> 00:44:06,250
Nothing.

834
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,690
Reading elevated neutrinos.

835
00:44:07,726 --> 00:44:09,717
Something's coming
through the wormhole.

836
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:11,252
l can't believe it.
lt's them.

837
00:44:11,296 --> 00:44:12,524
Benjamin.

838
00:44:12,564 --> 00:44:14,429
They're showing damage
to their deflector grids.

839
00:44:14,466 --> 00:44:16,491
Put them on screen, Mr. O'Brien.

840
00:44:16,535 --> 00:44:18,594
We've got ships
from here to New Bajor

841
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:20,002
out looking for you.

842
00:44:20,105 --> 00:44:21,572
Where have you been?

843
00:44:22,574 --> 00:44:25,907
Through the looking
glass, Commander.

844
00:44:25,944 --> 00:44:28,495
lt's good to be back.
