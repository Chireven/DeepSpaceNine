1
00:00:06,398 --> 00:00:07,956
And l've downloaded

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,968
the new docking procedure
checklist for Bay 6

3
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,162
into the Bay-Prod D-9 file.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,171
That's the only bay
using the new criteria.

5
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:15,503
Got it.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,531
And be sure to monitor
the power fluctuations

7
00:00:17,576 --> 00:00:19,009
in the secondary fusion core.

8
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:21,672
lt's got some little kinks in
there l don't like the look of.

9
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:23,442
l will care for the
secondary fusion core

10
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,506
like it was my own child.

11
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:26,346
As soon as l get back,
l'm going to run

12
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:28,512
a full diagnostic,
to make sure there's no...

13
00:00:28,553 --> 00:00:29,918
Chief! We are perfectly capable

14
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:32,082
of running this place
by ourselves for a week.

15
00:00:32,124 --> 00:00:34,456
Well, if you have any problems
you can reach me on subspace...

16
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:38,259
Would you please go on vacation
and get out of our hair?

17
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:43,368
Miles.

18
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:44,369
Yeah?

19
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:46,598
Have a good time.

20
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:47,696
Oh, right.

21
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:49,206
Thanks, yeah.

22
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:51,766
l feel relaxed already.

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,708
ls he gone?

24
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:58,215
Finally.

25
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:00,308
Good. He's been driving me
crazy all day.

26
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,649
You'd think that l was...

27
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,086
Commander...

28
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:04,088
l forgot to tell you.

29
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:05,146
l added a new subroutine

30
00:01:05,257 --> 00:01:07,316
to the environmental control
in the Habitat Ring...

31
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,485
Chief O'Brien.

32
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,994
Yes, sir?

33
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,495
You're on leave.

34
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,430
Please disembark this station.

35
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:15,558
Aye, sir.

36
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:25,609
lt's okay.

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,370
Boone!

38
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:31,609
O'Brien.

39
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,617
Miles O'Brien.

40
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:34,050
We served together
on the <i>Rutledge.</i>

41
00:01:34,086 --> 00:01:35,348
Of course! O'Brien.

42
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,184
Oh, it's been a long time.

43
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,450
How are you doing?

44
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,787
l'm fine, just fine.

45
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:42,419
l work on this station now.
Chief Engineer.

46
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:43,553
ls that a fact?

47
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:45,187
Yeah. How long you been
out of Starfleet?

48
00:01:45,263 --> 00:01:47,288
Oh, about eight years now.
l settled on Volon lll.

49
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:48,890
Well, that's
on the Cardassian side

50
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,561
of the Demilitarized Zone,
isn't it?

51
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:53,662
Yes. Well, the new treaty, it
really puts us in harm's way.

52
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:55,332
But l run a ladarium
mining sluice

53
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:57,467
so as long as the Cardassians
need ladarium

54
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,602
for their warp drives,
they leave me alone.

55
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:02,442
Well, after what we went
through in the border wars

56
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:04,745
l don't know
how you can live there.

57
00:02:04,783 --> 00:02:06,478
You were there at Setlik lll.

58
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:08,110
That's what got me
out of Starfleet.

59
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:11,020
Really?
That's why l stayed in.

60
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:12,648
Listen, my wife
is waiting for me

61
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,625
and she hates it when l'm late,
and l always am.

62
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:15,785
l'm coming back

63
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:17,351
for another supply pickup
in a month or two.

64
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:18,488
Okay, let me know when.

65
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,383
O'Brien, Miles O'Brien.

66
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,648
We served together
on the <i>Rutledge.</i>

67
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:45,940
Miles?

68
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:47,103
Uh-huh?

69
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:49,045
Didn't you bring the holo-cam?

70
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,707
Was l supposed to?

71
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,614
You said you were going to.

72
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,585
Did l?

73
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:58,180
Last night, when we were
going over the list in bed.

74
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,723
Not me.

75
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,852
l was dead as soon as my head
hit the pillow.

76
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:05,590
You talked to me
for half an hour.

77
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,498
No, there must have been
someone else in bed with us.

78
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:14,866
What's this?

79
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:17,739
Oh, just some new
technical update manuals.

80
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,006
Our first vacation
in five years

81
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:22,946
and you brought
technical update manuals?

82
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:26,280
You know, maybe we should
have brought Molly with us.

83
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:29,253
Do you think she'll be okay
with the Petersons?

84
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,450
She likes the Petersons
more than she likes us.

85
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,048
She's fine.

86
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:38,290
We could swing back, pick up
the holo-cam and Molly

87
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,764
and still only lose
about half a day.

88
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,926
Or we could pick up
the holo-cam

89
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,300
when we get there.

90
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,703
How many did you bring?

91
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:49,172
What?

92
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,539
Tech update manuals?

93
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:54,340
Just a few.

94
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:06,157
Computer, play something
by... Minezaki.

95
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:50,165
Do these chairs recline?

96
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,032
l wish they did.

97
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,560
You're an engineer.

98
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:55,163
Do something about it.

99
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,401
l'll make it worth your while.

100
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:58,670
Mmm...

101
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,109
Vessel approaching.

102
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:03,273
Bearing 191 mark 6.

103
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:05,714
ldentify.

104
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,843
Cardassian patrol ship,
Hideki-class.

105
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:10,721
Shields up!

106
00:07:18,593 --> 00:07:21,994
Try to send an emergency
subspace signal to the station.

107
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,691
l... l can't.

108
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:25,632
They're jamming all
subspace frequencies.

109
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:26,827
They're hailing us.

110
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,570
This is Miles O'Brien
of Starbase Deep Space 9.

111
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,097
State your business.

112
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:35,973
Mr. O'Brien,
we've spoken before.

113
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:37,308
My name is Evek.

114
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:39,939
Shut down your drive,
and come to a full stop.

115
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:42,245
We're beaming
an inspection team aboard.

116
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:44,081
We're nowhere near
the Cardassian border.

117
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,711
You've no authority here.

118
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:47,619
We'll argue
about authority later.

119
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:49,146
For now,
you will either comply

120
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:50,885
or we will take
preemptive action.

121
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:52,587
Warning.

122
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:55,289
Sensors are reading
photo lock-on activation.

123
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,059
You have ten seconds.

124
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:01,825
Don't worry.

125
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,565
We haven't done anything.

126
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:06,568
Thank you
for your cooperation.

127
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:08,599
l have orders to arrest you,
Mr. O'Brien.

128
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:09,610
Arrest?

129
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:10,611
Search the ship.

130
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:12,044
What are the charges?

131
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,911
You have the right to refuse
to answer questions

132
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:16,474
but such refusal may be
construed as a sign of guilt.

133
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:19,316
l demand to know
what l'm being accused of.

134
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:21,754
You deny all knowledge
of this crime, then?

135
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,621
How the hell am l supposed
to deny something

136
00:08:23,658 --> 00:08:25,523
when l don't know what
you're talking about?

137
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,584
So you do not
deny all knowledge?

138
00:08:26,628 --> 00:08:29,461
We are Federation citizens
and we have rights.

139
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:31,021
Yes, yes, all your rights

140
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:34,092
as defined by Cardassian
Articles of Jurisprudence

141
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:35,227
will be protected.

142
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,637
l demand to speak
to my Commander.

143
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:40,971
We will contact your Commander

144
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:42,101
and see that your wife

145
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:43,940
is returned safely
to your station.

146
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,379
You will be taken
to Central Prison

147
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:48,109
on Cardassia Prime
to await trial.

148
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,344
All right.

149
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:52,751
l'm not going anywhere with you.

150
00:08:52,787 --> 00:08:56,723
Miles!
Miles!

151
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,152
No!

152
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:06,896
Miles!
Miles!

153
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:12,739
Look to the children.

154
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:15,572
They are the future
of Cardassia

155
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,238
and they will lead the way.

156
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,112
lnvest in their minds.

157
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:22,911
Teach them carefully...

158
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:28,522
Remove your clothes.

159
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:33,724
My name's Miles O'Brien.

160
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:36,560
My rank, Chief of Operations,
Starfleet.

161
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:39,396
l'm a Federation citizen.

162
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:41,026
Remove your clothes.

163
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:44,133
My name is Miles O'Brien.

164
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:46,834
My rank is Chief of Operations,
Starfleet.

165
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,342
l'm a Federation citizen.

166
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:06,750
Would you care to make
a confession?

167
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:10,494
My name is Miles O'Brien.

168
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:13,592
My rank is Chief of Operations,
Starfleet.

169
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:16,035
l am a citizen
of the Federation!

170
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:17,595
Process him.

171
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:56,376
My name is...

172
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:58,208
Miles...

173
00:10:58,246 --> 00:11:00,646
O'Brien.

174
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:06,919
My rank is...

175
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:10,823
Chief of...

176
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:17,190
Operations...

177
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:33,811
Has he been processed?

178
00:11:33,848 --> 00:11:35,213
He has.

179
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:43,353
You were told he was
not to be harmed.

180
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:44,653
He had to be restrained.

181
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:45,886
Bring him his clothing.

182
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,491
l apologize for the way

183
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:55,901
you've been treated,
Mr. O'Brien.

184
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:59,338
l'm Makbar, Chief Archon.

185
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:01,001
l want your stay here

186
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:03,101
to be as comfortable
as possible

187
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:04,771
under the circumstances.

188
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:08,840
l've scheduled your trial
to begin in two days.

189
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:11,443
You've been assigned
the venerable Kovat

190
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:13,078
as public conservator.

191
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:14,145
As what?

192
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:15,520
Your lawyer.

193
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:18,822
Many feel that he's the best
counsel in all Cardassia.

194
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,590
What do l need a lawyer for?

195
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:23,824
What am l charged with?

196
00:12:23,865 --> 00:12:25,457
Who's accusing me?

197
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,527
All in good time, Mr. O'Brien.

198
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:31,596
All in good time.

199
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:42,511
Starfleet has ordered
the <i>Enterprise</i>

200
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,450
the <i>Proko</i>fi<i>ev</i>
and the <i>Valdemar</i>

201
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:46,316
to the border
of the Demilitarized Zone.

202
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:48,015
Hopefully,
when the Cardassians see

203
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:50,183
that they are risking the
entire treaty over this...

204
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,385
ln the meantime, my husband
is being violated by them.

205
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:55,623
Every shred of his humanity
is being violated.

206
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:57,028
lsn't that true?

207
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:58,657
We don't know exactly...

208
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,031
Damn it!
Don't lie to me!

209
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:02,832
They're torturing him
as we sit here.

210
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:05,601
lt is standard procedure
for the Cardassians

211
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,074
to use torture
in their interrogations.

212
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:09,667
You are correct, Mrs. O'Brien.

213
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:15,544
You don't know how many times
Miles spoke to me about this--

214
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,641
what the Cardassians did

215
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:18,549
to the prisoners
they took at Setlik lll.

216
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:21,248
What they were like
when they came back.

217
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:24,315
The thought of it,
it disgusted him.

218
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,519
lt scared him.

219
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,755
We can't leave him there.

220
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:31,492
We don't even know where he's
being held on Cardassia Prime.

221
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:37,283
Keiko, l promise you

222
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,015
as soon as we have
more information

223
00:13:39,055 --> 00:13:41,250
l'll do everything
in my power to...

224
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,121
Commander, you have
a subspace transmission

225
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,148
from Cardassia Prime.

226
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:47,359
On screen.

227
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:53,927
l'm Benjamin Sisko,
Commander of Deep Space 9.

228
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:55,664
My name is Makbar.

229
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:58,697
l'm the Archon representing
the Cardassian Empire

230
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:01,141
in its case
against Miles O'Brien.

231
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:02,542
May l speak with him?

232
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:04,068
That is not possible.

233
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:04,943
May l see him?

234
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,174
-Commander...
-May l be assured

235
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,080
that he is well
and being treated properly?

236
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:12,712
Mr. O'Brien is being treated
with great care and respect.

237
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:14,313
Good, because if he is not

238
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:16,587
l will hold you
personally responsible.

239
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,321
And if that sounds
like a threat, it is.

240
00:14:19,362 --> 00:14:22,092
Gul Dukat's told me about you.

241
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:25,964
You live up
to your reputation, Commander.

242
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:27,491
That's right, l do.

243
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:30,767
Now, what are the charges
against Chief O'Brien?

244
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:33,900
The charges will be announced
when the trial begins

245
00:14:33,943 --> 00:14:36,639
as is customary
in Cardassian jurisprudence.

246
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,806
How can we prepare
for the trial

247
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:40,816
if we don't know the charges?

248
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,841
Mrs. O'Brien, l take it?

249
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:44,113
Yes.

250
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,949
Mrs. O'Brien, there's nothing
for you to prepare.

251
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:48,582
Your husband's verdict
has already been determined.

252
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:49,591
He is guilty.

253
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,320
The trial will reveal

254
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,352
how this guilt was proven
by the most efficient

255
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:57,264
criminal investigation system
in the Quadrant.

256
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:00,860
You may, if you desire,
attend this trial, which begins

257
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:02,370
in two days' time.

258
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:03,872
We'll be there.

259
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:05,271
Oh, l'm sorry, Commander.

260
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:06,797
This is a privilege

261
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:09,777
enjoyed solely by the spouse
of an offender.

262
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:11,211
What about his nestor?

263
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:15,047
His counsel and his nestor
will be assigned by the court.

264
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:16,608
Nestor?

265
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:18,449
Advisor to the offender.

266
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:22,583
Madam Archon, l volunteer to
serve as nestor in this trial.

267
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,217
That is not possible.

268
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,524
The nestor must be
an officer of the court.

269
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:28,462
l am an officer of the court.

270
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:29,987
Chief of Security Odo.

271
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:33,661
l served Gul Dukat on Terok Nor.

272
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:35,260
You may check my credentials.

273
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:38,398
l was designated an officer
of the Cardassian Court

274
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:41,672
four years ago, in order
to testify in criminal cases.

275
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,644
Very well.

276
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,079
lf this is true,
you may accompany Mrs. O'Brien

277
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:47,878
and serve as nestor.

278
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:51,375
May l ask, what penalty
does Mr. O'Brien face?

279
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,753
His execution is scheduled
for next week.

280
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,917
How can you schedule
an execution

281
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,052
before a trial even begins?

282
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:01,688
We believe in swift justice.

283
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,857
Mrs. O'Brien, we should
leave immediately.

284
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:10,732
Begin a complete security sweep
of the station

285
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:12,866
and Chief O'Brien's
recent activities.

286
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:16,366
l want to know if there's
anything out of the ordinary

287
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:18,505
that might begin
to explain this.

288
00:16:18,547 --> 00:16:20,071
Commander, Chief
O'Brien's attitude

289
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:22,083
towards the Cardassians
is hardly a secret.

290
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:24,711
What if he actually
has done something?

291
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:30,019
Then we need to know
that, too, don't we?

292
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,044
Miles O'Brien?

293
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,877
Eh, yes, of course you are.

294
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:04,448
l'm Conservator Kovat.

295
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:07,394
l've been told that l've
already been charged

296
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:10,057
indicted, convicted
and sentenced.

297
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:12,532
What would l need
with a lawyer?

298
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:18,837
Ah, Mr. O'Brien, if it sounds
immodest of me, l apologize.

299
00:17:18,874 --> 00:17:20,967
But the role
of public conservator

300
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,969
is key to the productive
functioning of our courts.

301
00:17:25,014 --> 00:17:30,042
l'm here to help you concede
the wisdom of the state

302
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:35,546
to prepare you to accept the
inevitable with equanimity.

303
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:36,615
Ha!

304
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:44,898
There's an old
Cardassian expression:

305
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:47,698
''Confession is good
for the soul.''

306
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:50,671
But it's also good
for the populace to see

307
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:52,230
people like you confess.

308
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:54,401
lt makes them feel better
about themselves.

309
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:57,708
lt makes them-- makes their
lives-- more bearable.

310
00:17:57,746 --> 00:18:00,476
So, that's what this
is all about?

311
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:03,974
Make the people
of Cardassia feel better, huh?

312
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,748
No, no, no, no.

313
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:08,951
But that's...
that's not a bad side effect.

314
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:15,662
Now then, we have
your biographical extracts.

315
00:18:15,698 --> 00:18:18,428
We have
your Starfleet records.

316
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:20,958
All this will be very useful.

317
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:23,494
What am l being charged with?

318
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:28,203
Oh, no need to worry about that
at this point.

319
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:30,074
This is insane!

320
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:31,942
Now, whatever you've done

321
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:34,347
whatever the charges
against you

322
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:37,477
none of that really matters
in the long run.

323
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,918
What does matter?

324
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:41,684
This trial is to demonstrate

325
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:46,058
the futility of behavior
contrary to good order.

326
00:18:46,095 --> 00:18:49,496
Everyone will find it
most uplifting.

327
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:50,998
Not everyone.

328
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:52,898
Once again,
justice will be done.

329
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:56,803
Our lives will be reaffirmed,
safe and secure.

330
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,831
Here on Cardassia,
all crimes are solved

331
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,811
all criminals are punished,
all endings are happy.

332
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:08,180
Even the poorest of our subjects
can walk the streets

333
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:11,186
in the dead of night
in perfect safety.

334
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,748
You're only one man,
but your conviction

335
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:20,728
will be a salutary experience
for millions.

336
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:24,061
Now then...

337
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,158
the trial opens tomorrow.

338
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:30,729
Do you have any questions
anything you want to tell me?

339
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:33,435
Only that l am not guilty
of any crime

340
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:36,069
and that l hold
this entire procedure

341
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:38,079
with nothing but contempt.

342
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:40,012
That's good, that's good.

343
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:43,883
Maintain that level
of arrogance in the courtroom

344
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,786
and we shall put on
a very good show, indeed.

345
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:49,290
Oh, l do have one question.

346
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:50,882
Yes, certainly.

347
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:54,555
Have you ever won a case?

348
00:19:54,596 --> 00:19:57,827
Winning isn't everything.

349
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:19,968
Are they all like this?

350
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:20,975
All of them.

351
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:23,773
There isn't a photon warhead
left in here.

352
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:25,074
How could somebody transport

353
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:26,671
two dozen warheads
off this station

354
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:29,445
without the perimeter
sensors picking it up?

355
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:31,315
The metal in these crates

356
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:33,617
has the same mass
as the warheads.

357
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:35,748
A transporter
could have been programmed

358
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,281
to switch the two
simultaneously.

359
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:39,453
The sensors could
have been fooled.

360
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:42,258
But it would require
a transporter expert.

361
00:20:42,297 --> 00:20:44,697
l know what you're implying,
Major, and l don't like it.

362
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,997
Neither do l,
but there is more.

363
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:50,334
According to the logs,
O'Brien was in here

364
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:52,670
just minutes before
his runabout left.

365
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,836
Computer, play
Security Log entry

366
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:59,244
Stardate 47944.2--
weapons locker.

367
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:04,514
Request access Weapons Locker 4,
Miles O'Brien

368
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:06,180
Security Level One.

369
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,746
The computer confirmed
his voiceprint lD

370
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,257
and let him in.

371
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:12,226
As soon as the door opened

372
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,558
some kind of
field saturation device

373
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:17,690
was activated that froze all the
security scanners in the room.

374
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:20,531
l want a full analysis
of that voiceprint.

375
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:22,969
Make absolutely sure
it was O'Brien.

376
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:25,200
But it doesn't make sense.

377
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,071
What would he do
with photon warheads?

378
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:28,542
Give them to the Maquis.

379
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:30,374
We had an advisory two weeks ago

380
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:33,381
that a Maquis ship
disabled a Bolian freighter

381
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:35,849
near the Demilitarized
Zone and stole

382
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:37,784
a supply of photon launchers.

383
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:39,343
Launchers but no warheads?

384
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:41,879
Launchers, but no warheads.

385
00:21:41,923 --> 00:21:44,289
You're suggesting
that Miles O'Brien

386
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:46,726
took his wife
on a romantic vacation

387
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:50,391
as an excuse to deliver
warheads to the Maquis?

388
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:51,729
l don't believe it!

389
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:54,201
lf these warheads were
in the runabout, they'll be used

390
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:55,203
as evidence in the trial.

391
00:21:55,237 --> 00:21:56,226
Commander!

392
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:57,499
We'll find that out soon enough.

393
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:58,938
lf they were in the runabout

394
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:00,703
how did the Cardassians
find out?

395
00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:03,472
That's the one question
l want an answer to.

396
00:22:03,512 --> 00:22:06,379
l also want to find out
who the other guy was.

397
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:07,814
The other guy?

398
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:10,545
The one who was waiting
to receive these warheads.

399
00:22:10,585 --> 00:22:12,815
l'll have Starfleet lntelligence

400
00:22:12,854 --> 00:22:14,913
begin to pick up Maquis suspects
for questioning.

401
00:22:14,956 --> 00:22:17,049
ln the meantime,
let's see if we can lD

402
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:18,491
any possible Maquis members

403
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:20,495
who have been
on the station recently.

404
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:22,292
Dismissed.

405
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:36,467
Tell me you're here
to take me home.

406
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:38,445
l'm sorry.

407
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:44,080
How have they treated you?

408
00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:47,653
Not so bad.

409
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:49,782
They did some dental
work when l got here

410
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:51,520
that wasn't much fun.

411
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,289
All Cardassians are required

412
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:55,091
to give the Bureau
of ldentification

413
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:56,653
one of their first molars.

414
00:22:56,698 --> 00:22:59,428
lt's usually extracted
at age ten.

415
00:23:01,136 --> 00:23:03,570
Keiko... is she all right?

416
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:05,800
She came with me.

417
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:07,570
She's here? Now?

418
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:10,772
lt's not permitted
for family members

419
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:13,872
to visit offenders
in confinement.

420
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:17,407
She'll be at the trial tomorrow.

421
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:20,819
The Cardassians
always invite families

422
00:23:20,856 --> 00:23:23,051
to trials and executions

423
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:26,060
so that the public
can see them weep.

424
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:27,755
No.

425
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:29,593
l don't want her there.

426
00:23:29,631 --> 00:23:32,156
l don't want her
to see me like this.

427
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,760
l think that's a mistake.

428
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:37,033
My lawyer has already told me.

429
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:39,438
lt's all over but the execution.

430
00:23:39,474 --> 00:23:42,443
l... l don't even know
what l'm charged with!

431
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:44,502
Did they tell you anything?

432
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:47,811
No... but we have an idea.

433
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:49,942
What?

434
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:53,512
Have you ever had
any dealings with the Maquis?

435
00:23:53,555 --> 00:23:54,852
Dealings?

436
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,881
No. l'm not sure
what you mean.

437
00:23:56,925 --> 00:23:59,086
Do you know anybody
in the Maquis?

438
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:00,661
No.

439
00:24:00,695 --> 00:24:03,220
Ever supplied
any of them with weapons?

440
00:24:03,265 --> 00:24:04,732
No!

441
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:07,530
Are you here
to interrogate me, Constable?

442
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:11,027
ls anyone ever going to tell me
what l'm supposed to have done?

443
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:14,007
Commander Sisko informed me
a few hours ago

444
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:17,409
that 24 photon warheads
are missing from the station.

445
00:24:17,445 --> 00:24:21,176
We believe they may have been
in your runabout's cargo bay

446
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:23,047
intended for the Maquis.

447
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:26,884
The Cardassians did find
something in the hold.

448
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:27,889
That's true.

449
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:29,447
But you know nothing about it?

450
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:30,958
Nothing.

451
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:33,483
And you didn't transport them
from Weapons Locker 4

452
00:24:33,528 --> 00:24:35,018
just before you left
the station?

453
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:36,860
No.

454
00:24:36,898 --> 00:24:39,423
Were you in Weapons Locker 4
before you left the station?

455
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:40,627
No.

456
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:42,500
Then why does the log
say that you were?

457
00:24:42,537 --> 00:24:46,064
Why was it your voice
releasing the security lock?

458
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:47,768
My voice?

459
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:49,470
Your voice.

460
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,971
l don't know.

461
00:24:56,751 --> 00:25:00,915
You don't know me very well,
Constable, but l... l...

462
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:07,024
l've been in service
to the Federation-- Starfleet--

463
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:08,722
all my adult life.

464
00:25:08,763 --> 00:25:11,994
No one has ever questioned
my loyalty.

465
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:16,231
No one in my entire life
has ever had cause to ask

466
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:19,707
''Miles O'Brien,
are you a criminal?''

467
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:23,434
l took an oath...

468
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:27,574
to defend the Federation
and what it stands for.

469
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:29,675
l don't steal from them.

470
00:25:29,718 --> 00:25:31,345
l don't lie to them.

471
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:34,878
l'm no angel,
but l try to live every day

472
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:38,256
as the best human being
l know how to be.

473
00:25:38,293 --> 00:25:41,694
l need my little girl
to wake up in the morning

474
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,131
and look up at me
and see a man she can respect.

475
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:48,962
Until now, she always could.

476
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:57,642
Being accused of a crime
is not a disgrace, Chief.

477
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:01,944
Some of the great figures
of history

478
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:04,042
have shared the honor with you.

479
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:09,413
l didn't figure
on dying a martyr.

480
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:15,563
Not all of them were martyrs.

481
00:26:15,597 --> 00:26:17,531
Not all of them died.

482
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:20,557
Some of them were
just innocent men

483
00:26:20,602 --> 00:26:22,263
like you.

484
00:26:26,274 --> 00:26:30,404
Now, l've managed to get myself
named to your defense team.

485
00:26:30,445 --> 00:26:32,037
l'll be there tomorrow.

486
00:26:32,113 --> 00:26:33,774
Your wife will be there,
as well

487
00:26:33,815 --> 00:26:36,909
but she won't be weeping,
and neither will you.

488
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:38,783
l want the Archon to see

489
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,812
the clear, unwavering eyes
of an innocent man.

490
00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:43,756
ls that understood?

491
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,623
Yes, sir.

492
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,491
Guard!

493
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:52,065
l'll see you tomorrow.

494
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,691
Odo...

495
00:26:53,735 --> 00:26:56,226
thanks for being here.

496
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,321
The voice modulation patterns
don't match up.

497
00:27:11,321 --> 00:27:12,845
The voice modulation patterns
don't match up.

498
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:15,187
See how the peaks here
and here are out of phase?

499
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:16,988
So, we can prove
it wasn't O'Brien

500
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,720
who entered the weapons locker.

501
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,821
lt's O'Brien's voice,
but the sentence

502
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:22,627
was reconstructed
sound by sound.

503
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:24,959
l've got our Maquis.

504
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:26,798
l narrowed the suspects down

505
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:29,464
to 12 people who live
in the Demilitarized Zone

506
00:27:29,506 --> 00:27:31,303
and were on the station
that day.

507
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:33,104
Raymond Boone, human.
Lives on Volon lll.

508
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:34,167
Three merchants
on the Promenade

509
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,178
saw him talking to O'Brien
just before he left.

510
00:27:36,212 --> 00:27:38,544
Talking to him and recording
his voice perhaps?

511
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:39,548
Recording?

512
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:42,210
Someone doctored
Chief O'Brien's voice

513
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:43,685
to get
into the weapons locker.

514
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,087
l'll have him picked up.

515
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:51,153
The offender,
Miles O'Brien, human

516
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:54,027
officer of
the Federation Starfleet

517
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:55,655
has been found guilty

518
00:27:55,698 --> 00:27:58,030
of aiding and abetting
seditious acts

519
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:00,729
against the state.

520
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,237
The sentence is death.

521
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:03,603
Let the trial begin.

522
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,974
Conservator Kovat,
is the offender

523
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:09,978
ready to face his judgment?

524
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:11,604
He is, Madam Archon.

525
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,910
Let him enter.

526
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:32,091
Mr. O'Brien

527
00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:35,263
you can spare your family
and the Federation

528
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:38,797
further humiliation by
dispensing with this proceeding

529
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,503
and confessing now.

530
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:42,477
No, thanks.

531
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,810
Very well.

532
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,510
The Nestor
and Mrs. O'Brien may enter.

533
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:53,718
Mrs. O'Brien

534
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:56,190
this court recognizes
the disgrace

535
00:28:56,226 --> 00:28:58,558
your husband has brought to you.

536
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:01,655
As is prescribed in
the Cardassian Articles

537
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,360
of Jurisprudence,
we hereby offer you

538
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,961
the opportunity to disassociate
yourself from his actions

539
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,800
by testifying against him.

540
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,466
l have no intention

541
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:14,636
of testifying
against my husband.

542
00:29:16,346 --> 00:29:18,610
Call the first witness.

543
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:21,947
Madam Archon,
may l confer privately

544
00:29:21,985 --> 00:29:24,078
with the Conservator
before we begin?

545
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,982
l believe
that this is the first time

546
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,618
you are serving as nestor,
so perhaps l should explain

547
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:34,892
that you have no authority
to address this court.

548
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:37,593
You assist the defendant,
that is all.

549
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:39,829
l beg the court's indulgence.
l am new at this.

550
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:43,270
All of Cardassia is watching
these proceedings.

551
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:45,672
Private conferences
do not make for good viewing.

552
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:49,007
You should have done this
before we convened.

553
00:29:49,045 --> 00:29:51,912
Very well.
Make it quick.

554
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,875
Please don't ruin this for me.

555
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,319
l'm only a year away
from retirement.

556
00:29:58,354 --> 00:30:01,812
We have new evidence
to prove O'Brien's innocence.

557
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:03,155
New evidence?

558
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:04,853
lf O'Brien is accused
of stealing warheads

559
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:07,021
from Deep Space 9, we can
prove that he didn't do it.

560
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:08,257
Of course he did it.

561
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:09,890
He's been found guilty,
hasn't he?

562
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,491
Someone manipulated
a recording

563
00:30:11,534 --> 00:30:12,899
of his voice to gain entry.

564
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,166
l can produce
that recording here.

565
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:17,172
No evidence can be submitted

566
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:19,003
after the verdict
has been reached.

567
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,168
You should know that.

568
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,837
Of course, but l was
hoping that the most

569
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:25,677
renowned conservator
in all of Cardassia...

570
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:27,842
You flatter me, sir,
you flatter me.

571
00:30:27,884 --> 00:30:29,681
But we want justice

572
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:32,017
not chaos in this court.

573
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,683
No, l will have
no part of this.

574
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:36,248
Enough!

575
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,624
Are you ready to proceed,
Conservator?

576
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:39,753
l am.

577
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,388
Madam Archon,
may l address the court?

578
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:43,729
Didn't l just explain to you
that you may not?

579
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:45,063
But if our Conservator

580
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:47,069
refuses to bring up
new evidence...

581
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:47,829
Silence!

582
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,837
...of a manipulated

583
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:50,065
recording
of the offender's voice

584
00:30:50,106 --> 00:30:51,334
that would prove
his innocence...

585
00:30:51,374 --> 00:30:53,069
You are out of order, sir!

586
00:30:53,176 --> 00:30:54,803
What else am l
supposed to do?

587
00:30:54,844 --> 00:30:58,473
You are supposed to respect
our judicial procedures.

588
00:30:58,514 --> 00:31:01,506
Wouldn't you ask
that we respect your rules

589
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:02,882
if we were in your court?

590
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:04,853
Which raises my next point,
Madam Archon.

591
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:07,549
l would like to move for
a change of venue to my court.

592
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,753
No crime has been committed
against Cardassia.

593
00:31:10,793 --> 00:31:13,660
lt was, in fact, committed
at a Bajoran space station.

594
00:31:13,696 --> 00:31:16,130
Madam Archon,
l am extremely humiliated.

595
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,599
l ask to be relieved
of this assignment.

596
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:19,602
No!

597
00:31:19,636 --> 00:31:20,864
Sit down!

598
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:27,133
And you, sir...

599
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,577
do not try the patience
of the Cardassian people.

600
00:31:30,613 --> 00:31:33,173
lf this court finds you
in contempt

601
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:36,617
you will find the punishment
very unpleasant.

602
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:39,588
l regret that l have no teeth

603
00:31:39,622 --> 00:31:42,887
to offer your Bureau
of ldentification.

604
00:31:45,094 --> 00:31:48,996
As for new evidence, yes,
l fully expected the Federation

605
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,626
to come up with
remarkable new evidence

606
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:53,966
in an attempt
to free Mr. O'Brien.

607
00:31:54,003 --> 00:31:55,595
l am sure your experts

608
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:58,038
can create
all sorts of evidence

609
00:31:58,074 --> 00:32:00,065
to confuse the issues.

610
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:04,010
That may work in your courts,
but not here.

611
00:32:04,113 --> 00:32:07,480
There will be no new
evidence considered.

612
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:12,177
Call the first witness!

613
00:32:15,858 --> 00:32:18,019
Look, we're not
after the Maquis.

614
00:32:18,094 --> 00:32:19,994
We're just trying
to help an innocent man.

615
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:21,758
And l'm telling you.
l don't have

616
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:23,663
any idea
what you're talking about.

617
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,895
People saw you
talking to O'Brien

618
00:32:25,935 --> 00:32:27,334
just before he left.

619
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,201
Well, since when is
that a crime?

620
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,672
We're old friends
from the <i>Rutledge.</i>

621
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,675
Doesn't it bother you

622
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,540
that an old friend is
about to be executed

623
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,839
by the Cardassians?

624
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:37,345
Of course, it does.

625
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,371
l wish there was something
l could do to help.

626
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:42,509
He has a wife
and a five-year-old daughter.

627
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:45,146
lf you're worried
we'll turn you over

628
00:32:45,188 --> 00:32:48,885
to the Cardassians,
l can assure you that we won't.

629
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,950
Well, l haven't done anything.

630
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:53,689
l don't have anything
to be worried about.

631
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:58,656
Hold him
for further questioning.

632
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:12,670
Computer, lights.

633
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,555
Don't turn around, Doctor.

634
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,829
There's nothing here
you could want.

635
00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:33,529
You have a man in custody

636
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:36,037
suspected
of arranging the theft

637
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:38,869
of photon warheads--
Raymond Boone.

638
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,341
That's right.

639
00:33:40,376 --> 00:33:43,004
l'm here to tell you
he is not one of us.

640
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:44,512
''Not one of us''?

641
00:33:44,547 --> 00:33:47,038
You're from the Maquis.

642
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:49,176
That's correct.

643
00:33:49,218 --> 00:33:50,776
Why should l believe you?

644
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,482
We knew nothing
about the theft

645
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:56,048
and this man is not one of us.

646
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,457
And that's all l can tell you.

647
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:02,453
How do l know you're not
just trying to protect him?

648
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,466
Who else would want photon...

649
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,331
warheads?

650
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,282
The Maquis are savage,
Federation-born killers!

651
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:16,651
They live to terrorize
and murder innocent Cardassians

652
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:20,419
as evidenced by these weapons we
confiscated from O'Brien's ship.

653
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:24,987
These Maquis are based
in the Demilitarized Zone?

654
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,691
They are all
from Federation settlements

655
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,223
inside Cardassian
occupied territory.

656
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,726
Frankly, the situation
is becoming untenable.

657
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:36,741
How many more innocent
people must die

658
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,505
before the situation
becomes clear?

659
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:42,012
How do you know
these photon warheads

660
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:44,447
recovered from
the offender's vessel

661
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:47,680
were intended for the Maquis?

662
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,553
According to reliable sources,
the Maquis arranged the theft.

663
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,023
l object!

664
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,787
Madam Archon, please!

665
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,887
l thought we went over this
yesterday, Mr. Odo.

666
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,955
What is it this time?

667
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,797
Gul Evek has tied the Maquis
to this plot

668
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,962
by quoting reliable sources.

669
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:10,940
l think we deserve to know
who these reliable sources are.

670
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,637
Can you provide
any details, Gul Evek?

671
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,838
l am afraid that information
cannot be revealed

672
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,144
without risk to national
security, Madam Archon.

673
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:18,740
That's an acceptable answer.

674
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,683
Might we know how Gul Evek

675
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,381
learned the warheads
were in the runabout?

676
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,945
Yes, of course.

677
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,618
We learned about them
from reliable sources.

678
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,321
Are you satisfied, Nestor?

679
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,091
Madam Archon...

680
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,997
Enough! This is already
the longest trial

681
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,398
in the history of Cardassia.

682
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,404
Let's try to speed things up,
shall we?

683
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,167
Proceed, Mr. Kovat.

684
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:47,178
As you wish, Madam Archon.

685
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:50,739
l'll try to be
as brief as possible.

686
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,187
What is this?

687
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,620
l'd like Dr. Bashir
to give you

688
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,680
a physical examination.

689
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,917
What for?

690
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,256
To help us answer
some questions about you.

691
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:03,659
What are you talking about?

692
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,959
For example,
why you haven't spoken

693
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,965
to your parents
in eight years.

694
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,058
What's that got to do
with anything?

695
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,591
l never got along with them.

696
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,627
That's not what they told us.

697
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,300
You left your wife
about eight years ago.

698
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,366
You'd been married
a long time--

699
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,707
almost 15 years, wasn't it?

700
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,144
Look, this is none
of your business.

701
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,647
And about the same time

702
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,980
you were discharged
from Starfleet

703
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,245
after failing several crew
performance reviews.

704
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,313
All of this seemed to happen
shortly after Setlik lll.

705
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,684
Bring him over here.

706
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,199
Some romantic vacation
l took you on, huh?

707
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:45,294
We'll have other chances.

708
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:48,238
Keiko, l don't want you
to be there next week.

709
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,740
lt isn't over yet.

710
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,867
Don't give them
the satisfaction.

711
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,104
Miles, you can't just...

712
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,372
l mean it.

713
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:13,988
Court will resume.

714
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,858
The offender will
step forward and testify.

715
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,736
l have nothing
to say to this court.

716
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:24,970
Under Cardassian law,
you are compelled to testify.

717
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,533
Step forward.

718
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:36,116
This would be a good time
to advise the offender.

719
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:38,247
Advise him to do what?

720
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,814
To confess.

721
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:42,622
To throw himself on the mercy
of the court, of course.

722
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:46,529
l never heard of a Cardassian
court showing mercy.

723
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:50,261
That is not the point.

724
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:54,932
Think of the children, sir.

725
00:37:54,973 --> 00:38:00,309
Allow them to see
a glimmer of enlightenment.

726
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:03,314
As the offender realizes

727
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:05,942
that the end is near

728
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:11,479
let him use his last breath
to show remorse.

729
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,514
Do you wish
to advise the offender

730
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:15,116
at this time, Nestor?

731
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,257
No, Madam Archon.

732
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,829
Very well.
Proceed, Mr. Kovat.

733
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:33,467
Mr. O'Brien,
were you abused as a child?

734
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,478
What?

735
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:38,073
Were your parents
especially abusive?

736
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:40,914
Did you hate them very much?

737
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:43,648
l loved my parents.

738
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,020
l see.

739
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:53,454
Spousal abuse, perhaps?

740
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:58,492
Was your wife causing you
severe psychological stress?

741
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,231
My wife is the most wonderful

742
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,205
supportive person
l've ever known.

743
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,730
Excuse me for asking.

744
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,936
l'm merely trying to establish

745
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:09,606
why a fine man like you
could turn into a criminal.

746
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,377
Now, perhaps you could help me.

747
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:15,181
Sorry, no, l can't help,
because l'm no criminal.

748
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,615
Well...

749
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,317
l tried.

750
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,851
Tell me, Mr. O'Brien

751
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,489
how many Cardassians
have you killed?

752
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,964
Killed?

753
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,466
None.

754
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,560
Since the war, that is.

755
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:33,332
lncluding the war

756
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,137
how many Cardassians
have you killed?

757
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,405
Madam Archon, what relevance

758
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:42,641
does Mr. O'Brien's
war experiences have?

759
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,648
His past criminal record

760
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,810
is very much relevant
to these proceedings, sir.

761
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,979
Answer the question.

762
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,921
l'm not sure.

763
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,549
That many, eh?

764
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:55,854
lt was war.

765
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,987
Both sides did things
they had to do.

766
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,998
Tell me, Mr. O'Brien,
now that we are at peace

767
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,365
do you have a warm place
in your heart

768
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,371
for your Cardassian
neighbors

769
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:12,365
or are you deeply prejudiced
against Cardassians?

770
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,208
Do you not, in fact,
hate Cardassians?

771
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,680
Have you not
on several occasions

772
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:21,014
publicly stated
your opposition to the treaty

773
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,019
because, and l quote

774
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,614
''The bloody Cardies
can't be trusted''?

775
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,683
l decline to answer that.

776
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,078
There are no grounds

777
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:32,406
in Cardassian law
which permit you to decline.

778
00:40:32,447 --> 00:40:33,471
Answer the question.

779
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:37,952
ls it an accurate quote or not?

780
00:40:37,986 --> 00:40:40,250
lt is.

781
00:40:40,288 --> 00:40:42,722
Madam Archon, at this time

782
00:40:42,757 --> 00:40:47,421
it seems the offender's guilt
has been clearly established

783
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:52,024
and l see no other alternative
but to concede the verdict.

784
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:53,327
l do not concede!

785
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,801
You may stand down, Mr. O'Brien.

786
00:40:54,836 --> 00:40:56,895
l am not guilty!

787
00:40:56,938 --> 00:40:58,667
l've committed no crime

788
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,231
and l do not concede
to this court

789
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:03,335
or the Cardassian Empire!

790
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,970
Madam Archon, l apologize

791
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,946
but l appear to have lost
control of my client.

792
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:09,449
No matter.

793
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:13,420
You've done your usual
eloquent job on his behalf

794
00:41:13,454 --> 00:41:15,149
Conservator Kovat.

795
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,851
Thank you, Madam Archon.

796
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,189
This has been
a most difficult case

797
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,287
but it is always an honor
to serve your court.

798
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,000
l object to this.

799
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,597
Madam Archon

800
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:37,338
how can you continue
to tolerate these intrusions?

801
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:40,472
Return to your seat.

802
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:51,551
Once again, the Cardassian
System of Jurisprudence

803
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,993
has worked
to protect its people.

804
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:57,828
A guilty man
has been brought to justice.

805
00:41:57,865 --> 00:42:00,333
But never let it be said

806
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:05,465
that there is no room
in this system for compassion.

807
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:10,534
l sense in Mr. O'Brien--
a man with strong family ties--

808
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:13,843
the potential
for rehabilitation.

809
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:16,076
And l'm sure
that he has gained

810
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,585
a new appreciation
of Cardassian law

811
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,850
through this difficult process.

812
00:42:20,888 --> 00:42:22,583
Therefore, l am pleased

813
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:26,993
in the spirit of furthering
Cardassian-Federation relations

814
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:31,328
to hereby set aside the verdict
and to release Mr. O'Brien

815
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:33,698
into the custody
of his Commander

816
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:35,566
Benjamin Sisko.

817
00:42:43,745 --> 00:42:45,212
What happened?

818
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:46,213
What...

819
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:47,373
You won.

820
00:42:47,415 --> 00:42:48,848
l...

821
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:55,216
They'll kill me.

822
00:43:01,296 --> 00:43:03,491
Then the Maquis
told you about Boone.

823
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:05,624
When Doctor Bashir
examined him

824
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,966
he discovered that Boone
was missing his first molar.

825
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,166
The DNA analysis confirmed
that he was Cardassian.

826
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:14,174
He was surgically altered?

827
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,574
Eight years ago, to replace
the real Raymond Boone

828
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:18,545
who was taken prisoner
at Setlik lll

829
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:20,843
and apparently
killed in detention.

830
00:43:20,882 --> 00:43:22,509
Well, how did you figure it out?

831
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,074
His ex-wife told us

832
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:26,643
he came back from captivity
a different man.

833
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:29,122
She blamed it
on the treatment he received

834
00:43:29,157 --> 00:43:32,217
from the Cardassians,
but it started us to thinking.

835
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,524
So, he was spying
for the Cardassians

836
00:43:34,562 --> 00:43:37,190
even when he was serving
on the <i>Rutledge</i> with me?

837
00:43:37,231 --> 00:43:39,358
But why would they
want to frame Miles?

838
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,095
This trial was never

839
00:43:41,135 --> 00:43:43,330
about your husband,
Mrs. O'Brien.

840
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,770
lt was designed
from the beginning

841
00:43:44,806 --> 00:43:46,000
to discredit the Federation--

842
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:48,634
to show that the Maquis
had their official sanction.

843
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:50,837
Gul Evek's testimony
made it clear

844
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,506
that the situation
had become untenable.

845
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,243
Next, they would
have been demanding

846
00:43:55,283 --> 00:43:57,342
that the Federation
colonies be disbanded.

847
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,852
Exactly.

848
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,184
When Makbar saw Boone
in the courtroom

849
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,850
she realized that we had
the goods to embarrass

850
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,621
the High Command
in front of the entire populace.

851
00:44:06,661 --> 00:44:08,856
Oh, l'm just glad
it's all over.

852
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,955
l'm ready to get back
to work.

853
00:44:11,032 --> 00:44:12,966
Oh, no, no, no.

854
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,127
l had to use
all of my influence

855
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:18,161
to extend your accommodations
at the lagoon.

856
00:44:18,206 --> 00:44:20,834
We'll drop you off
on our way home.

857
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,343
But we haven't any bags,
no holo-cam.

858
00:44:23,378 --> 00:44:25,676
l've nothing to read.

859
00:44:25,713 --> 00:44:27,203
Perfect.
