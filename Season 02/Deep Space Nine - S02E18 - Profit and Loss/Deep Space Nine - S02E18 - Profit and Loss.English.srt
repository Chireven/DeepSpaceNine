1
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:05,163
Definitely Cardassian.

2
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:06,255
And in trouble.

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,266
lts engines are
completely disabled.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,029
Open a hailing frequency.

5
00:00:10,068 --> 00:00:13,435
This is Commander Sisko
of Deep Space 9.

6
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,167
Do you need assistance?

7
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:16,764
They're not answering.

8
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,742
Their life-support systems

9
00:00:18,777 --> 00:00:20,677
are operating
on reserve power.

10
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:24,705
Better lock on a tractor beam
and pull them into Cargo Bay 7.

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,048
Tell Mr. O'Brien
to meet me there.

12
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:42,166
Welcome aboard.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,964
l'm Benjamin Sisko,
Commander of Deep Space 9.

14
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,200
My Chief of Operations,
Miles O'Brien.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,174
Do any of you need
medical assistance?

16
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,540
l think we're all
fine, considering.

17
00:00:52,577 --> 00:00:54,204
l'm Professor Natima Lang.

18
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:57,908
These are two of my students,
Rekelen and Hogue.

19
00:00:57,949 --> 00:00:59,507
And what happened to your ship?

20
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,212
We were caught
in a meteor storm.

21
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:03,016
l'm a decent teacher,
but l'm afraid

22
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:04,682
l'm not much
of a shuttle pilot.

23
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:07,157
Do you think you'll be
able to repair our ship?

24
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,160
l'll have to take a look.

25
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,821
Excuse me.

26
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,525
We'd like to be on our way
as soon as possible.

27
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:16,158
We know having Cardassians

28
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,761
on a Bajoran station
may cause trouble.

29
00:01:18,804 --> 00:01:20,704
That's the last thing we want.

30
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:24,505
lf anyone can fix your ship,
it is Mr. O'Brien.

31
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,137
ln the meantime,
you're welcome to stay here.

32
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:29,773
lf you stick to the Promenade

33
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:31,976
l'm sure there
won't be any trouble.

34
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:33,746
Wait, wait, wait a second.

35
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:35,582
Are you telling me
that you agreed

36
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,350
with General Yiri's decision
to execute his brother?

37
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,948
Of course, l agree.

38
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:43,791
Yiri's brother was a traitor
to the Trelonian government.

39
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,353
The evidence is
all circumstantial.

40
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,331
lt all comes down
to a question of loyalty.

41
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,833
My dear Doctor

42
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:51,529
Yiri had to choose between
protecting his brother

43
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,867
and protecting the state.

44
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,201
He chose the state.

45
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,537
As would l, every time.

46
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,702
Well, l suppose that's
one way of looking at it.

47
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,405
But then again,
before you can be

48
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:02,879
loyal to another, you
must be loyal to yourself.

49
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:07,783
And who can we thank for those
misguided words of wisdom?

50
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,377
Sarek of Vulcan?

51
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,356
Actually, it was
Bashir of Earth.

52
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,120
With sentiments like those

53
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,322
you wouldn't last
for five seconds on Cardassia.

54
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:18,795
Would you?

55
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:22,732
Fishing again, Doctor?

56
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,668
Well, assuming
you're not a spy...

57
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:25,670
Assuming?

58
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:27,365
Then, maybe you're an outcast.

59
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:30,170
Or maybe l'm an outcast spy.

60
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,300
Ah, how could you be both?

61
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:35,245
l never said l was either.

62
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:45,189
l heard an interesting
rumor today.

63
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:46,622
Only one?

64
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:47,852
l started at least 12.

65
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:49,861
Rumor has it
that you've managed

66
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:52,864
to get your hands
on a small cloaking device.

67
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:54,525
And you believe
everything you hear?

68
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:56,625
When it's about you, yes.

69
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:58,693
According to Bajoran law

70
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:01,934
such a device would
be highly illegal.

71
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,806
lf l had one, which l don't.

72
00:03:04,843 --> 00:03:07,141
l didn't expect
you to admit it.

73
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:08,806
l'm simply serving notice.

74
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:11,816
You try to sell it,
and l'll see to it

75
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,148
that you spend
the next 50 years

76
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:15,983
digging trenches
in a penal colony.

77
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:17,147
l told you.

78
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:20,782
You have nothing
to worry about.

79
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,565
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

80
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:30,568
Hey!

81
00:03:30,602 --> 00:03:32,365
Out of my way!
Excuse me!

82
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:33,496
Natima!

83
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:34,664
Quark!

84
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:36,105
l knew you'd come...

85
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:39,474
l told you never
to speak to me again.

86
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,346
Are you all right?

87
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:48,147
All right?

88
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:52,020
This is the happiest
day of my life.

89
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,888
Natima, wait!

90
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,159
At least let me buy you
and your friends a drink.

91
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,190
l could make you
a Samarian Sunset.

92
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,601
l don't drink
Samarian Sunsets anymore.

93
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:11,969
Why not?

94
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:13,769
Because they remind me of you.

95
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,332
ls this Ferengi bothering you?

96
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,174
This Ferengi happens to be

97
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,476
Natima's old
and cherished friend.

98
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:21,503
Who are you?

99
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,913
These are my students.

100
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,611
Students?
You don't say?

101
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:28,918
l'd love to sit in
on one of your classes.

102
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,218
What do you teach?

103
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,224
Political ethics.

104
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,158
Her teachings will change
the future of Cardassia.

105
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,558
That's enough, Rekelen.

106
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,425
Not at all.

107
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,026
l want to hear more.

108
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,836
l always knew Natima
was destined for greatness.

109
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,068
Quark.

110
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,075
Just one drink.

111
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,077
lt'll be like old times.

112
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,841
lt'll never be
like old times.

113
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,077
You're right--
it'll be better.

114
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,846
l'll be right back
with refreshments.

115
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:07,421
Your hands are shaking.

116
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:11,693
So, how well does
this woman know you?

117
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,029
Just enough to dislike you

118
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,931
or well enough
to really hate you?

119
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,266
She used to work
here on the station.

120
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,771
She was a correspondent

121
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,297
with the Cardassian
lnformation Service.

122
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:23,242
lt was before your time.

123
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,735
So, which is it--
dislike or hate?

124
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,146
lt's none of your business.

125
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:33,620
But if you have to know,
l was the love of her life.

126
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:38,320
Hmph!
Must have been some life.

127
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,451
What about our drinks?

128
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:42,792
You want a drink?

129
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,798
The bar's right over there.

130
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,163
Go ahead.

131
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,169
Your Samarian Sunset.

132
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,375
l said l didn't
drink these anymore.

133
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,440
Because they remind you of me.

134
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:07,420
But since l'm here anyway,
you may as well enjoy yourself.

135
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,354
Besides, it's on the house.

136
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,860
You know, you're
as beautiful as ever.

137
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:25,201
And you're as big
a liar as ever.

138
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,799
You see, just like old times.

139
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,538
l've missed you, Natima,
and that's no lie.

140
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,745
You seem to have kept busy.

141
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:37,751
Oh, yes

142
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,047
l'm very successful.

143
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,384
But as the 223rd Rule
of Acquisition says...

144
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:44,653
Please! l haven't heard
a Rule of Acquisition

145
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,715
in seven years

146
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,057
and l don't want
to hear one now.

147
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,858
So... how long you going
to be on the station?

148
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:55,130
Thank you for another
enjoyable lunch, Doctor.

149
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,745
l didn't think
there were any Cardassians

150
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,011
left on this station.

151
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,016
He's the only one.

152
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,017
What do we do now?

153
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,417
ls something wrong?

154
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:16,320
We have to leave
as soon as possible.

155
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,256
Goodbye, Quark.
Thanks for the drink.

156
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,054
But... you didn't touch it.

157
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,494
How are your repairs coming?

158
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,797
The damage is more extensive
than l thought.

159
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:30,770
They were lucky
to escape the attack.

160
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:31,930
The attack?

161
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,769
They weren't
in any meteor storm.

162
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,605
They were hit
by Cardassian disrupters.

163
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,270
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

164
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:41,748
Why would Cardassians
fire on other Cardassians?

165
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,909
Maybe you should ask her.

166
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,054
Commander, l hate
to be an imposition

167
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:50,623
but l need my ship.

168
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,783
That's not possible.

169
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,986
Mr. O'Brien is
still working on it.

170
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,621
Your ship sustained more damage
than we originally thought.

171
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,960
ln fact...

172
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,397
You suspect that our ship

173
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,060
was damaged
by Cardassian weapons.

174
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,329
You're right, of course.

175
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,336
Professor.

176
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,462
lt's all right, Hogue.

177
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,803
l should have told them
the truth in the first place.

178
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,240
Then why didn't you?

179
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,268
Because Cardassians
don't involve outsiders

180
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,543
in their internal politics,
especially Bajorans.

181
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:19,678
Being shot at by your own people
goes a little beyond politics.

182
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,348
We take our politics
very seriously.

183
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,790
Commander, if l don't
get my students to safety

184
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,851
they're going to be killed.

185
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,089
And if they die

186
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,292
the future of Cardassia
may die with them.

187
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,376
There are some who believe
that the future of Cardassia

188
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:47,505
should not remain
in the hands of the military.

189
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:49,243
And you're among them?

190
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:50,250
Yes, we are.

191
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:51,376
Rekelen and Hogue are two

192
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,477
of the most important leaders
of our movement.

193
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,919
Which makes you fugitives.

194
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,621
The military is afraid
to let us speak our minds.

195
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,630
They've already tried
to kill us once.

196
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,529
They're sure to try again.

197
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:09,002
Which is why l have to get
them off this station

198
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,503
as soon as possible.

199
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:13,472
l'll dispatch additional work
crews to help repair your ship.

200
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,941
We saw another Cardassian
aboard the station, in the bar.

201
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,637
Garak.
He saw you?

202
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:18,906
l'm certain of it.

203
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:22,211
Well, then,
we may have a problem.

204
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,980
Mr. Garak is a bit
of a mystery to us.

205
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,011
l'll assign you
some guest quarters.

206
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,183
You'll be safe there
until your ship is ready.

207
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:34,625
We appreciate
your assistance, Commander.

208
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,660
Ah, Mr. Quark.

209
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,536
This is a surprise.

210
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,062
l don't believe
you've ever been

211
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,438
in my establishment before.

212
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,000
You usually don't
frequent mine either.

213
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,376
Though l did see
you in there today.

214
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,507
Ah, the replimat
was a little crowded.

215
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,916
So, what brings you here now?

216
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:02,615
Oh, l just wanted to see
what you were offering.

217
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,854
Ooh, what do you get for that?

218
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,019
Ah ha...

219
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,827
17 strips of latinum.

220
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,355
Whoo, l'll tell you what--

221
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,424
l'll give you 20.

222
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:15,748
Twenty!

223
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:19,783
How uncharacteristically
generous for a Ferengi.

224
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:22,379
Just one businessman
trying to help out another.

225
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,548
l figure we have
to stick together.

226
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,718
Well, this is the latest
style on my home world.

227
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,886
Do you like it?

228
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:31,328
l'm no expert
in Cardassian fashions.

229
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:32,421
What do you think?

230
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:33,863
Well, l don't know.

231
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,335
lt's been so long since
l've had a Cardassian customer.

232
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:38,768
Then you're in luck.

233
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:42,001
There's some on board
the station right now.

234
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,339
Now, that you mention it

235
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:50,337
l think your lady friend might
find this style very appealing.

236
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:53,442
You're old friends, aren't you?

237
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:56,977
You're very perceptive...
for a Cardassian.

238
00:12:57,022 --> 00:12:59,991
lt would have been hard to miss
the way you were looking at her.

239
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:02,516
lt would have been hard to miss
the way you were looking at her.

240
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:06,361
Personally, l find this style
a bit too radical.

241
00:13:06,398 --> 00:13:08,798
But your friend seems the sort

242
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,394
who appreciates
that kind of thing.

243
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:13,428
Different tastes
for different people.

244
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:15,303
Nothing wrong with that.
ls there?

245
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:17,241
Oh, you'd be surprised

246
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:21,007
how detrimental
a poor choice of fashion can be.

247
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,308
Take this dress.

248
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:24,373
lt may be all the rage now

249
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,681
but in a very short time
it can become tiresome--

250
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,018
an affront to the eyes.

251
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:33,319
Certain people might even
think it's objectionable.

252
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,690
And then...

253
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:40,159
nothing but rags.

254
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:41,666
l see.

255
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,229
Mr. Quark, might l offer
you some free advice?

256
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:49,969
As long as l'm under no
obligation to follow it.

257
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,705
l've been in this
business a long time

258
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:55,009
and l know
there's nothing worse

259
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,277
than following
the wrong trend.

260
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:59,546
Now, you're a smart fellow

261
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:03,077
with your own inimitable
sense of style.

262
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:08,185
Perhaps you should mention this
to your lady friend.

263
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:12,391
l'd hate to see her
fall victim to fashion.

264
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:14,524
Would you like to explain that?

265
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:16,227
She's chosen
to associate herself

266
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:18,293
with some rather
flamboyant companions.

267
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:22,103
lt would be a tragedy
if she got in the way

268
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:25,406
when her friends
go out of fashion.

269
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:27,002
lf anyone tries to harm her

270
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,377
they're going
to have to deal with me.

271
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:32,009
And what are you going to do?

272
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:35,450
Shortchange them
at the dabo table?

273
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,424
l think l'll buy
this dress after all.

274
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:44,759
Ah.

275
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,355
See that it's mended.

276
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:52,034
What is it you want from me?

277
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:53,536
l know you're in trouble.

278
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:54,664
l want to help you.

279
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,174
l don't want your help.

280
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,505
l owe you.
You saved my life.

281
00:14:57,543 --> 00:15:00,171
lf you'd turned me over
to the authorities

282
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:01,941
l would have been executed.

283
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:03,471
l admired your courage.

284
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:05,745
lt was a brave thing
you were doing

285
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:07,684
selling food to the Bajorans.

286
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,881
l thought you
were a man of honor.

287
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:10,889
l'm a Ferengi.

288
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:13,221
You should have known better.

289
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:15,249
You're right-- l should have.

290
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:17,728
lnstead...

291
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:20,664
Can't you even say it?

292
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,224
l can't even think it.

293
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:26,169
Okay, l'll say it for you.

294
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:27,729
We fell in love

295
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:32,403
and that month we spent together
was the best time of our lives

296
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:33,741
and you know it.

297
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,940
l think you're confusing
lust with love.

298
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:38,643
l admit, l'm capable of that,
but not this time.

299
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:39,912
l loved you, Natima.

300
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:42,443
Then how could you
have betrayed me?

301
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,115
l didn't betray you.

302
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:45,589
Don't lie to me, Quark.

303
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:46,989
l know better.

304
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:48,857
You used
my personal access codes

305
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:51,829
to authorize payments
for goods you never provided.

306
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:53,229
So, l took a little money

307
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:55,631
from the Cardassian
Communication Service.

308
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:56,827
They could afford it.

309
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:58,336
You stole that money.

310
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,032
l saw a chance for profit,
and l took it.

311
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:02,563
Maybe that was wrong.

312
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:03,905
l don't know.

313
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:07,207
But what l really regret
is betraying your trust.

314
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:09,976
That was the worst mistake
of my life.

315
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,540
And you'd do it
again in a second.

316
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:14,518
l believed in you, Quark

317
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:17,954
but you were using me,
like you use everyone--

318
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,617
for profit.

319
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:22,889
Then let me make it up to you.
Let me help you.

320
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:23,986
l ask for nothing in return.

321
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:25,155
Nothing?

322
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:28,325
Except that you stay
with me forever.

323
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,801
l can't stay here.

324
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:32,861
My students need me.

325
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:34,532
Listen to me, Natima.

326
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:36,564
You can't leave me, not now.

327
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:40,135
lf you don't stay with me,
l'll have to follow you.

328
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:44,616
And l will-- wherever you go--
until you agree to take me back.

329
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,118
You don't even know
who l am anymore.

330
00:16:47,152 --> 00:16:49,746
l'm part of the Cardassian
Underground.

331
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:52,348
Following me will
only get you killed.

332
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:54,325
l'll take that chance.

333
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,485
What about the bar?

334
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:57,017
l don't care about the bar.

335
00:16:57,062 --> 00:16:58,256
l'll turn it over to Rom.

336
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:01,027
He'll run it into the ground in
a month, but it doesn't matter.

337
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:02,090
l have to be with you.

338
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:04,125
lt won't work, Quark.

339
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:07,229
You say you'd do
anything for me.

340
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:10,639
Maybe right now,
you even believe it.

341
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:12,405
But l know better.

342
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:16,437
ln the end,
you'd only care about yourself.

343
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:22,181
But l love you.

344
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:24,348
l don't love you.

345
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:28,554
Uh-huh, now which one
of us is lying?

346
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:30,892
You better go.

347
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:33,889
All right...

348
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:36,560
but if there's
anything you need--

349
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:39,332
anything at all--
l'll be waiting.

350
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:41,862
lt'll be a long wait.

351
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:58,018
Professor Lang's ship
should be ready to go

352
00:17:58,123 --> 00:17:59,681
in about an hour, Commander.

353
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:01,386
Good. l'll let her know.

354
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:04,884
We have a Cardassian warship
approaching, fast.

355
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,090
On screen.

356
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:07,792
Hail them, Lieutenant.

357
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,095
No response.

358
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:10,761
They're taking up
an attack posture.

359
00:18:10,802 --> 00:18:11,962
They're ignoring us.

360
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,436
They're powering up
their forward disrupters.

361
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:15,440
Shields.

362
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:16,600
Shields up.

363
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:18,610
Lock on phasers
and photon torpedoes.

364
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:20,612
Prepare to fire, if necessary.

365
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:21,738
Commander...

366
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:30,486
l think we should talk.

367
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:43,197
All right, Garak,
do you mind telling me

368
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:45,829
why a Cardassian warship
is threatening my station?

369
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:47,361
No one is threatening you.

370
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:49,966
The Central Command
merely wants to make sure

371
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:51,942
they have your
undivided attention.

372
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:53,001
Well, they have it.

373
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:54,478
l assume this has
something to do

374
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:56,140
with Professor Lang
and her students?

375
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:59,014
''Students'' is a rather
benign term for them.

376
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:01,322
''Terrorists'' would
be more accurate.

377
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:03,923
The Cardassian government
would very much like

378
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,426
Hogue and Rekelen
returned home immediately.

379
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,758
They haven't committed
any crimes here.

380
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:11,094
As long as they're
on my station

381
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:13,259
they're free to do
whatever they want.

382
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,927
This is all very embarrassing,
Commander.

383
00:19:15,035 --> 00:19:17,503
The Central Command
would hate to see

384
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:19,267
the Federation pulled

385
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:22,104
into such an insignificant
and purely internal affair.

386
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:23,804
l'd hardly call
it insignificant.

387
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:26,142
Judging by the behavior
of the ship out there

388
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,738
it appears the Central Command

389
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:30,580
considers Hogue and Rekelen
to be extremely dangerous.

390
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:32,085
Not at all.

391
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,450
Annoying perhaps

392
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:35,955
inconvenient maybe,
but dangerous?

393
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:36,954
Hardly.

394
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:38,718
And if they were dangerous

395
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,456
would the Central Command
entrust the situation to me

396
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:43,861
a simple tailor?

397
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:47,493
Which only confirms what
l have suspected all along.

398
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:49,935
You, Mr. Garak,
are no simple tailor.

399
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:52,529
Oh, really, Commander.

400
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:55,508
That's another
discussion entirely.

401
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:57,807
All you really need
to know right now

402
00:19:57,845 --> 00:20:01,838
is that the return of Hogue and
Rekelen is in the best interest

403
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:03,474
of the Cardassian Empire.

404
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:07,078
Or at least in the best interest
of the Cardassian military.

405
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:08,418
ls there a difference?

406
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:09,616
Do you really expect

407
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:12,217
a Bajoran station
under Federation command

408
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,591
to turn over Cardassian
political refugees

409
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:15,822
on your say-so?

410
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:19,094
The ultimate decision
is, of course, yours.

411
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:21,624
l am simply relaying a message.

412
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:25,129
Then relay this.

413
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:27,538
Tell the Central Command

414
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:32,740
if anyone attempts to take
Hogue and Rekelen by force

415
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,010
l will respond in kind.

416
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:37,516
Am l clear, Mr. Garak?

417
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:38,950
Absolutely.

418
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:42,149
Thank you for your time.

419
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:46,751
Oh, and if you'd like,
stop by the shop one day.

420
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:49,160
l have a number of suits

421
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:53,098
that would look
quite flattering on you.

422
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:01,730
Here you go.

423
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:03,299
Two mugs of <i>kanar,</i>
on the house.

424
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:04,971
We didn't order these.

425
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:06,536
They're the drinks
l promised you

426
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,070
the first time
you came in here.

427
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:09,173
Sorry they took so long

428
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:10,979
but things have been
a little hectic.

429
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:11,985
Do you mind?

430
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:13,384
l'm afraid that we do.

431
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,547
Professor Lang told us
you couldn't be trusted.

432
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:19,650
Ooh, you Cardassians
do hold grudges.

433
00:21:19,693 --> 00:21:21,320
Seven years ago

434
00:21:21,362 --> 00:21:25,628
Natima and l had some
little, silly lover's quarrel

435
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,157
And... well, all l can say is

436
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:31,000
l'm willing to let
bygones be bygones.

437
00:21:31,105 --> 00:21:32,595
But Professor Lang isn't.

438
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,608
l have to say,
l find your loyalty to her

439
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:35,836
extremely... touching.

440
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:37,844
There is nothing that
we wouldn't do for her

441
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:39,903
and if she says that
we're not to talk to you

442
00:21:39,947 --> 00:21:40,914
we don't talk to you.

443
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:42,745
l understand.
She's your teacher.

444
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:44,250
You're her students.

445
00:21:44,285 --> 00:21:46,185
You have to listen to her.

446
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,245
So, if you don't
want to talk

447
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:49,620
to the only person

448
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:52,990
who can get you off
this station in one piece

449
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:54,517
that's fine with me.

450
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:55,859
Wait.

451
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:58,888
You say you can
help us get away?

452
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,901
lt's possible.

453
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:02,334
How?

454
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:08,836
One second.

455
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:31,429
The station Security Chief's
a shape-shifter.

456
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:33,456
You can never be too careful.

457
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:42,006
l take it you know
what a, um, cloaking device is.

458
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:44,010
Well, l have one.

459
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:46,410
lt's not in the best
of condition

460
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:48,312
but it'll work
for about 15 minutes.

461
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:50,249
Long enough to get you
away from here.

462
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:51,444
Sounds expensive.

463
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:53,316
We don't have much latinum.

464
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:55,288
What we do h-have...
is yours.

465
00:22:55,322 --> 00:22:58,155
Exactly how much latinum
are we talking about?

466
00:22:58,192 --> 00:22:59,625
No, forget l said that.

467
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,093
l don't want your money.

468
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:03,562
Consider the cloaking device...
a gift.

469
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:04,859
l'm surprised.

470
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:06,798
Ferengis aren't known
for their generosity.

471
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:09,928
Oh, we are a deeply
misunderstood race.

472
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,870
You may have saved our lives.

473
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:14,100
Our movement owes you
a debt of gratitude.

474
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:16,132
And l know exactly
how you can repay me.

475
00:23:16,176 --> 00:23:18,269
You have to convince Natima
to stay here.

476
00:23:18,312 --> 00:23:21,611
The Professor will never
agree to stay behind.

477
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:27,918
No Natima, no cloaking device,
and no way off this station.

478
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:29,081
She won't do it.

479
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:30,818
You'll have
to talk her into it.

480
00:23:30,858 --> 00:23:34,919
After all, you're the ones
the Cardassians are after.

481
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:36,156
He's right.

482
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:39,165
She shouldn't have to risk
her life for our crimes.

483
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,666
l suppose we could ask her.

484
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:42,601
Don't ask her; tell her.

485
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:44,001
We will.

486
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:45,835
We'll do our best.

487
00:23:45,873 --> 00:23:48,000
l'm sure you will.

488
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:52,846
l shudder to think
what would happen

489
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,849
if the military got
its hands on you.

490
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:58,681
Meet us at our quarters
in an hour.

491
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,050
l'll be there.

492
00:24:08,162 --> 00:24:09,652
Come in.

493
00:24:14,668 --> 00:24:16,636
Where are Rekelen and Hogue?

494
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,638
They're waiting at the ship.

495
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:20,139
Perfect.

496
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:23,473
l know my quarters may seem
a little crowded at first

497
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,671
but tomorrow morning,
l'll put in a request

498
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:26,805
for something bigger.

499
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,474
That won't be necessary.

500
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:29,846
All right.

501
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:31,475
lf you want your own quarters

502
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:33,486
to start out with,
l can arrange that, too.

503
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,715
l mean, l'm not staying.

504
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:36,882
Now, hold on.

505
00:24:36,924 --> 00:24:40,451
Your students and l
have an agreement.

506
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:45,658
They get the cloaking device
and you stay with me.

507
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:47,667
That way, everyone's happy.

508
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,566
Quark, you say you love me.

509
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:51,901
Then give me
that cloaking device

510
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:53,668
and let me be on my way.

511
00:24:53,707 --> 00:24:57,006
And let you disappear
out of my life again?

512
00:24:57,077 --> 00:24:58,840
l'm not part of your life.

513
00:24:58,879 --> 00:24:59,903
But you are.

514
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:01,005
You always have been.

515
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:02,242
Don't you understand?

516
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:04,375
Since you left me,
not a day goes by

517
00:25:04,418 --> 00:25:06,215
that l don't
regret what l did.

518
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:08,778
And now you're asking
me to lose you again!

519
00:25:08,822 --> 00:25:10,949
You lost me a long time ago.

520
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:14,722
All right, then say it.

521
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:15,956
Let me hear you say

522
00:25:15,996 --> 00:25:18,487
there isn't a spark
of love left in you.

523
00:25:18,532 --> 00:25:20,557
There isn't a spark
of love left in me.

524
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:21,693
l heard that.

525
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:22,724
What?

526
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,794
You hesitated.

527
00:25:23,837 --> 00:25:25,771
Admit it-- you still care.

528
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:27,967
Quark, l don't
have time for this.

529
00:25:28,008 --> 00:25:29,441
Give me that cloaking device.

530
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:30,443
l can't.

531
00:25:30,477 --> 00:25:33,503
l won't let you go.

532
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:35,841
Quark.

533
00:25:37,184 --> 00:25:39,778
l didn't want to have
to get it this way

534
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,880
but l need that device.

535
00:25:42,923 --> 00:25:44,788
Give it to me.

536
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:46,554
Now.

537
00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:49,459
Or what?

538
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,790
You'll shoot me?

539
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:56,166
lf l have to.

540
00:25:57,304 --> 00:26:00,000
Then go ahead and shoot.

541
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:21,571
Quark, Quark?
Are you all right?

542
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:23,512
You shot me.

543
00:26:23,547 --> 00:26:25,742
Well, l didn't mean to.
lt was an accident.

544
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:27,512
l've never fired
a phaser before.

545
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:28,916
l barely touched the tri...

546
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:30,850
Careful.

547
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,918
lt hurts?

548
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:35,491
Oh, she wants
to know if it hurts.

549
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:36,686
Of course it hurts.

550
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:38,456
lt's supposed to hurt--
it's a phaser.

551
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,293
l made sure it was
on the first setting.

552
00:26:40,331 --> 00:26:41,355
How considerate of you.

553
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:43,423
Should l get a doctor?

554
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,025
lt's okay.

555
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:47,594
Maybe if you rub it...

556
00:26:47,638 --> 00:26:50,766
Oh, Quark, l'm sorry.

557
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:52,366
Really?

558
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,377
Yes, for everything

559
00:26:54,411 --> 00:26:56,208
for all those horrible things
l said.

560
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,942
You really didn't mean them?

561
00:26:58,015 --> 00:26:59,573
l love you, Quark.

562
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:03,747
l've always loved you,
even when l hated you.

563
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:13,456
Natima.

564
00:27:13,497 --> 00:27:15,192
l've missed you.

565
00:27:15,232 --> 00:27:16,893
l missed you so much.

566
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:19,731
Being with you was
the happiest time of my life.

567
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,169
And now we're together again

568
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:24,299
and we have the rest
of our lives to be happy.

569
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:27,504
l wish it was that easy.

570
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,809
But it can be, if you let it.

571
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:33,146
l'm not the same person
l was seven years ago.

572
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,583
l have responsibilities.

573
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:36,176
l'll share them with you.

574
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,188
The movement is my life now.

575
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,156
l don't have time
for anything else.

576
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,455
We'll make the time.

577
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:45,757
You're a woman, Natima.

578
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:47,229
Believe me, l know.

579
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:50,233
And it's not right
for you to be alone.

580
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:52,531
l-l'm not alone, l...

581
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,130
l have my students...

582
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:57,299
my dreams for
a better Cardassia.

583
00:27:57,341 --> 00:27:59,775
But are dreams enough?

584
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,802
Can dreams make you laugh?

585
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:04,541
Can dreams hold
you close at night?

586
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,709
No!

587
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,548
But my life demands
l make certain sacrifices.

588
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,747
And you've made them

589
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:13,086
but it doesn't mean
you can't be happy.

590
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:16,889
We did have fun together,
didn't we?

591
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:20,555
Remember the day l installed
my first holosuite?

592
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,463
l'd never been in one before.

593
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:26,560
l still have that program--
the Picnic on Rhymus Major.

594
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,265
Two suns in the sky.

595
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:30,432
The sound of the waterfalls.

596
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:32,601
The whisper of flitterbird
wings over our heads.

597
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:35,908
You painted my face with honey.

598
00:28:35,946 --> 00:28:40,110
And a Mordian butterfly
landed on your nose.

599
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:45,417
And a Mordian butterfly
got stuck on my nose.

600
00:28:45,456 --> 00:28:50,325
His wings were beating
almost as fast as my heart.

601
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,852
Those were good times.

602
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:54,454
The best.

603
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:58,764
And we can have them back again.

604
00:28:58,802 --> 00:29:02,101
l'll give the cloaking
device to your students.

605
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:04,573
Once they're gone, you'll be
safe and we can be together.

606
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:06,303
l can't just abandon them.

607
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:07,867
They need me.

608
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:09,946
l need you.

609
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,311
Listen to me, Natima

610
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:17,320
you've done enough
for the movement.

611
00:29:17,354 --> 00:29:18,878
You lit the match.

612
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:20,446
Let them carry the torch.

613
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:22,083
Or are you saying

614
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:24,492
that the movement won't
survive without you?

615
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:25,688
Of course it will.

616
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,253
Then let it

617
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:31,428
and let us have the
happiness we deserve.

618
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:34,869
You really do love me,
don't you?

619
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:38,898
With all that l am, Natima...

620
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:41,001
forever.

621
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,213
Will you stay?

622
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:52,711
Yes, Quark, l'll stay.

623
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:56,419
You don't know how l've waited
to hear you say that.

624
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,698
Enter.

625
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,062
Professor Lang.

626
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:08,731
Not now, Odo.

627
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:10,399
Can't you see we're busy?

628
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,932
l apologize
for the interruption

629
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:16,308
but l'm afraid, madam,
that you are under arrest.

630
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,314
l'm what?

631
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,315
On what charge?

632
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,907
Commander Sisko will explain.

633
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,282
l'm truly sorry.

634
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,286
Now, hold on...

635
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,311
Quark, it's all right.

636
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:51,337
Commander, would
you please explain

637
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,906
what we're doing here?

638
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,382
l'm afraid all of you

639
00:30:58,422 --> 00:31:00,856
are to be turned over
to the Cardassian government.

640
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:03,052
You can't do that.

641
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:04,651
l wish l didn't have to

642
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:06,629
but Cardassia
has offered to release

643
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:10,121
half a dozen Bajoran prisoners
in exchange for you.

644
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:11,600
And you've agreed to this?

645
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:14,763
The Bajoran Provisional
Government has agreed to it.

646
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:16,170
A Cardassian transport

647
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:19,505
will deliver the Bajoran
prisoners within five hours.

648
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:23,172
Commander, you have no idea
what they'll do to us.

649
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,078
We're the ones they're after.

650
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:26,776
At least let Professor Lang go.

651
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:29,945
l'd like nothing better,
but the Provisional Government

652
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:33,047
has ordered you all
to be turned over.

653
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,955
l'm fighting this
every way l can.

654
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:37,552
l'm not ready to give up yet.

655
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:40,654
But in the end,
this is a Bajoran station

656
00:31:40,697 --> 00:31:43,461
and l have to abide
by their decision

657
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,867
no matter how much
l disagree with it.

658
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,750
How the mighty have fallen.

659
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:03,912
Toran?

660
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:06,080
lt's Gul Toran now.

661
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:09,922
They made you a Gul.

662
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,655
l didn't realize the situation

663
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:13,788
on Cardassia had gotten
so desperate.

664
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,698
l find your bitterness
extremely gratifying.

665
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:19,167
l'm glad to see
that you're adjusting

666
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:20,329
so poorly to exile.

667
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:24,500
Actually, l'm finding
my time here quite illuminating.

668
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:27,203
Then l don't suppose
you'd be interested

669
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:29,405
in going home again?

670
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:31,311
Am l to be rewarded

671
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:33,316
for informing
the Central Command

672
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,808
about the presence of Hogue
and Rekelen on the station?

673
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,549
Perhaps.

674
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,087
But only after you see to it

675
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:45,526
that they don't leave
this station alive.

676
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:48,463
But l suggested
a prisoner exchange

677
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,729
and the Central Command agreed.

678
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,530
l convinced them otherwise.

679
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:53,968
And they listened to you?

680
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:56,631
My voice is less tarnished
than yours.

681
00:32:56,673 --> 00:32:59,574
Kill them, and all you
do is create martyrs.

682
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,511
You overestimate
their importance.

683
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:04,537
And how do you
propose to arrange

684
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:06,208
this unfortunate incident?

685
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,741
l'm sure you'll think
of something.

686
00:33:08,785 --> 00:33:10,776
You always did in the past.

687
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:12,049
Don't you see?

688
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:15,081
Lang's death
will benefit us both.

689
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,524
Unless, of course

690
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,428
you intend to spend the rest
of your life as a tailor.

691
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:22,125
l see your point.

692
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:23,826
l knew you would.

693
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,990
Odo, we have to talk.

694
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:40,755
l'm busy.
Come back later.

695
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:43,491
Later will be too late.

696
00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:48,230
<i>l, The Jury,</i>
by Mickey Spillane?

697
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:51,295
Chief O'Brien loaned it to me.

698
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:54,331
This better be important, Quark.

699
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,172
lt is.

700
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,907
Odo, you have to let Natima
and her students go.

701
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,242
Do l?

702
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:04,581
Those students could be
the key to a new Cardassia

703
00:34:04,618 --> 00:34:08,213
a Cardassia free of
military rule and oppression.

704
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,450
Now, since when have you become

705
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:13,051
so interested
in Cardassian politics?

706
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,289
A freer, more open society
on Cardassia

707
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,229
would benefit
this entire sector

708
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,755
and it would be great
for business.

709
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,963
So, wanting me to free
Natima and those students

710
00:34:23,003 --> 00:34:26,439
is strictly a financial
consideration on your part.

711
00:34:26,474 --> 00:34:27,964
Now, Odo...

712
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:29,305
don't allow my greed

713
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:31,868
to keep you from doing
the right thing.

714
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:34,506
l know you better
than you think, Quark.

715
00:34:34,548 --> 00:34:36,209
This isn't about Cardassia

716
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,878
and for once, it's not
even about profit.

717
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:41,251
This is about Professor Lang.

718
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,483
You're right.

719
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:45,287
lt is.

720
00:34:45,326 --> 00:34:46,816
Her life is in jeopardy

721
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:49,989
as long as Rekelen and Hogue
are on the station.

722
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,431
Now, why didn't you
tell me that before?

723
00:34:57,772 --> 00:35:00,366
What was l supposed to say?

724
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:02,035
That l love her?

725
00:35:02,076 --> 00:35:05,170
That l would do
anything for her?

726
00:35:05,212 --> 00:35:08,306
That without her,
my life would be meaningless.

727
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:12,217
Sure, l could say those things,
but what good would it do?

728
00:35:12,253 --> 00:35:14,721
How could l expect you
to understand?

729
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:17,053
You've never had
those feelings.

730
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:18,649
You don't know what it means

731
00:35:18,692 --> 00:35:20,683
to really care
about another person.

732
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:22,195
You've never been in love.

733
00:35:22,229 --> 00:35:24,424
You've got all the emotions
of a stone.

734
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:29,360
No offense.

735
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:32,031
Go on.

736
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:36,900
Listen to me, Odo.

737
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:41,480
You do this for me,
and l promise you

738
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,609
there'll be no more secrets
between us.

739
00:35:44,652 --> 00:35:49,089
l'll tell you about
every underhanded deal

740
00:35:49,123 --> 00:35:53,082
every lying scheme,
every dirty trick

741
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:56,528
my brother Rom's involved in.

742
00:35:56,564 --> 00:36:01,467
Well... since you put it
that way

743
00:36:01,502 --> 00:36:04,062
l'm not interested.

744
00:36:05,606 --> 00:36:08,598
Okay.

745
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:11,702
Okay, let me put it another way.

746
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,810
Do it for me.

747
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:16,146
For you?

748
00:36:16,183 --> 00:36:17,514
That's right.

749
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,179
For all the years
we've known each other

750
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,519
for everything we've
been through together.

751
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:25,525
You say you know me
better than anyone else.

752
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,856
Well, l know you.

753
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:30,159
Sure, sometimes we're
on opposite sides

754
00:36:30,197 --> 00:36:33,132
but that doesn't mean
that we aren't close.

755
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:34,691
l never told you this, Odo

756
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,635
but l consider you
as dear to me

757
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,103
as my brother.

758
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,767
And l've seen how well
you treat him.

759
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,474
Odo...

760
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:51,985
look at me.

761
00:36:56,123 --> 00:36:57,385
Look at me.

762
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,324
l'm on my knees.

763
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,227
l'm begging you.

764
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,231
l don't care why you do it.

765
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,994
Pick any reason you want

766
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:08,934
but please let Natima
and the others go.

767
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:12,665
All right, l'll do it.

768
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:13,730
You will?

769
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:16,140
But not for you.

770
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:19,202
Turning Hogue and Rekelen over
to the Cardassians

771
00:37:19,246 --> 00:37:20,770
would mean their deaths.

772
00:37:20,814 --> 00:37:22,839
l've read their files,
and nothing they've done

773
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,350
warrants that kind
of punishment.

774
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:29,618
l'll free them, Quark,
but only in the name of justice.

775
00:37:29,657 --> 00:37:31,147
Justice.

776
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:33,853
That was going to be
my next suggestion.

777
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:40,392
So, you're not really
doing this for me?

778
00:37:40,434 --> 00:37:41,401
That's right.

779
00:37:41,435 --> 00:37:43,369
Then l don't owe you a thing.
Thank you!

780
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:46,430
You'll never know
how much this means to me.

781
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:49,874
Let go.

782
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,377
Sorry.

783
00:37:51,412 --> 00:37:54,040
Uh... now, um, let's hurry

784
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:57,141
before you change your mind.

785
00:37:57,184 --> 00:37:58,776
One question.

786
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,810
How do you expect
Rekelen and Hogue

787
00:38:00,854 --> 00:38:02,321
to get past that war ship?

788
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:03,345
Uh...

789
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,516
Uh-huh...

790
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:07,527
l knew you had
a cloaking device.

791
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:11,622
l always said you were
too smart for me, Odo.

792
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,838
Quark-- what are
you doing here?

793
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:20,907
Getting you out.

794
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:26,407
Thank you.

795
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,882
Good luck.

796
00:38:33,988 --> 00:38:35,615
l've installed
the cloaking device

797
00:38:35,656 --> 00:38:37,021
in the central
engine core.

798
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:38,456
You can activate
it from the Bridge

799
00:38:38,492 --> 00:38:40,460
as soon as the mooring
clamps are released.

800
00:38:40,494 --> 00:38:42,689
Then, l suggest you take
your ship to warp 8

801
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,197
and don't look back.

802
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:49,293
Now, please, make
your good-byes brief.

803
00:38:49,336 --> 00:38:51,327
Oh, what's the rush?

804
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,966
You've betrayed us.

805
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:58,876
No.

806
00:38:58,979 --> 00:39:02,972
Don't-- l'd hate to ruin
such a... nice suit.

807
00:39:06,186 --> 00:39:08,017
Why are you doing this?

808
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:11,081
Oh, exile tends to wear
a bit thin after a while

809
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:13,821
even with surroundings
as pleasant as these.

810
00:39:13,861 --> 00:39:17,695
Fine, take them,
but leave Natima alone.

811
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:18,698
Quark!

812
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,199
No, he's right.

813
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:21,826
We're the fugitives, not you.

814
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:23,632
You see, they agree with me.

815
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:27,505
Unfortunately, it's not their
decision to make, nor mine.

816
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:30,339
Professor Lang, however minor
her role in this matter

817
00:39:30,377 --> 00:39:33,437
has come to the attention
of the Central Command.

818
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,176
Do you think killing us
will change anything?

819
00:39:36,216 --> 00:39:39,208
Cardassia is slipping out
of the hands of the military.

820
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:41,016
and nothing you do
will prevent it.

821
00:39:41,055 --> 00:39:43,046
Madam, l am not here
to debate you.

822
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,786
Garak, if you harm
these people, l'll see to it

823
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:47,453
that Commander Sisko
prosecutes you

824
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:49,792
to the fullest extent
of the law.

825
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,821
Which brings up another issue.

826
00:39:51,865 --> 00:39:54,527
Quark, things would have gone
much easier

827
00:39:54,568 --> 00:39:56,160
if you'd taken my advice

828
00:39:56,203 --> 00:39:58,967
and not gotten involved
with these people.

829
00:39:59,006 --> 00:40:01,873
l was already involved.

830
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:03,740
l know.
A pity, really.

831
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,803
Personally,
l rather like you, Quark.

832
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:09,315
You mean, you're going
to shoot me, too?

833
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:12,580
Before l became a tailor,
l lived by a simple motto:

834
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,986
Never let sentiment
get in the way of your work.

835
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:18,651
A bit of a cliché,
but true, nonetheless.

836
00:40:18,692 --> 00:40:21,252
l'll keep that in mind.

837
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:25,629
Well, then, although l admit
it's against my better judgment

838
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:29,796
l'm afraid l must carry out the
verdict of the Central Command.

839
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:31,668
But you admit
that they're wrong.

840
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:34,674
Why don't you stand up
for what you believe in?

841
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:39,475
More to the point,
what do you believe in, Garak?

842
00:40:39,513 --> 00:40:40,775
What are you doing here, Toran?

843
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:41,985
Making sure that you
carry out your assignment.

844
00:40:42,118 --> 00:40:46,817
l suspected that two years
living among the Bajorans

845
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:48,050
would make you soft.

846
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:49,422
l see that l was right.

847
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:51,689
You've never been right
about anything.

848
00:40:51,728 --> 00:40:53,161
Now, step aside, Toran

849
00:40:53,196 --> 00:40:55,892
and allow me to finish
this sorry business.

850
00:40:55,932 --> 00:40:58,457
l will take over from here.

851
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:01,095
Why?
So you can take the credit

852
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:04,504
and to make sure l remain
in disgrace?

853
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:07,408
l can't believe that you
were once considered clever.

854
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:10,004
Do you think that by completing
this one simple task

855
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:12,640
your reputation will be restored
at Central Command?

856
00:41:12,682 --> 00:41:16,243
No, l suppose not.

857
00:41:16,286 --> 00:41:18,277
Go back to your sewing kit...

858
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:20,755
tailor.

859
00:41:28,498 --> 00:41:32,366
Well, some people
should never be promoted.

860
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:34,870
Well, don't just stand there!

861
00:41:34,904 --> 00:41:36,701
Your ship is waiting.

862
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:38,434
l'm going to see to it
that every Ferengi

863
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:39,965
on this station
shops in your store.

864
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:43,410
Ah, that alone
makes it all worthwhile.

865
00:41:43,446 --> 00:41:46,074
You heard the man.
Get moving.

866
00:41:46,116 --> 00:41:47,845
Thank you.

867
00:41:49,853 --> 00:41:51,218
Both of you.

868
00:41:51,254 --> 00:41:53,347
Yes, yes, yes.
Go, go, and quickly.

869
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:55,721
Keep up the good work.

870
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:16,743
Quark,
l've got to say good-bye.

871
00:42:16,779 --> 00:42:18,212
Oh, just let them go.

872
00:42:18,248 --> 00:42:20,375
lt'll be less painful that way.

873
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:24,443
No, you don't understand.

874
00:42:24,487 --> 00:42:27,479
l have to say good-bye to you.

875
00:42:27,524 --> 00:42:30,084
l'm going with them.

876
00:42:30,126 --> 00:42:32,287
But we had a deal.

877
00:42:32,328 --> 00:42:34,023
l can't stay here.

878
00:42:34,063 --> 00:42:38,124
Maybe one day l can come back,
and we'll be together again

879
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:40,363
but not until my work is done.

880
00:42:40,403 --> 00:42:42,303
So, all l have to do
to get you back

881
00:42:42,338 --> 00:42:45,774
is wait until Cardassia becomes
a free and democratic society?

882
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:52,239
l promise...

883
00:42:52,282 --> 00:42:55,843
l'll make it worth the wait.

884
00:43:06,496 --> 00:43:09,363
l don't suppose
l could come with you.

885
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,092
No, it's not your fight.

886
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:16,367
Besides, l could never
live with myself

887
00:43:16,406 --> 00:43:18,135
if something happened to you.

888
00:43:18,174 --> 00:43:22,270
l need to know that
you're here, safe.

889
00:43:22,312 --> 00:43:27,045
That way, a part of me
will always be safe, too.

890
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:38,358
l love you, Quark.

891
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:40,419
l always will.

892
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:58,337
l love you, too.

893
00:44:01,484 --> 00:44:04,942
l suggest we return
to the Promenade without delay.

894
00:44:04,988 --> 00:44:08,515
You have to tell me.
Why did you do it?

895
00:44:08,558 --> 00:44:10,355
Shoot Toran.

896
00:44:10,393 --> 00:44:12,486
Why did you let
Professor Lang go?

897
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:15,190
l have no choice.
l love her.

898
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,926
And l love Cardassia

899
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:20,060
which is why
l had to do what l did.

900
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:24,165
l don't understand.

901
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:27,335
That's the thing about love.

902
00:44:27,377 --> 00:44:30,437
No one really
understands it, do they?
