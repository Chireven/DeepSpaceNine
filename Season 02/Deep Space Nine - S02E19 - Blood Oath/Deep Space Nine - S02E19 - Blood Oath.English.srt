1
00:00:01,893 --> 00:00:03,485
He only paid for one hour.

2
00:00:03,528 --> 00:00:05,792
He's been in there for three

3
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:07,890
fighting the Battle
of Klachdachbrach

4
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:09,992
or some such thing,
over and over.

5
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:11,866
The Battle
of Klach D'kel Brakt

6
00:00:11,903 --> 00:00:14,838
is a legendary Klingon victory
over the Romulans

7
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:16,170
almost a century ago.

8
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,768
Well, he's been
losing it all afternoon

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,005
and he says
he's not coming out

10
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:22,377
until he wins.

11
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:24,678
l banged on the door,
he sealed himself in.

12
00:00:24,716 --> 00:00:26,513
l threatened
to shut off the power

13
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:28,348
he threatened to kill me.

14
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:29,718
Oh...

15
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,435
Since when did you add
ancient Klingon battles

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,903
to your holosuite programs?

17
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:48,838
The Captain
of the last Klingon ship

18
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:51,399
that went through the wormhole
sold some to me.

19
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:52,467
Ahh...

20
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,842
l know, l know.

21
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,347
lt's brutal...
it's violent.

22
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:57,905
lt's bloody.

23
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:01,043
But to the Klingons,
it's entertainment.

24
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:02,144
Shut off the power.

25
00:01:02,254 --> 00:01:03,482
He'll kill you.

26
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,888
No, he said he'll kill you.

27
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:07,789
Shut it off.

28
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,504
<i>chay'pen Aha'bA?</i>

29
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:29,477
<i>Ar ghot k'Nel D'kulluH</i>

30
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:32,244
<i>marg raH gol low!</i>

31
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:39,551
You dare interrupt the Battle
of Klach D'kel Brakt

32
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:42,059
you Ferengi <i>k'pekt!</i>

33
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,530
The battle is over.

34
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,430
The people are
waiting to celebrate

35
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:49,434
your victory.

36
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:51,231
They are?

37
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:55,131
Lead the way, then!

38
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:37,906
How did you get in here?

39
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,849
l am Koloth.

40
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,648
That doesn't answer
my question.

41
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:43,278
Yes, it does.

42
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:45,789
What are the charges
against him?

43
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:47,416
Charges?

44
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,188
No charges.

45
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,024
He's today's guest of honor.

46
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:55,965
You must be a very brave man
to attempt humor

47
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:59,596
at the expense
of a Klingon <i>Dahar</i> Master.

48
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,302
l apologize.

49
00:03:04,342 --> 00:03:06,537
No offense intended.

50
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:15,012
Kor!

51
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,882
Sir...

52
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:22,154
if you'll wake up

53
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:24,856
l'll release you
into your friend's custody.

54
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:26,193
Oh.

55
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,128
Oh, Koloth.

56
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:32,801
<i>wlj jup...</i>

57
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,169
my old friend.

58
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,297
Oh, l knew you'd be here.

59
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,674
You disgrace yourself
and our purpose.

60
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:42,077
l do not go into battle

61
00:03:42,113 --> 00:03:47,676
with one whose honor is
washed away in brestanti ale.

62
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,016
Keep him!

63
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:05,310
Security reassignments, Major.

64
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:07,438
Sorry it took so long.

65
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,209
lt's been a Klingon afternoon.

66
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:10,511
''A Klingon afternoon''?

67
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,814
Every time Klingons
visit the station

68
00:06:12,852 --> 00:06:15,047
l wind up
with a Klingon afternoon.

69
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:18,181
But this is definitely one
l'll cherish forever.

70
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:21,388
There's a drunken Klingon
in my holding cell--

71
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:22,986
must be
a hundred years old--

72
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,291
singing battle songs.

73
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:25,491
Even his best friend--

74
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:27,056
who's probably
150 years old--

75
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,000
won't have anything
to do with him

76
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:31,902
so l get the pleasure
of listening to his repertoire.

77
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,498
Kor, <i>Dahar</i> Master
of the Klingons.

78
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,168
Did you say ''Kor''?

79
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,404
That's what he announced,
right after winning

80
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:41,505
the Battle of Klach
D'kel Brakt at Quark's.

81
00:06:41,548 --> 00:06:43,379
What is he doing here?

82
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,350
Did you get his friend's name?

83
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,511
Was it Kang?

84
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:47,577
No, it was...

85
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:50,055
-Koloth.
-Koloth.

86
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:52,785
Come with me, Odo.

87
00:06:54,494 --> 00:07:00,364
<i>B'aski't Kor, B'askr'ip Kor</i>

88
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,531
<i>KoHman-a-tl, B'aski't Kor.</i>

89
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:10,643
Hello, Kor.

90
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:12,872
l am thirsty.

91
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,539
Let him out.

92
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:15,707
Lieutenant...

93
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:17,410
l'll take responsibility.

94
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,719
l am very thirsty.

95
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:26,089
Kor, do you remember
Curzon Dax?

96
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:29,223
Curzon?

97
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:32,197
Oh, my dear friend Curzon?

98
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:36,896
l lift my <i>ghoptu</i>
to Curzon Dax, mm-hmm.

99
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:42,738
And l, who was Curzon Dax,
lift my <i>ghoptu</i> to you.

100
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:45,210
Oh.

101
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:48,237
Scorcher burn
on your 14th rib...

102
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:49,680
Huh?

103
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:53,880
And your left <i>QiVon</i> aches

104
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,980
every time your ship
hits warp eight.

105
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:58,957
Dax?!

106
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:03,888
My C-Curzon?

107
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:07,932
After 81 years, l...

108
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:11,403
l find you a <i>kyamo-</i>
looking woman.

109
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:13,766
Kiss me!

110
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:15,832
How about just
a great big hug?

111
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,174
Oh, Curzon,
my beloved old friend.

112
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:21,203
l'm Jadzia now.

113
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,581
Oh, well, Jadzia,
my beloved old friend.

114
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:30,054
Come on, Kor,
let's go find Koloth.

115
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,785
Koloth's here?

116
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:51,608
Look at him.

117
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:55,080
He practices cuts and thrusts
even with his food.

118
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:56,843
Little children do that.

119
00:08:56,883 --> 00:09:00,785
A sharp knife is nothing

120
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,185
without a sharp eye.

121
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:03,416
Ooh.

122
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,185
Mmm, it's been 40 years

123
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:07,716
since even his good eye
was sharp.

124
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:10,457
Ah, it's luck
when you hit the plate.

125
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:12,727
l see that the Federation
insults us

126
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,996
by sending a Lieutenant
to greet us.

127
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:16,729
You never had much use
for the Federation

128
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,896
did you, Koloth?

129
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:19,598
l used to call you

130
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,870
<i>D'akturak,</i> ''ice man,''
because no proposal--

131
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:26,037
no matter how reasonable,
no matter how much

132
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:28,376
it favored the
Klingon Empire--

133
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:30,144
would satisfy you.

134
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:32,048
You were the toughest man

135
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:35,519
l ever faced across
the negotiations table.

136
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:41,657
Do you not recognize
our old friend, Dax, hmm?

137
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,291
Dax?

138
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:54,096
Curzon's dead, but Dax
is alive as a part of me.

139
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,544
This is a mistake.

140
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,638
Kang must not have known.

141
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:04,081
Ah, but what
a beautiful mistake, hmm?

142
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:05,481
ls Kang coming?

143
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:07,281
Of course he's coming.

144
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,222
He's brought the four of us
back together after 81 years.

145
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:13,418
Could it possibly mean
that he's...

146
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,586
Yes.

147
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:17,619
That is exactly what it means.

148
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:20,462
l have found the Albino.

149
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,967
Ah.

150
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:30,873
Kang, do you remember

151
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,606
the first time we sat
together over <i>bahgol?</i>

152
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,273
lt was the Korvat colony.

153
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:37,749
The Federation
and the Klingon Empire

154
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,046
were still enemies.

155
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:43,044
l never sat with you
before today.

156
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,216
l am Dax

157
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:47,522
godfather of your son.

158
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,892
You are no one's godfather.

159
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:53,330
l am Dax,
godfather of your son.

160
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:58,303
So, you are the same Dax
who took a blood oath with us

161
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:00,431
to seek vengeance?

162
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:03,704
Don't mistake a new face
for a new soul, Kang.

163
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:06,007
l still feel at one
with your family

164
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:08,070
just as l did
eight decades ago.

165
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:11,275
l hope one day, you'll embrace
me as a brother again.

166
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,784
Brother, ha!

167
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:14,753
Oh, brother, sister,
what's the difference?

168
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:16,084
We're all here now.

169
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:18,282
Speak to us, Kang.
Where is he?

170
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:21,816
Where did you find
the Albino?

171
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:25,627
Seven years ago... on Dayos lV

172
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:30,534
l met one of the Albino's
discarded wives.

173
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,095
l fed and clothed her.

174
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:36,905
l told her
the story of our sons.

175
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:41,073
She still feared him,
and told me nothing.

176
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:43,742
Three months ago, she died.

177
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:48,982
A week afterward, an amulet
she wore around her neck

178
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:52,253
was delivered to me
by messenger.

179
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:57,229
ln it was the location
of the Albino's sanctuary.

180
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:00,232
Are you certain
that he's still there?

181
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:03,963
l have confirmed it
with traders who supply him.

182
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:07,871
lt is on the fourth planet
of the Secarus system.

183
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:09,807
He has been hiding there

184
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:12,538
for nearly a quarter
of a century.

185
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:15,013
Hiding from us, no doubt.

186
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:18,916
l have been told he only has
40 men in his compound.

187
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:22,513
Evidently, he's become very lax
in his waning years.

188
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:25,488
The fool.

189
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:27,618
l wouldn't count
on information from traders.

190
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,560
The Albino might have
told them what to say

191
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:30,756
if anyone asks questions.

192
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:31,991
She's right.

193
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:33,896
The traders may
already have warned him

194
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:35,093
that we are coming.

195
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:38,899
They will never
warn anyone ever again.

196
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:42,305
This time, we will reach
the Albino

197
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:47,302
and when we do, l will cut
his heart out and eat it

198
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:51,443
while he watches me
with his dying breath.

199
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:05,063
l did not know, of course.

200
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:06,655
About Curzon?

201
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:10,726
l did not want to risk
contacting you by subspace.

202
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,237
l don't blame you.

203
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:15,672
That's how the Albino learned
we were coming to Galdonterre.

204
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,404
He has ears that reach
across the galaxy.

205
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:20,969
l don't know how.

206
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:24,575
Tell me about
my good friend, Curzon.

207
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:27,347
Did he die
an honorable death?

208
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:29,617
He died
in a hospital room

209
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:31,556
yelling at doctors
and friends

210
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:33,616
who were trying
to keep him alive

211
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,457
for one more miserable day.

212
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:37,258
Oh, that's a pity.

213
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:39,093
He was a good man.

214
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,532
He deserved to die in battle.

215
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:46,193
lt pains me that l will never
see him again in this life.

216
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:50,854
Curzon was decorated many times
for his diplomatic achievements

217
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:54,060
but no honor touched him
as deeply as yours.

218
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,466
For a Klingon to choose
a Federation official

219
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,904
to be the godfather
of his son...

220
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,845
Curzon Dax opened
the door to peace.

221
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,337
He was the first Federation
diplomat l ever met

222
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:13,012
who truly seemed to understand
the Klingon nature.

223
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,180
Well, there was always a bit
of Klingon nature in Curzon.

224
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:20,455
His blood oath with you
was very important to him.

225
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:27,693
Would you eat from the heart
of the Albino, Jadzia Dax?

226
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,725
l know about the Trills

227
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,898
from my long friendship
with Curzon.

228
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,736
And l know that each new host

229
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:37,141
has no obligation
to past commitments.

230
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,975
And l know
that a Klingon blood oath

231
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,640
can never be broken.

232
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,946
The old Klingon ways
are passing.

233
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:50,354
There was a time
when l was a young man

234
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,157
the mere mention of the Klingon
Empire made worlds tremble.

235
00:14:55,195 --> 00:15:00,030
Now our warriors are opening
restaurants and serving <i>racht</i>

236
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:04,333
to the grandchildren
of men l slaughtered in battle.

237
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,272
Things are not
what they used to be

238
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,332
not even the blood oath.

239
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,536
l know you, Kang.

240
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,169
You don't believe that.

241
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:15,613
What l believe
is no longer relevant.

242
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,948
You are released
from Curzon's oath.

243
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,783
You owe nothing to any of us.

244
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,186
Are you still reading

245
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,354
a plasma leak
in Lower Pylon One?

246
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,159
l can't seem to find it now.

247
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:32,722
lt's been intermittent.

248
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,927
Let me do
a high-resolution scan.

249
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,631
Kira...

250
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:39,934
Uh-huh?

251
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:43,805
How many people did you kill?

252
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,573
What?

253
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,276
While you were
in the underground.

254
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,784
Too many.

255
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,221
Were they all...
faceless Cardassians

256
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,989
or did you know
who you were killing?

257
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,859
Why are we talking
about this?

258
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:05,694
lf it bothers you,
we can stop.

259
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:06,994
lt bothers me.

260
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,329
l'm sorry.

261
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,001
Why?

262
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,475
Were you thinking
about killing somebody?

263
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:20,002
Me?

264
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,313
Tell me.

265
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:29,447
l don't know
what you're talking about.

266
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,922
Tell me.

267
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:43,367
80 years ago, there was
a band of depredators

268
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:47,931
led by an Albino
raiding Klingon colonies.

269
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:52,035
Three Klingon warships
were sent to stop him.

270
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:56,981
One of the Captains was
a close friend of Curzon's.

271
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,451
The mission was successful.

272
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:04,685
Most of them were captured,
but the Albino escaped.

273
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:08,888
ln his last message
to the Klingons

274
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,524
he promised to take revenge

275
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:17,003
on the firstborn of each
of the three Captains.

276
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,562
A few years later,
he kept his word.

277
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:27,207
Somehow, he infected
three innocent children

278
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:32,150
with a genetic virus
that killed them.

279
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,690
One of them was my godson.

280
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,715
l'm sorry.

281
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,027
But, Jadzia...

282
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,462
that was Curzon's godson.

283
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,991
l took a blood oath
to avenge his death.

284
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,401
Curzon took a blood oath.

285
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,107
l can still remember
the boy's funeral.

286
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,578
He was named Dax, for me.

287
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,512
You've found this Albino?

288
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,853
We know where he is.

289
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:13,689
The three Klingons
came here to tell me...

290
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,958
Look, you've said yourself
every new life for a Trill

291
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:18,328
has to be a new life.

292
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:21,528
lf not, you'd wind up
paying off old debts forever.

293
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:24,093
These Klingons can't
possibly expect you

294
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,297
to keep this oath.

295
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,999
No, they don't.

296
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,108
That's just it.

297
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:34,409
They say l have
no obligation to them.

298
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,711
But l do.

299
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,014
l know it, l feel it.

300
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,423
lf not to them,
l owe it to Curzon.

301
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,426
Jadzia--

302
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,397
your questions about my...

303
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,331
experience with killing--

304
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,267
if you're wondering
what it's like...

305
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,534
When you take someone's life

306
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:05,204
you lose a part
of your own, as well.

307
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,218
l need another arm.

308
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,914
Or am l doomed to choose

309
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:19,926
between perfection
and the palate?

310
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:24,061
Let me spare you
that decision.

311
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:27,056
Mmm! Mmm... mmm.

312
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,394
Ah...

313
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,068
<i>majQa'.</i>

314
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,900
To the rescue.

315
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:39,935
Dax, may l present
these two... students

316
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,278
of... Klingon history.

317
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,306
Would you excuse us
for a minute?

318
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,251
Hmm?

319
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:50,484
Ooh, well, only a minute,
my students.

320
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:59,595
Well, you certainly don't
share Curzon's priorities.

321
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,565
About going after the Albino,
l do.

322
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:04,831
Kang and Koloth

323
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,851
don't want me
to come with you.

324
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:09,077
Well, Kang thinks too much.

325
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,418
Koloth doesn't feel enough.

326
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:13,355
And where do you stand?

327
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,619
Huh? Hmm?

328
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:16,286
Oh, of course
you should come.

329
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:18,591
The splendor of fighting
and killing

330
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:20,995
a bloodbath in the cause
of vengeance--

331
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:22,726
who wouldn't want to come?

332
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,701
Would you speak
to them for me?

333
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:28,330
lt means far more to me
than l realized.

334
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:30,932
Hmm, Koloth spends
all his time

335
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:33,409
practicing in the holosuite.

336
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:35,241
He listens to no one.

337
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,978
And if Kang's made up his mind,
there's nothing l can do.

338
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:43,953
And you call yourself
a history teacher?

339
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:46,513
What of your own history?

340
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:49,253
You are Kor, <i>Dahar</i> Master.

341
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:52,558
They cheered you
at Klach D'kel Brakt.

342
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:56,760
Your voice weighed heavily on
the course of Klingon events.

343
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:01,064
You shame me.

344
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:03,630
No, please don't feel that.

345
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:09,508
Huh! The only weight
l carry now, dear comrade

346
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:12,175
is... is my own bulbous body.

347
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:16,312
l... l was once,
if you remember

348
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:19,551
far less than you see...

349
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,754
and far more
than l have become.

350
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:28,759
l'm sorry.

351
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:35,505
My memories are still
of Kor, a great warrior.

352
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:46,416
Quark, you...

353
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,714
devious little <i>Ha'DlBah!</i>

354
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:50,914
Bring wine.

355
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:28,188
Nice of you to stop.

356
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:30,989
l'm coming with you.

357
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:33,530
Curzon Dax was a politician.

358
00:22:33,564 --> 00:22:36,590
lt was a diplomatic ploy
for him to bond himself

359
00:22:36,634 --> 00:22:39,102
to us in a blood oath.

360
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:41,570
That's a lie.

361
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:44,369
Are... you...?

362
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:46,000
l am practicing here.

363
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:47,669
Leave while you can.

364
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:50,908
When you agree that l can
fulfill my part of the oath.

365
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:54,543
Your presence will jeopardize
the rest of us.

366
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:55,984
Leave me.

367
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,853
Computer, l want
a Klingon <i>bat'leth.</i>

368
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:01,414
Tip to tip
1 16 centimeters

369
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:03,324
weight 5.3 kilos

370
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,956
with an exterior hand-gripping
diameter of five centimeters.

371
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:11,364
Blades composite <i>baakonite.</i>

372
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,597
Ah, a warrior's configuration.

373
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:16,697
Now what are you going
to do with it?

374
00:23:18,209 --> 00:23:19,972
l'm going to fight you.

375
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:25,175
And if my hand should slip,
and you should die?

376
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:26,979
Your hand would never slip

377
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:29,349
unless you've become
old and feeble.

378
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:48,465
Come on, Koloth,
surely you can take me down.

379
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:11,724
There is tension
on your face, Koloth.

380
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:14,390
You ought to drink more.

381
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,949
Stand up.

382
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:41,757
Your presence
against the Albino

383
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:45,558
will do honor to our cause.

384
00:24:48,232 --> 00:24:53,534
Well, that's a surprise
from the great stone face.

385
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:55,539
Releasing you
from Curzon's oath

386
00:24:55,573 --> 00:24:56,733
is not enough.

387
00:24:56,774 --> 00:24:58,401
l can see that now.

388
00:24:58,442 --> 00:24:59,409
lt is agreed then.

389
00:24:59,443 --> 00:25:00,740
No!

390
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:04,680
l tell you now, you will
not be part of the quest.

391
00:25:16,527 --> 00:25:18,119
Why do you dismiss her

392
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:20,460
like some useless
<i>t'ooho'mlrah?</i>

393
00:25:20,497 --> 00:25:22,965
We cannot go
to an enemy stronghold

394
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,967
with your sickly chest
announcing us.

395
00:25:25,002 --> 00:25:26,196
There is nothing...

396
00:25:26,237 --> 00:25:28,068
nothing wrong with my chest.

397
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:30,164
Nothing that won't
get us all killed

398
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:31,572
before we reach battle.

399
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:32,576
Come.

400
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,441
Ah, l need no nurse's hand.

401
00:25:51,862 --> 00:25:55,662
You can't deny my right
for vengeance.

402
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:57,860
You try to speak
like a Klingon

403
00:25:57,901 --> 00:26:00,563
but the words do not
fit in your mouth.

404
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:03,038
You said that to me before,
Kang, do you remember?

405
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:06,406
l do not wish to discuss it
any further.

406
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:09,708
The Korvat colony.

407
00:26:09,747 --> 00:26:13,547
First day of negotiations,
l walked out on you

408
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:16,610
right in the middle of that
longwinded speech of yours.

409
00:26:16,654 --> 00:26:19,521
You should have seen
the look on your face.

410
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:21,820
Nobody had ever
had the <i>kajanpak't</i>

411
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:24,259
to show their back
to the great Kang

412
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:25,523
before Curzon did.

413
00:26:25,562 --> 00:26:29,862
l almost killed Curzon
that day.

414
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,563
l knew l had to get you
very, very angry

415
00:26:33,604 --> 00:26:36,471
or my mission wouldn't succeed.

416
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:39,499
Getting you angry with me
was the only way

417
00:26:39,543 --> 00:26:42,239
to begin to create a bond
between us.

418
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:46,648
Curzon understood Klingons.

419
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:48,914
And he also understood
what he was doing

420
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:50,886
when he took
a Klingon blood oath.

421
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:52,980
You can't expect me
to stay here

422
00:26:53,057 --> 00:26:55,491
and not avenge
my own godson's murder.

423
00:26:55,526 --> 00:26:58,962
You can't ask me to live
with that kind of dishonor.

424
00:26:58,996 --> 00:27:01,021
l cannot dishonor myself

425
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:03,533
by allowing you to die
in Curzon's place.

426
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:04,744
Who's talking about dying?

427
00:27:04,877 --> 00:27:09,007
l have no intention of dying.

428
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,418
You dishonor yourself
already, Kang

429
00:27:13,452 --> 00:27:16,421
by placing your honor
above mine.

430
00:27:16,455 --> 00:27:19,390
No Klingon warrior would
leave a comrade behind

431
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:21,256
while he goes off to battle.

432
00:27:23,162 --> 00:27:24,925
Perhaps you're right.

433
00:27:24,997 --> 00:27:28,330
Klingon honor isn't
what it used to be.

434
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:30,858
Are you trying
to anger me again?

435
00:27:30,903 --> 00:27:34,168
You think the same trick
would work twice?

436
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:36,505
l understand Klingons.

437
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,601
All right then, it worked.

438
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,509
Come and fight with us.

439
00:27:40,546 --> 00:27:42,104
Come and be damned.

440
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:49,178
Come in.

441
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:55,294
l was just about
to come see you.

442
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:56,625
No.

443
00:27:56,662 --> 00:27:57,890
No what?

444
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,124
No leave of absence.

445
00:27:59,165 --> 00:28:00,928
Kira shouldn't have told you.

446
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,798
Kira is my First Officer.

447
00:28:02,835 --> 00:28:06,100
l don't have to tell you
what this oath meant to Curzon.

448
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:09,039
Jadzia Dax took an oath, too,
when she joined Starfleet.

449
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:11,009
You're subject to
orders, Lieutenant.

450
00:28:11,043 --> 00:28:12,840
Don't do it, Benjamin.

451
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,905
Don't make me disobey
a direct order.

452
00:28:15,948 --> 00:28:17,677
l never understood this.

453
00:28:17,717 --> 00:28:19,810
l mean, whatever
else Curzon was

454
00:28:19,852 --> 00:28:22,252
he did have
a fundamental morality.

455
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:25,553
He wouldn't condone murder
any more than l would.

456
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:27,456
And yet he swore
to kill this Albino

457
00:28:27,493 --> 00:28:30,053
and now you plan to go out
and kill in his name.

458
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:31,927
What about the laws
of the Federation?

459
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:33,932
The Klingons have
their own set of laws.

460
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,194
This is justice to them.

461
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:36,428
And to you?

462
00:28:36,469 --> 00:28:38,699
l've chosen to respect
their codes of honor

463
00:28:38,738 --> 00:28:40,171
in this matter, yes.

464
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:43,198
You really think
you're capable of doing this?

465
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:46,907
l don't know.

466
00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:49,676
There's only one way
to find out, isn't there?

467
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:51,444
Let's say you are.

468
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:54,317
Let's say you even
survive this insanity.

469
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:56,287
You expect to come back here

470
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:59,985
and resume your duties,
as though nothing's happened?

471
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:04,093
l guess that'll be up to you.

472
00:29:23,983 --> 00:29:26,417
The compound is made
of riddinite.

473
00:29:26,452 --> 00:29:28,818
There are several walls
that separate

474
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:31,687
the main house
from the rest of the grounds.

475
00:29:31,724 --> 00:29:33,624
The main power source is here.

476
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,287
There is an armory there.

477
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:37,921
Any information about

478
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:40,364
the positioning
of the sentries?

479
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,163
They are posted
at standing intervals

480
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:45,864
7 5 meters apart
along the perimeter.

481
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:47,930
Standing, no patrols?

482
00:29:47,974 --> 00:29:49,305
That's what l'm told.

483
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:51,367
Perhaps he thinks
we're already dead

484
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,037
and have stopped chasing him.

485
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,944
Or perhaps he's made
his defenses look weak

486
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:56,207
for our benefit.

487
00:29:56,248 --> 00:29:59,684
Hmm, she may be right.

488
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:02,210
We have to assume
the guards patrol the perimeter.

489
00:30:02,254 --> 00:30:05,485
At 7 5 meters apart, they're out
of eye contact with each other.

490
00:30:05,524 --> 00:30:08,220
He wouldn't be that stupid.

491
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,921
We must expect them to be

492
00:30:09,962 --> 00:30:12,362
no farther than...
50 meters apart.

493
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:14,958
Fine, it makes no difference.

494
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,901
Doesn't it?

495
00:30:16,936 --> 00:30:19,632
lf we assume he has
adequate defenses--

496
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,299
a minimum of 50 guards--

497
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,138
then we should use
a <i>N'yengoren</i> strategy.

498
00:30:24,176 --> 00:30:25,734
No!

499
00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:27,973
l will not sneak
into his bedroom

500
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,275
and murder him
like a <i>kah'plakt.</i>

501
00:30:30,316 --> 00:30:32,614
l want him to see us coming.

502
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:37,520
l say we make a direct attack
boldly through the threshold.

503
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:41,253
The guards will be too scattered
to defend against us.

504
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:44,262
We will overwhelm them
to glorious victory!

505
00:30:44,296 --> 00:30:46,787
Or a glorious death.

506
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,791
lt is a good day to die.

507
00:30:52,805 --> 00:30:55,603
lt is a good day to die.

508
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:57,336
Come on, old comrade.

509
00:30:57,376 --> 00:31:00,971
For the last time,
let's sharpen our blades.

510
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,082
So, we talk about dying again.

511
00:31:10,122 --> 00:31:14,582
A Klingon warrior is
always prepared to die.

512
00:31:14,627 --> 00:31:19,326
Yes, but to invite death
with a direct assault

513
00:31:19,365 --> 00:31:21,959
against a superior force...

514
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:25,401
Kang, what are you doing?

515
00:31:25,438 --> 00:31:28,805
What's really going on here?

516
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:32,242
Loyalty blinds
Kor and Koloth, but not me.

517
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:35,611
This is not a plan for battle.

518
00:31:35,648 --> 00:31:37,639
lt's a plan for suicide.

519
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:41,148
lf it were someone else

520
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:44,645
l might think you were paid
to lure us here.

521
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,918
How can you say that?

522
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,721
l took a blood oath with you.

523
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,752
That's why you didn't
want me to come...

524
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:53,788
because you knew
you were coming to die.

525
00:31:55,968 --> 00:32:01,600
When the amulet arrived
with the location of the Albino

526
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,873
l went to the Secarus system,
to see if it was true.

527
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:12,077
Somehow, the instant l arrived,
the Albino knew l was there.

528
00:32:12,118 --> 00:32:14,609
He contacted me.

529
00:32:14,653 --> 00:32:21,559
He sent an invitation...
to one last glorious battle.

530
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:26,896
He said he was tired
of this lifelong pursuit.

531
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:32,837
He swore to send 40 of his
strongest, most skilled men

532
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:36,399
against us in honorable battle.

533
00:32:36,442 --> 00:32:38,205
And l agreed.

534
00:32:38,244 --> 00:32:40,474
But why?

535
00:32:40,513 --> 00:32:42,743
Because...

536
00:32:42,781 --> 00:32:46,581
this is our last chance.

537
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,917
lf we cannot reach the Albino

538
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:51,980
we can at least die
an honorable death

539
00:32:52,091 --> 00:32:54,082
trying to reach him.

540
00:32:54,126 --> 00:33:00,929
A death a Klingon
<i>Dahar</i> Master deserves.

541
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:02,297
You know what, Kang?

542
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:05,531
l think you Klingons
embrace death too easily.

543
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:07,801
You treat death like a lover.

544
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,867
l think living is
a lot more attractive.

545
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:13,776
l think an honorable victory

546
00:33:13,812 --> 00:33:16,110
is better
than an honorable defeat.

547
00:33:16,148 --> 00:33:19,709
l know the Albino's defenses.

548
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:22,482
There is no chance
of victory here.

549
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:24,421
What if they had no phasers?

550
00:33:24,456 --> 00:33:27,118
That might make the odds
a little better

551
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:28,717
don't you think?

552
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:31,195
How do you intend
to disarm them all?

553
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:35,166
When we establish a low orbit,
we modulate your disrupter banks

554
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:38,136
to bombard the compound
with tetryon particles.

555
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:42,573
Every directed energy weapon
would be neutralized.

556
00:33:42,608 --> 00:33:45,168
You're certain
such a thing could be done?

557
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:47,805
Well, if Curzon were here,
you'd be out of luck

558
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:49,871
but Jadzia Dax is
a science officer.

559
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:55,913
We would also be unable
to use our disrupters

560
00:33:55,955 --> 00:34:00,858
but who among them could match
our skills with a <i>bat'leth?</i>

561
00:34:00,893 --> 00:34:03,293
Not many.

562
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:06,924
We're about 40 minutes
from the Secarus system.

563
00:34:07,032 --> 00:34:08,590
l think we should cloak

564
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:12,035
and then you and l, old friend,
should sharpen our blades, too.

565
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:18,400
Perhaps...
it is a good day to live.

566
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:47,882
You say they promised you
an honorable battle...

567
00:34:47,924 --> 00:34:50,722
hand-to-hand combat
at the main threshold.

568
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,727
That's right.

569
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:53,160
Take a look at this.

570
00:34:53,196 --> 00:34:56,632
This indicates a gravitic mine
buried at the main threshold.

571
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,497
Yes, and he plans to detonate it

572
00:34:58,534 --> 00:35:00,468
the moment we enter
the compound.

573
00:35:00,503 --> 00:35:03,734
That's what you get for making
a deal with the devil, Kang.

574
00:35:03,773 --> 00:35:05,172
On the other hand,
this gives us

575
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,039
an advantage we
wouldn't otherwise have.

576
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:09,636
He's expecting us
at the front door.

577
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,874
How do we know
that he's even inside?

578
00:35:11,981 --> 00:35:13,539
Good question.

579
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:16,609
Wait here.

580
00:35:16,652 --> 00:35:18,176
Where are you going?

581
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:20,451
l'm going to find out
if he's inside.

582
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,321
And how do you intend
to do that?

583
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:24,918
l'll ask somebody.

584
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:29,861
We would be wise

585
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:33,232
to shut down his sensor array
before we attack.

586
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:36,261
lt's controlled
from this power station.

587
00:35:36,305 --> 00:35:39,206
Yes, but a power failure
would signal our presence.

588
00:35:39,242 --> 00:35:41,904
At the same time
that you shut down the sensors

589
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:44,037
l'll create a diversion
at the armory

590
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,877
to misdirect their response.

591
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:46,882
Good strategy

592
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,543
but whoever creates
a diversion

593
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:51,052
will have to run across
this field to escape.

594
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:52,213
With all due respect

595
00:35:52,255 --> 00:35:54,621
none of you are as
quick as you once were.

596
00:35:54,657 --> 00:35:56,215
l'll volunteer for that job.

597
00:35:56,259 --> 00:35:57,590
Agreed.

598
00:36:18,748 --> 00:36:23,208
lt seems this is
the best place for entry.

599
00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:24,344
Right here.

600
00:36:24,387 --> 00:36:27,515
l encountered
a helpful lookout.

601
00:36:27,557 --> 00:36:29,525
The Albino is inside.

602
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,528
His overconfidence will
be the death of him.

603
00:36:32,562 --> 00:36:36,225
Well, he's in there now,
but the moment we attack

604
00:36:36,265 --> 00:36:39,530
he will move to a secured
command post here.

605
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:42,060
lt will be midday
in about an hour.

606
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:45,870
Can you create the diversion
in the armory by then?

607
00:36:45,908 --> 00:36:47,899
l think so.

608
00:36:47,977 --> 00:36:50,537
We will be in position
at the powerhouse.

609
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,914
May Kahless guide us
on this day of vengeance.

610
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:24,676
Excuse me?

611
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:27,012
Could you tell me where
the tennis courts are?

612
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:28,209
l seem to be lost.

613
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,891
Huh?

614
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,364
There she is, over there.

615
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:54,137
l'm not firing.

616
00:37:54,176 --> 00:37:55,268
What's wrong?

617
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:56,903
l'm not firing.
l have no power.

618
00:37:56,946 --> 00:37:57,935
Reset, reset!

619
00:38:01,684 --> 00:38:02,651
Report.

620
00:38:02,685 --> 00:38:03,845
The armory's been sabotaged.

621
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:06,046
l've diverted the forward
patrols to that area.

622
00:38:06,088 --> 00:38:07,077
Cancel those orders.

623
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:09,216
Move all guards
to the inner defense line.

624
00:38:09,258 --> 00:38:11,158
Make sure
the power station is secure.

625
00:38:11,193 --> 00:38:12,160
Go.

626
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:13,491
Yes, sir.

627
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:15,190
None of the phasers
are functioning.

628
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:16,858
Not functioning?

629
00:38:16,932 --> 00:38:18,297
We're running
diagnostics now.

630
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:20,461
Use long-range sensors
to check

631
00:38:20,503 --> 00:38:22,869
for interference
from a cloaked ship in orbit.

632
00:38:22,905 --> 00:38:27,171
ln the meantime, have the guards
fix kuttars to their rifles

633
00:38:27,209 --> 00:38:29,871
and prepare
for hand-to-hand combat.

634
00:38:48,564 --> 00:38:50,896
l can't make contact
with the power station.

635
00:38:50,966 --> 00:38:53,901
They must have already broken
through the inner defense line.

636
00:38:54,003 --> 00:38:56,028
Move the perimeter guards
into the house.

637
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:58,540
Sir, without power,
we have no communications.

638
00:38:58,574 --> 00:39:01,065
Then get out there
and tell them yourself!

639
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,136
l don't want that Klingon
filth to get in this...

640
00:39:09,518 --> 00:39:11,645
Look upon your executioners

641
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:13,245
killer of children.

642
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:14,449
Get them!

643
00:39:51,994 --> 00:39:53,552
Koloth!

644
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:03,205
l didn't see him coming.

645
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,831
Even you cannot have eyes

646
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:07,035
in the back of your head,
my friend.

647
00:40:07,076 --> 00:40:08,771
Quiet now... rest.

648
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:10,836
l still have work to do.

649
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:43,443
l will not die before you
do, you thunderous bulk.

650
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:47,245
The story of your courage
will never die.

651
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:49,911
l will sing the story.

652
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:54,753
The children of all Klingons
will know of this day.

653
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,646
You'll die far quicker
than your son did, Kang.

654
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:52,049
No vengeance today, Kang.

655
00:41:55,592 --> 00:41:57,321
And who are you, girl?

656
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,260
You knew me as Curzon Dax.

657
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,492
The Trill, of course.

658
00:42:02,532 --> 00:42:07,526
You're far too young and lovely
to sport such a deadly weapon.

659
00:42:08,705 --> 00:42:11,538
All right then...

660
00:42:12,876 --> 00:42:16,312
use it, if that's
what you came to do.

661
00:42:16,346 --> 00:42:18,780
Kill me in cold blood.

662
00:42:18,815 --> 00:42:21,511
Run me through the belly

663
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:23,382
and cut out my heart.

664
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:27,014
lsn't that what your
blood oath promised?

665
00:42:27,056 --> 00:42:30,958
Or have you lost your
appetite, my dear?

666
00:42:42,572 --> 00:42:47,874
Thank you for saving
the death blow for me.

667
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:51,870
You have honored me
one last time...

668
00:42:51,915 --> 00:42:54,247
godfather to my son.

669
00:43:02,025 --> 00:43:04,994
Where is Koloth?

670
00:43:05,028 --> 00:43:07,622
He's dead.

671
00:43:07,664 --> 00:43:09,222
Oh...

672
00:43:09,265 --> 00:43:13,167
l was right, Dax.

673
00:43:13,203 --> 00:43:16,036
lt is a good day to die.

674
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:22,204
lt's never a good day
to lose a friend.

675
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:35,681
<i>Ki-naH-naH, lo-maytoo</i>

676
00:43:35,725 --> 00:43:43,598
<i>Ki-naH-naH, lo-maytaH...</i>
