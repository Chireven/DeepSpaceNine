1
00:00:02,527 --> 00:00:06,395
Station Log, Stardate 47 573.1.

2
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:07,523
To respond to questions

3
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:09,693
about setting up colonies
near the wormhole

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:13,899
Chief O'Brien and l have set out
to survey nearby star systems.

5
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:16,169
lf it's an imposition...

6
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:17,606
No, sir, it's fine.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,770
You're sure?

8
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,971
l'm sure, Commander.

9
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:23,174
Jake's a good fellow.

10
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:25,182
l'll enjoy working with him.

11
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:27,310
l don't want you to make it
easy for him, Chief.

12
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:30,378
He has to know what it takes
to make it in Starfleet.

13
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:32,322
l'll have him
up to his elbows

14
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:33,881
in thorium grease, sir.

15
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:35,620
lt's not going
to be easy for him.

16
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,959
He placed in the lower
third of his age group

17
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,190
in mechanical aptitude.

18
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:40,630
Oh, good for him.

19
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,633
So did l.

20
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,658
You? Come on.

21
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:44,964
No, it's true.

22
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,335
lt wasn't until l got
to the Cardassian front

23
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:49,704
l found out l had talents
l never knew l had.

24
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:50,765
At the front?

25
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,606
lt was a matter of figuring out

26
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:56,102
how to get a field transporter
operational in ten minutes

27
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:58,912
or wind up being
a Cardassian prisoner of war.

28
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,784
Now, l didn't know a transporter
from a turbolift in those days

29
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:05,153
but somehow,
in nine minutes, 53 seconds

30
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:07,748
l got that thing to work.

31
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:11,058
l got 13 men safely
off the surface of Setlik lll.

32
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:12,154
Next thing l know

33
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,062
l'm the tactical officer
on the <i>Rutledge.</i>

34
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:16,090
That's how l got the gold suit.

35
00:01:16,134 --> 00:01:18,762
Well, Jake is ready
for a new suit, too.

36
00:01:18,804 --> 00:01:21,796
The boy seems to grow
a centimeter each week.

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,604
You know, he struck me out
with a curve ball the other day.

38
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:25,701
First time.

39
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:29,009
They grow up in a hurry,
don't they, sir?

40
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,514
That they do.

41
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:34,544
l think l've got one.

42
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:36,850
Computer, set a new heading.

43
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,913
41 mark 301.

44
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:41,187
Confirmed.

45
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:43,158
lt's an M-Class, all right.

46
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:46,323
160 million kilometers
from Orellius Minor.

47
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:49,528
Should be a perfect place
to set up a colony.

48
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,298
Mm-hmm, but it looks like
someone's beaten us to it.

49
00:01:52,337 --> 00:01:53,998
You're reading life-forms?

50
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,472
Human life-forms.

51
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:57,907
l don't see anything
on the books

52
00:01:57,943 --> 00:02:00,776
about a colony
in the Orellius system.

53
00:02:00,812 --> 00:02:02,643
Trying all hailing frequencies.

54
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:05,081
Moving into synchronous orbit.

55
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:06,982
No response.

56
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:10,818
l'm picking up some kind of low-
level duonetic field down there.

57
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:13,256
lt may be blocking
communications.

58
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,089
Let's introduce ourselves
to our neighbors.

59
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,903
Yours, too?

60
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,500
Even the self-diagnostics
aren't working.

61
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:32,942
Just plain dead.

62
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,810
Sisko to <i>Rio Grande.</i>

63
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:37,610
Computer, respond.

64
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,182
l'd say there's no EM activity
at all around here.

65
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:44,415
Any idea why?

66
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,514
l'm not sure.

67
00:02:45,557 --> 00:02:47,024
But it might have
something to do

68
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:50,186
with that duonetic field
our sensors picked up.

69
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,387
Well, l hope you find

70
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,421
a few more of those talents
you never knew you had

71
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,955
because, if you don't,
we're going to have

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,092
a hard time getting off this...

73
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,624
Don't move!

74
00:02:58,904 --> 00:03:02,067
And put your hands up!

75
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:06,070
Turn around...

76
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:07,308
slowly.

77
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,219
They're from Starfleet.

78
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,488
That's right.

79
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,291
Mind if we put our hands down?

80
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,790
Well, the uniforms
have changed...

81
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:28,325
or have l just forgotten
what they look like?

82
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,530
My name is Joseph.

83
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:32,062
Vinod's the one playing
with the sharp object.

84
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:34,735
l'm Benjamin Sisko
and this is Miles O'Brien.

85
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:36,073
How did you get here?

86
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:38,011
We were going to ask you
the same thing.

87
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,877
We were surveying
for habitable planets

88
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:41,974
when our sensors picked
up your life signs.

89
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:43,951
There was no record
of a human colony here.

90
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,351
Well, our group was on its way
to settle on Gemulon V

91
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,355
over ten years ago

92
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,619
when our ship developed
life support problems

93
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:51,455
and we had to land here
for repairs.

94
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:53,552
Once we got here,
all our systems failed.

95
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:54,892
Nothing worked anymore.

96
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,056
So we've seen.

97
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:57,656
We've been stuck here
ever since.

98
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,826
And l guess you are, too, now.

99
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:00,857
We have a ship in orbit.

100
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,699
lt won't take our people
long to find us.

101
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,535
We'll be able
to get you all out of here.

102
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,973
Well, after ten years,
this is our home.

103
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:10,967
But you just said it yourself--
nothing works.

104
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,536
Well, we still do.

105
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,606
Well, come, we'll show you.

106
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:18,050
Vinod, run ahead
and tell your mother, uh...

107
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,280
we have guests.

108
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:21,644
Come.

109
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:38,564
Erewon-class
personnel transport.

110
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,438
Commissioned the <i>Santa Maria.</i>

111
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:42,670
Now we just call it ''the cabin.''

112
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:49,112
After all this time-- visitors!

113
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:52,484
Alixus, meet Ben and Miles.

114
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:55,649
Welcome to our community.

115
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,987
Miles.

116
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:58,117
Are there others?

117
00:06:58,193 --> 00:07:00,218
Just an empty runabout in orbit.

118
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:02,662
Hopefully, it will
attract some attention.

119
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:05,029
A runabout-- is that some kind
of new Starfleet vessel?

120
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:07,967
Yeah, they commissioned
the first ones two years ago.

121
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:09,868
They're a short-range
interstellar craft

122
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:12,999
about a quarter the size
of your ''cabin'' there.

123
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,066
l was the engineer
aboard the <i>Santa Maria.</i>

124
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,010
You and Miles will have a lot
to talk about, Joseph.

125
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:20,173
l'm sure all of us have
questions for our guests.

126
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:21,944
Who won the soccer matches
this year?

127
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,541
ls Golanga still playing?

128
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:25,382
No, he hurt his knee
four years ago.

129
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,081
They replaced it
with a bio-implant

130
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:28,918
but he wasn't
the same after that.

131
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:30,857
Who was it that won
last year, anyway?

132
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:31,950
l can never remember.

133
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,622
What are women's fashions like
back home now?

134
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,632
Oh, well...

135
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,793
Chief, you're the married one.

136
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,097
Oh, Keiko, my wife

137
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,434
she's been replicating
longer dresses lately.

138
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:45,599
Oh, no, that means

139
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,108
l'll have to alter
everything l own.

140
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,874
Well, that may just be
the Bajoran styles

141
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:54,541
she sees on Deep Space 9.

142
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,607
On Deep Space 9?

143
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,810
l'm sure Ben and Miles

144
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,412
will be happy to tell us
everything we want to know.

145
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:01,649
There will be plenty
of time for that later.

146
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,590
Actually, the first
thing l'd like to do

147
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,388
is try and get some response
from the EM systems.

148
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:09,022
We gave up any hope
of that years ago.

149
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:12,056
Yes, we noticed a low-level
duonetic field in the area

150
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,600
before we transported down.

151
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:14,795
Yes, the same thing

152
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,929
appeared on our sensors
when we were landing.

153
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:19,668
Our engines failed almost
the instant we hit the surface.

154
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,302
Without a functional tricorder

155
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:24,676
it was virtually impossible
to track down the source.

156
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,772
We do know that the
marshes all around us

157
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:29,079
are filled
with astatine deposits.

158
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:32,382
That's the only
explanation we have.

159
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,083
But we've done pretty well
without our tricorders

160
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:39,251
EM converters and com links,
haven't we?

161
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:42,752
After all, the human body
is a powerful tool.

162
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:47,564
We can plow the crops,
harvest the fields

163
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:48,728
construct the walls

164
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,898
that we need for protection
against the wilderness.

165
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,807
Weave the clothes that
we need to stay warm.

166
00:08:54,843 --> 00:08:56,902
ln a way, we've rediscovered

167
00:08:56,945 --> 00:09:00,108
what man is capable of
without technology.

168
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:02,048
lt hasn't been easy.

169
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:04,915
We've had some bitter winters

170
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:09,253
and... we've lost
some dear friends.

171
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:13,318
But we're very proud
of what we've accomplished here.

172
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:15,056
You have every right to be.

173
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,790
Are we all going to leave

174
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:18,696
when the others come
to rescue them?

175
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,930
That's something each of us

176
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:25,496
is going to have
to think about, isn't it?

177
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,880
Are you going to leave, Alixus?

178
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,743
Speaking for myself, no.

179
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,651
No, l'll never leave.

180
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:44,182
And l'll never want what we have
in our community to change.

181
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:46,090
lt means too much to me.

182
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:47,890
But while you are here

183
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:52,423
you are welcome to everything
our community has to offer.

184
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,402
The only thing we ask
is that you contribute.

185
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:57,098
We all work for our supper.

186
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:58,264
You'd be surprised

187
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,740
how much sweeter it tastes
when you do.

188
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:02,902
We'll be happy to do our part.

189
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:06,539
Joseph, would you find them
some bunks, please?

190
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:16,385
Two more strong,
healthy men, Vinod.

191
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:20,690
That could mean an awful lot
to this community.

192
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,275
Do you know an Admiral Mitsuya?

193
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,768
Best poker player in the fleet,
next to me.

194
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:40,474
Well, he's diverting
the <i>Crockett</i>

195
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,006
to stop at DS9
day after tomorrow

196
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:45,611
to talk about Cardassian
foreign policy?

197
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:48,589
That's just an excuse
to get Benjamin in a game.

198
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:50,784
Mitsuya cleaned him out
last year.

199
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,725
We better hail the <i>Rio Grande</i>

200
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:54,922
and get them
headed back this way.

201
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:57,864
l've worked two lifetimes
on Benjamin's poker.

202
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,730
He just can't learn
how to bluff.

203
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:01,258
That's odd.

204
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:03,566
l know, you'd think
a man like Benjamin...

205
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:06,039
No, the <i>Rio Grande...</i>

206
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:09,874
it's not responding
to our hails.

207
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:11,105
Commander?

208
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,476
Oh, come in, Chief.

209
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:14,914
l was just reading
one of the books

210
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:16,416
our host has written.

211
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:18,749
Alixus is quite
a prolific author.

212
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:22,086
Yeah, a bunch of these
were left in my room, too.

213
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:24,785
l haven't had a chance
to look at them.

214
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:26,657
What does she write about?

215
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:30,631
She seems to have something
to say on just about everything.

216
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:31,825
Yeah?

217
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:34,630
Economic analysis,
political commentaries

218
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:35,966
literary critiques.

219
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:39,940
She says she's spent her life
examining the human condition.

220
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:41,134
And what's her prognosis?

221
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,470
Not very good.

222
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,445
She says we have become
fat and lazy and dull.

223
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,110
My wife told me something along
those lines just last week.

224
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,156
''The common conceit that
the human species has evolved

225
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:58,124
''over the last several
centuries is ludicrous.

226
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,717
''What gains we have made

227
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,992
''have come at the cost
of our own core identities.

228
00:12:03,031 --> 00:12:05,625
Man has lost touch
with his true power.''

229
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,366
Sounds like it took
a crash landing

230
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:13,706
for her to find her paradise.

231
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,505
Have you found anything
in their ship

232
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:21,536
that can help us restore
contact with the runabout?

233
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,571
There's nothing to find.

234
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:26,585
Wave guides,
conduits, baffle plates--

235
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:28,450
you name it, it's gone.

236
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:29,579
The ship looks like

237
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:31,715
it's been through
a Ferengi junkyard.

238
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:33,088
What happened to it all?

239
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,422
We threw it away.

240
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,360
Well, since,
uh, none of it worked

241
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:39,762
to us, it was merely useless
junk taking up space.

242
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,596
Alixus felt its presence

243
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:44,967
was a constant reminder
of who you used to be.

244
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:47,495
Well, we all had to abandon
our dependence upon technology.

245
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,132
Removing every trace of it--

246
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,403
well, that made
the transition easier.

247
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:53,536
As an engineer,
you must have had

248
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,206
some problems with that.

249
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:58,807
Well, l was the last convert.

250
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:02,014
But, as time passed,
l realized Alixus was right.

251
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:03,851
She was helping us discover

252
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:06,016
a new philosophy of life
together

253
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:10,290
because we needed one
to survive.

254
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:14,694
And l'll tell you, every one
of us is better for it.

255
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,633
We are more committed
to each other.

256
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,899
We are truly a part
of each other's lives.

257
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:21,600
We've renewed a sense
of community

258
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,404
that man left behind
centuries ago.

259
00:13:24,443 --> 00:13:27,901
Joseph, Meg's fever
is getting worse.

260
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:40,124
The new herb doesn't seem
to be helping at all.

261
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,124
May l see?

262
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:42,421
Please.

263
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:45,862
We have an insect here
that transmits a disease

264
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:47,889
we haven't found a cure for.

265
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:50,128
We've lost three to it already.

266
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:51,897
Have you found
anything in the forest

267
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:53,097
like the sleeper fungi?

268
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:55,629
We've searched everywhere
for the right fungus or root

269
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:57,232
that would draw out
the infection.

270
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:58,368
lf it keeps spreading

271
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,345
she'll die
before the rescue team finds us.

272
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,779
The medical kit in the runabout

273
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,476
could probably
take care of this in a second.

274
00:14:04,516 --> 00:14:05,676
We have got to find a way

275
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:07,686
to restore the com link
to the transporter.

276
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,984
That would only be
a waste of time.

277
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:12,855
This duonetic field
inhibits energy flow

278
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:16,089
but a duonetic field
is a form of energy, too.

279
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:18,959
Maybe we could modify
our communicators

280
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:20,898
to run on the field itself.

281
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,230
Do you really think you could?

282
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:23,132
No!

283
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,330
lf you want to put
your efforts to good use

284
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:30,103
search the forest
for something else we might use.

285
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:31,369
This is primitive medicine.

286
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,900
You can't expect to save her...

287
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:36,381
Ben! May l see you
outside, please?

288
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,351
Talk like that isn't
constructive.

289
00:14:40,386 --> 00:14:42,251
l'm talking
about saving the life

290
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:43,687
of one of your followers.

291
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:45,417
You don't understand this yet.

292
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:46,481
No one follows me.

293
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,117
They follow their own hearts.

294
00:14:48,193 --> 00:14:50,991
My heart tells me to try
to get back to my ship.

295
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,122
l'm sure it does

296
00:14:52,197 --> 00:14:54,722
but if we'd had that attitude
for the last ten years

297
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:56,132
we wouldn't have been doing

298
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:58,066
what was necessary
to survive here.

299
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:01,834
To find the plants, herbs, molds
that cure disease.

300
00:15:01,874 --> 00:15:05,207
We've conquered 17 illnesses

301
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:08,077
with the most powerful resource
man has--

302
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:09,341
his ingenuity.

303
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:10,871
An interesting philosophy.

304
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,282
And while we're debating
it, a woman is dying.

305
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:15,753
We're doing everything
we can for her.

306
00:15:15,788 --> 00:15:16,880
No, we're not.

307
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:18,617
l won't have you disrupting

308
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:21,626
everything this community
has worked for, Ben.

309
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,390
l don't intend to stay here
any longer than necessary.

310
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,727
And that's another thing.

311
00:15:25,764 --> 00:15:28,892
Let's not bring up the Starfleet
rescue party again.

312
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:31,095
Until they come-- if they come--

313
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:33,832
you'll have to do things
our way.

314
00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:40,038
l'd strongly advise
you get rid of that uniform.

315
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,175
By mid-afternoon,
it gets hot in the fields.

316
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:03,196
The <i>Rio Grande's</i> been spotted.

317
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:04,327
Where?

318
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,634
Details are coming in
from Starfleet.

319
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:08,196
The Romulan vessel <i>Gasko</i>

320
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,606
reported seeing
an abandoned runabout.

321
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:14,669
Markings NCC-72452.

322
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:16,806
That's our ship, all right.

323
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:20,080
Traveling at warp 2
through sector 401.

324
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:22,585
At warp, with no one on board?

325
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:24,714
Command wants to know
if we can send someone

326
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:25,724
to investigate.

327
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:27,419
Signal them affirmative.

328
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:31,195
l already have.

329
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,221
Runabout Pad C.

330
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:37,633
You've got a real
talent for this, Ben.

331
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:39,967
Well, my father was a chef.

332
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:42,667
He grew all his own vegetables.

333
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:47,736
My brothers and l were sent out
to the gardens every day.

334
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,838
Most of the others--

335
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,508
they'd only eaten
replicated food

336
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:51,607
before they got here.

337
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,345
The flavor of the foods
we prepare

338
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:54,852
was quite a surprise to them.

339
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:56,684
But not you?

340
00:16:56,722 --> 00:17:00,214
My mother would never
let me eat replicated food.

341
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:04,857
What?

342
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:08,060
l can't help thinking
what my wife would say

343
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,032
if she saw me doing this.

344
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,366
Why?

345
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:14,497
Well, around my house, l'm
known as ''the black thumb.''

346
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,770
l'm just one
of those people, you know.

347
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:19,073
The only way l could get
anything to grow

348
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:20,577
was to marry a botanist.

349
00:17:20,612 --> 00:17:21,943
Oh, a botanist, really?

350
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,072
Yeah.

351
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:24,445
You should have seen
the arboretum

352
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:25,541
she grew on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

353
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:28,485
That's where l asked her
to marry me.

354
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,283
Oh, she'd love it here.

355
00:17:30,322 --> 00:17:32,790
Maybe you'll bring her someday.

356
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:34,315
Trouble is,
she wouldn't want to leave.

357
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,986
That's okay, too.

358
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:44,895
Come on.

359
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:47,428
Reach in.

360
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:48,440
Get my hand.

361
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:49,441
Here we go.

362
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:50,442
Good.

363
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:51,465
Easy now.

364
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,710
Get him into the shade.

365
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:16,196
All right, sit him down there.

366
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:17,463
Easy, easy.

367
00:18:17,503 --> 00:18:19,869
All right, here.
All right, here.

368
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:22,066
Here, Stephan,
if you chew these

369
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:24,735
they will help you
regain your strength.

370
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:26,505
What did he do to deserve this?

371
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:28,240
He stole a candle.

372
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,907
One candle?

373
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:31,074
How long was he in there?

374
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:33,048
Since yesterday.

375
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:35,781
ln that hell box?

376
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:38,483
ls this part of your philosophy
of life, too?

377
00:18:38,524 --> 00:18:40,082
You're a Starfleet Commander.

378
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,922
l'm sure
you've had to discipline

379
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,086
members of your crew.

380
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:44,459
Discipline is one thing.

381
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:45,554
Torture is another.

382
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:48,327
The first thing
this community accepted

383
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,597
was the need to establish
rules of conduct.

384
00:18:50,636 --> 00:18:52,501
All of us, including Stephan

385
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:54,904
approved this form
of punishment as necessary

386
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,931
and fair.

387
00:18:56,975 --> 00:18:59,000
How are you, Stephan?

388
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,545
l'll be all right.

389
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:10,571
l'm sorry, Alixus,
that l let down the community.

390
00:19:10,704 --> 00:19:13,264
The matter is closed.

391
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:14,569
Go inside.

392
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:16,371
Get some rest now.

393
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,379
Thank you, Alixus.

394
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:20,710
Come on, easy.

395
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:23,216
Easy.

396
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,718
Stephan will never
steal another candle

397
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:29,018
and neither will anyone else
who saw him here today.

398
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:31,149
ln time, you'll understand

399
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:34,319
that this is a simple
and effective way

400
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:37,262
to maintain law and order
in our community.

401
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,270
l get the distinct impression

402
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:49,673
she expects us
to be here for a while.

403
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,407
lf there is a way to adapt the
energy in the duonetic field

404
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:55,438
to get us back to the runabout

405
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:57,416
l want you to find it, Chief.

406
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:58,941
Yes, sir.

407
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:15,795
ls there anything you need?

408
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,235
No, l don't think so.

409
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:26,073
l'm sorry, Alixus
doesn't believe in doors.

410
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:29,082
We all take it for granted now.

411
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:31,277
You'll get used to it.

412
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:34,754
Hopefully, l won't be here
long enough to get used to it.

413
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:36,847
You don't like it here, do you?

414
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,358
lt's not what l'm used to.

415
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:40,917
Alixus has reminded us all

416
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:43,486
that it wasn't easy
for us at first either.

417
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,725
She's told us
to be patient with you.

418
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,063
Has she?

419
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:50,867
Your muscles must be sore
from all the work today.

420
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:54,101
This is an oil extract
from the Xupta tree.

421
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,699
lt's wonderfully soothing.

422
00:20:56,744 --> 00:20:58,871
Thanks, l'll try some.

423
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:01,642
Would you like me
to massage you with it?

424
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:04,873
l don't think so.

425
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:06,215
Thanks anyway.

426
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:10,887
lt'll make you feel
a lot better.

427
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:14,189
Here, let me show you.

428
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:19,529
Did she send you here?

429
00:21:21,602 --> 00:21:25,368
Did she send you here
to make love to me?

430
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:36,182
Ben, come in.

431
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:41,347
l was just writing about you
and Miles in my journal.

432
00:21:41,388 --> 00:21:43,583
l understand
you're quite a chef.

433
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:48,326
That's the first core behavior

434
00:21:48,362 --> 00:21:50,728
l've seen from you
since you arrived.

435
00:21:50,764 --> 00:21:51,788
Core behavior.

436
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,424
Does that chapter come

437
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:56,061
before or after
sexual procurement?

438
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:58,367
l assume you're talking
about Cassandra?

439
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:00,396
Did you send her to my room?

440
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,634
Yes.

441
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:03,575
l think you're contemptible.

442
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,202
lnteresting.

443
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:07,770
Contemptible.

444
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:10,682
Try and see it
through our eyes

445
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:12,912
just for a moment, Ben.

446
00:22:12,953 --> 00:22:16,389
Cassandra came to me;
she was worried.

447
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:19,517
She sensed
that you weren't happy.

448
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,027
She was right about that.

449
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:23,529
She was concerned
that all you see here

450
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:24,997
is work and hardship

451
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:28,058
and she wanted you to share
in our joy as well.

452
00:22:28,101 --> 00:22:30,831
So you sent her to me to win
my devotion to your cause.

453
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:33,738
l suggested she might
make it easier for you

454
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:35,241
to become a member
of our community.

455
00:22:35,275 --> 00:22:37,334
The choice was hers.

456
00:22:37,377 --> 00:22:40,244
Cassandra really likes you, Ben.

457
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,644
lt's fortunate that all these
books of yours aren't on padds

458
00:22:47,688 --> 00:22:51,215
like the other materials
the colonists brought.

459
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:53,351
l used to print them myself.

460
00:22:53,393 --> 00:22:54,553
l'm not surprised.

461
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:56,961
Vinod tells me that you never
ate replicated food

462
00:22:56,997 --> 00:22:58,362
before you came here.

463
00:22:58,398 --> 00:23:03,131
l'm not sure
l see the connection.

464
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,037
lt's just that you
never had much use

465
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:07,973
for technology, did you?

466
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:11,034
lt's interesting how you
happened to crash on a planet

467
00:23:11,078 --> 00:23:13,569
that fit your philosophy
of life so well.

468
00:23:13,614 --> 00:23:14,808
l agree.

469
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:17,248
ln fact, l've started
writing a book

470
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:18,774
about our experiences.

471
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:20,047
l've been wondering

472
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,486
if, in the ancient
religions of man

473
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:24,513
there aren't some new
truths to be found--

474
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:26,321
something to explain

475
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,798
how sometimes fate delivers us
exactly where we need to be.

476
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:34,858
Perhaps one day,
you'll even feel

477
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:38,030
the hand of God
on your shoulder.

478
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:40,835
You won't give a millimeter,
will you?

479
00:23:40,874 --> 00:23:43,342
Look at you,
still in your uniform

480
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:46,369
wanting so badly to get
back to your station

481
00:23:46,413 --> 00:23:49,940
with its artificial gravity
and its sterilized air.

482
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:56,317
You are so disconnected
from your core identity, Ben.

483
00:23:56,356 --> 00:23:59,621
There is a better way.

484
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,061
How can we help you see it?

485
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:09,035
Perhaps good hard
work is the answer.

486
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:10,764
Vinod.

487
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:12,669
Yes, Mother?

488
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:15,174
Ben will be standing
watch tonight.

489
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:40,627
Are you all right, Commander?

490
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:43,158
l'm a little tired,
but l'll be fine.

491
00:24:43,203 --> 00:24:44,465
Any luck on your end?

492
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:47,405
This duonetic field
is still a mystery, sir.

493
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:49,306
l can't believe
it's being generated

494
00:24:49,343 --> 00:24:51,641
by the astatine deposits
in the stream bed.

495
00:24:51,678 --> 00:24:52,736
Good morning, Ben.

496
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:53,803
Ready for some breakfast?

497
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:55,007
We have some lovely fruit.

498
00:24:55,048 --> 00:24:57,175
Try this.

499
00:24:57,217 --> 00:24:58,411
We found it growing

500
00:24:58,452 --> 00:25:00,750
along the riverbank
a few years ago.

501
00:25:00,787 --> 00:25:02,379
lt's some kind of native pear.

502
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:05,550
Oh, Ben, will you be able
to work your regular shift

503
00:25:05,592 --> 00:25:06,889
in the field today?

504
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:08,554
What are you talking about?

505
00:25:08,595 --> 00:25:11,496
You just had him up all night,
standing watch.

506
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:14,022
Of course, if you'd like
to be relieved of your duties

507
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:15,625
all you have to do is ask.

508
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:17,466
l'll work my shift.

509
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:22,203
Good. We're so shorthanded
out there.

510
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:24,870
But you really should
do yourself a favor

511
00:25:24,911 --> 00:25:27,880
and change into some
more comfortable clothes.

512
00:25:27,914 --> 00:25:30,144
Oh, by the way, you'll
be pleased to know

513
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:32,617
Meg seems better this morning.

514
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:34,677
Joseph is very optimistic

515
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:38,350
about a new combination
of herbs he's trying.

516
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:53,869
We're picking up a ship ahead.

517
00:25:53,907 --> 00:25:57,070
lt's the <i>Rio Grande,</i>
moving at warp 1.3.

518
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,941
Plotting an intercept course.

519
00:25:58,979 --> 00:26:00,913
Once we're abeam,
match our speeds exactly

520
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:02,005
and l'll transport over.

521
00:26:02,115 --> 00:26:03,173
Like hell you will.

522
00:26:03,216 --> 00:26:04,706
Sorry,
l'm the ranking officer here.

523
00:26:04,751 --> 00:26:08,414
At warp, l wouldn't be
in such a hurry to volunteer.

524
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:10,516
You got a better idea?

525
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:12,378
l'm the science officer.

526
00:26:12,418 --> 00:26:15,080
lt's my job
to have a better idea.

527
00:26:19,158 --> 00:26:20,750
What are you doing?

528
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:24,024
l'm trying an old rope trick
l learned on Earth once.

529
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:25,792
A rope trick?

530
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:27,389
A very talented Hopi l knew

531
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:30,027
did things with a rope
you wouldn't believe.

532
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:32,899
lt's an Old West American
art form.

533
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:37,341
You're suggesting we try to rope
the <i>Rio Grande</i> at warp.

534
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:38,809
With a tractor beam.

535
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:42,644
Once we pull it back to impulse,
isn't there a risk

536
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:45,809
that the strain
will rip both hulls apart?

537
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:48,012
lf the ship assembly teams
back at the yards

538
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:50,681
did their jobs really well,
we'll probably make it.

539
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:53,692
lf they had an off day,
we're going to have a problem

540
00:26:53,726 --> 00:26:55,250
but it's our best shot.

541
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:58,786
Unless as a ranking officer,
you have a better idea.

542
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:07,900
We're within tractor range.

543
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:11,401
Locking on.

544
00:27:17,116 --> 00:27:19,607
Engaging impulse engines.

545
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:50,147
Remind me to send
a thank-you note

546
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:51,843
to the assembly teams.

547
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:55,042
All stop.

548
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,816
Computer, ready transporter.

549
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:09,600
Meg has died.

550
00:28:09,635 --> 00:28:13,264
Suddenly, quietly.

551
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:18,004
No one was prouder
of what we've accomplished here

552
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,010
than Meg was.

553
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:23,809
Her dedication
to this community

554
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:26,750
and to us, was an inspiration

555
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:32,621
which is why l find myself
so troubled today by an act

556
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:37,288
that, by its very nature,
defiles her memory.

557
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,921
Vinod.

558
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:47,028
All of us have welcomed
our new arrivals with open arms

559
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:49,903
but they continue to reject us.

560
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:51,967
Despite their agreement

561
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,343
to respect
our fundamental way of life

562
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,644
this man has committed
the worst offense

563
00:28:57,683 --> 00:29:00,243
that can be committed
against this community.

564
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:04,722
He has selfishly
wasted precious time

565
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:08,124
that could have been
put to productive use.

566
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,718
Miles was discovered

567
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:13,220
trying to activate
his technological devices

568
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:15,665
so he could return to his ship.

569
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:16,998
Alixus, l'm sure

570
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:19,265
he only wanted to get
to the medical equipment

571
00:29:19,304 --> 00:29:20,931
which might have saved
Meg's life.

572
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:23,203
Thank you, Joseph.

573
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:25,437
l knew you would feel that way

574
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:29,345
and l'm glad you said it,
so that all of us could see

575
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:32,441
the true danger
these two represent.

576
00:29:32,484 --> 00:29:34,884
Our very own Joseph

577
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,252
defending
what he knows is wrong.

578
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:40,156
He knows that if we
had spent our energy

579
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:42,956
all these years,
trying to escape

580
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:45,020
we'd all be dead today.

581
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,757
This is good.

582
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,926
This is a test
of our convictions

583
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:51,128
and we will survive.

584
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,205
You're not going
to put him in there.

585
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:57,572
No, Ben, l'm not.

586
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:00,601
You are his commanding officer.

587
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:04,047
l hold you responsible
for his actions.

588
00:30:04,116 --> 00:30:06,243
l'm putting you in there.

589
00:30:06,285 --> 00:30:07,684
Wait a minute.

590
00:31:22,628 --> 00:31:23,595
No signs of resistance.

591
00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:25,494
None of the on-board weapons
has been fired.

592
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,724
But the logs have been erased.

593
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:28,130
Someone else
must have been here.

594
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:31,466
Maybe Sisko and
O'Brien beamed off

595
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:33,027
before the ship was boarded.

596
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:36,234
But then why would somebody
send the runabout off at warp?

597
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:38,800
Why wouldn't they just
keep it or destroy it?

598
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:40,334
l think they were
trying to destroy it.

599
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:41,676
How can you tell?

600
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:43,874
The hull's been exposed
to high temperatures

601
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,315
and intense gamma radiation.

602
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,319
lf we retrace the
<i>Rio Grande's</i> course

603
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:50,412
it takes us right back to...

604
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:52,013
An F-type star.

605
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:53,081
Orellius Minor.

606
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:55,421
There's only one way

607
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,553
the ship could be coming
straight from Orellius Minor

608
00:31:57,596 --> 00:31:59,427
and that's if someone
tried to destroy the ship

609
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:00,556
by flying it into the star.

610
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,657
And missed.

611
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,725
lf the trajectory
were slightly off

612
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:06,567
the star's gravity flux
would have deflected it

613
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:07,799
in a new direction.

614
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:11,603
Computer, send a tractor beam
to the <i>Orinoco.</i>

615
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:12,905
Prepare for a warp tow.

616
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:14,037
With a little luck

617
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,808
we'll be able to find
the warp signature

618
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:18,338
the engines left
when they were fired up.

619
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,351
Tractor beam in place.

620
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:23,411
Course laid in
for the Orellius system.

621
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:25,218
Engaging warp engines.

622
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:44,606
Please.

623
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:56,052
This is painful for me, too.

624
00:32:56,088 --> 00:32:58,249
l want so much to give you water

625
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,224
to let you lie down

626
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:03,884
to sleep, but l can't.

627
00:33:04,017 --> 00:33:06,247
Not without your help.

628
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:10,519
l know it's too difficult
to speak right now.

629
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:13,424
Just rest.

630
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,463
Change doesn't come
easy to you, Ben.

631
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:24,868
l realize it.

632
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:27,897
Believe me, l'm not expecting

633
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:30,034
some sudden,
miraculous conversion.

634
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,204
Change will come by itself,
if you're open to it.

635
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:37,410
But you do have to show us
that you're open to it.

636
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:41,353
A good start would be
to get rid of the uniform.

637
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:51,028
l'll leave you these clothes.

638
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:56,730
Once you've changed,
you can have this water.

639
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,514
Join us, Ben.

640
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,930
Miles.

641
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,247
What are you doing here?

642
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,640
l need your help, Joseph.

643
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:53,312
With what?

644
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:00,318
There's nothing l can do,
so please, don't ask me.

645
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,884
l've got to try to track down

646
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:04,294
where that duonetic field
is coming from.

647
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:08,097
We told you, there
are astatine deposits.

648
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:09,602
That's not what's causing it.

649
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:11,900
lf it were, l'd have
that transmitter running

650
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:13,769
and we'd all be out of here
already.

651
00:36:13,807 --> 00:36:15,331
lt's got to be something else.

652
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:18,367
And l think l figured a way
to get me to the source of it.

653
00:36:20,213 --> 00:36:23,740
And you want me to look the
other way while you leave.

654
00:36:23,783 --> 00:36:26,445
She'd put you in the box,
wouldn't she?

655
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:30,286
Then do me a favor.

656
00:36:30,323 --> 00:36:34,123
Look down at that hematite
deposit l just discovered.

657
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:36,129
Miles...

658
00:36:36,163 --> 00:36:38,723
l can do it
so it won't hurt at all.

659
00:37:01,454 --> 00:37:04,048
l owe you one, my friend.

660
00:39:09,149 --> 00:39:13,108
Well, you finally got one of us
out of our uniform.

661
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:17,146
Come on, move it.

662
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,589
Where's Alixus?

663
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,217
Get her out here.

664
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:31,495
Get him some water!

665
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:46,718
Do you know why this phaser
is working now?

666
00:39:46,753 --> 00:39:48,880
Because l shut down
the duonetic field

667
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:50,856
that was stopping it
from working.

668
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,757
An artificially created
duonetic field.

669
00:39:53,793 --> 00:39:57,661
Sisko to <i>Rio Grande.</i>

670
00:39:57,697 --> 00:40:01,956
Computer, respond.

671
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:04,887
Your ship is no longer
in orbit, Ben.

672
00:40:04,925 --> 00:40:07,450
l destroyed it.

673
00:40:07,495 --> 00:40:13,161
l assume that means you control
the duonetic field.

674
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,497
l helped invent it.

675
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:17,129
You'd be surprised
how many scientists

676
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:20,163
are sympathetic
to my philosophies.

677
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:21,674
Then it was no accident

678
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:25,008
we developed life-support
problems near this planet.

679
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,775
No, we were always
on our way here, Joseph.

680
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:30,010
l chose it months in advance.

681
00:40:30,051 --> 00:40:32,815
lt was far away
from any trade route

682
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:34,912
completely isolated.

683
00:40:34,955 --> 00:40:38,948
lt was perfect for our...
ideal community.

684
00:40:38,993 --> 00:40:44,021
l hoped when we landed
we would never leave here.

685
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:45,723
You lied to us.

686
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:49,759
You've been lying to us
for ten years.

687
00:40:49,804 --> 00:40:54,400
Yes, but perhaps a lie can lead
to a more important truth.

688
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:59,436
Would any of you have learned
who you really are at the core

689
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,607
if you hadn't have come here?

690
00:41:01,649 --> 00:41:04,846
Joseph, you would
have been a repairman

691
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:07,479
all of your life.

692
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:10,422
Cassandra, you would have
been a technical clerk

693
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:13,325
in some closed-in room.

694
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,090
And, Stephan, my friend

695
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,226
you probably would have
been in prison by now.

696
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:22,827
Look at yourselves!

697
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,670
Look at what you've become!

698
00:41:26,707 --> 00:41:35,581
What you've achieved here
has redefined your potential--

699
00:41:35,616 --> 00:41:39,108
the potential of man--

700
00:41:39,153 --> 00:41:42,418
just as l knew it would.

701
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:45,914
You are the living proof.

702
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,019
What of the dead?

703
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:52,959
What of Meg and the others?

704
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,769
Only my son knows
how l have suffered

705
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,571
as l watched each of them die.

706
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:05,909
You were willing to let them die
for your theories.

707
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:09,382
You're going to have to answer
for what you've done.

708
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:12,317
l'm prepared to go with you.

709
00:42:12,353 --> 00:42:15,186
Casualties were inevitable.

710
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:18,885
l had to accept that
from the start.

711
00:42:18,926 --> 00:42:22,327
What if it were your son
who had been sick?

712
00:42:22,363 --> 00:42:24,558
Would you let him die, too?

713
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:31,897
Yes.

714
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:36,569
For the sake of the community.

715
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:40,046
l did it all for the community.

716
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:46,744
Kira to Sisko.
Are you all right, Commander?

717
00:42:46,787 --> 00:42:52,419
Everything is...
under control, Major.

718
00:42:52,459 --> 00:42:55,553
Stand by to begin
multiple transports.

719
00:42:55,596 --> 00:42:57,587
Acknowledged.

720
00:42:57,631 --> 00:43:00,099
We have room for all of you
on the runabout.

721
00:43:02,169 --> 00:43:04,069
lf you have anything
you want to bring with you

722
00:43:04,104 --> 00:43:05,298
you ought to get it now.

723
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:08,206
Miles...

724
00:43:08,242 --> 00:43:12,338
this is our home.

725
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:16,315
Whatever Alixus may be guilty of

726
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:20,116
she did give us our community.

727
00:43:21,322 --> 00:43:23,381
l'm not sure if we'll
leave the device

728
00:43:23,424 --> 00:43:26,825
on or off, now that
we know it's there.

729
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,885
And we'll have to decide

730
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:33,628
if we want to establish contact
with the outside world.

731
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:37,569
But Alixus is right.

732
00:43:37,605 --> 00:43:43,100
We have found something here

733
00:43:43,143 --> 00:43:46,010
that none of us is willing
to give up.

734
00:43:46,113 --> 00:43:50,140
lt's time for those of us
who don't belong here

735
00:43:50,184 --> 00:43:52,277
to leave, Ben.

736
00:44:03,364 --> 00:44:05,855
Four to beam up, Major.

737
00:44:14,408 --> 00:44:16,672
Come, come.
