1
00:00:07,065 --> 00:00:09,090
Can't you ever just let go?

2
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,431
Let go?

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,460
The place is almost deserted.

4
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:15,166
There hasn't been a ship in
for three days

5
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:16,741
and yet you sit there

6
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:19,505
like a Baneriam hawk
looking for prey.

7
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:21,739
This is your chance to relax.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,179
l could set you up

9
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:25,183
with a terrific
holosuite program.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,309
Thank you,
but l don't accept gifts

11
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:28,683
from the likes of you.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,688
Who said anything about gifts?

13
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:32,656
You pay like everyone else.

14
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:34,682
l'm just trying to get
you into the tent.

15
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:36,421
l have no time for fantasies.

16
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:37,951
No imagination, huh?

17
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,190
A waste of time.

18
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:41,596
Too many people dream
of places they'll never go

19
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,863
wish for things
they'll never have

20
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:45,767
instead of paying
adequate attention

21
00:00:45,804 --> 00:00:47,203
to their real lives.

22
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:49,365
l could create

23
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,172
a shape-shifter playmate
for you.

24
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,306
The two of you could,
uh... intermingle.

25
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,872
You're disgusting.

26
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,817
lt's a living.

27
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,120
You're not allowing
young Mr. Sisko

28
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,990
in your holosuites, l hope.

29
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,494
lt's not what you think.

30
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,826
lt better not be.

31
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,831
You see that thing on his hand?

32
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,060
lt's a baseball mitten.

33
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:19,036
Every afternoon,
the boy goes up to play.

34
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:22,097
His father brought a program
with famous players.

35
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,165
You ever hear of Tris Speaker

36
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:27,678
or Ted Williams or Buck Bokai?

37
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,010
Afraid not.

38
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,344
Neither did l

39
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,112
until l made it my business
to find out.

40
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:35,779
With all these humans coming now

41
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:37,846
the true entrepreneur

42
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,518
knows how to...
sniff the wind.

43
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,959
Try it.

44
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:44,120
Go ahead.

45
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:46,528
l have no sense of smell.

46
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:49,659
You don't need one
to detect the scent

47
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:52,192
of op-por-tunity.

48
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,535
Opportunity.

49
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,508
Family entertainment.

50
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:59,203
That's the future, Odo.

51
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,178
There's a fortune to be made.

52
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:03,647
Little holocreatures
running around.

53
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:05,912
Rides and games for the kiddies.

54
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:08,146
Ferengis standing
in every doorway

55
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,688
selling... useless souvenirs.

56
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:14,681
You're going to replace
all your sexual holoprograms

57
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:16,455
with family entertainment?

58
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:17,484
No, no.

59
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:19,156
No. l'm expanding.

60
00:02:19,197 --> 00:02:21,927
l'm negotiating
to lease the space next door

61
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,265
so l can use
the same hologenerators.

62
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:26,167
Well, you're still disgusting.

63
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:28,638
Till the day l die.

64
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,343
l'm sure you're exaggerating.

65
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:34,675
You are constantly
in my thoughts.

66
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:36,010
l can't even...

67
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:39,505
That was two <i>raktajinos,</i>
extra strong.

68
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:42,111
l can't even concentrate.

69
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:45,521
You seemed to be
concentrating just fine

70
00:02:45,557 --> 00:02:49,118
on the Junior Lieutenant
at the reception

71
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,822
for Captain Stadius.

72
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:54,389
She was a poor substitute
for you.

73
00:02:54,433 --> 00:03:00,065
And the Betazoid envoy
who was here last week.

74
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:03,563
A... barely...

75
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:06,577
adequate substitute for you.

76
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,980
Julian, you are
a wonderful friend.

77
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,912
l enjoy the time
we spend together.

78
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,444
Stop.

79
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,720
You're driving a stake
through my heart.

80
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:27,665
Try a high-pitched sonic shower.

81
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,530
lt will make you feel better.

82
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:32,162
No, it won't.

83
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:34,536
l've already tried it.

84
00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:45,513
Sorry l'm late.

85
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,677
l was having dinner with Julian.

86
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,584
How is our young doctor?

87
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:51,282
Young.

88
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:52,813
Anything going on?

89
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,656
We were just looking
at an unusual energy reading.

90
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:00,096
Elevated thoron emissions
in the plasma field.

91
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,395
We thought it might be
an environmental byproduct

92
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,629
created by the increased
traffic in this area.

93
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:05,966
lt could be.

94
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,632
Ships have always avoided
the Denorios Belt.

95
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:10,698
And we have no idea
how the presence

96
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:12,903
of so many warp
and impulse engines

97
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:13,968
might affect it.

98
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:15,138
The question is--

99
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,648
is this going
to cause us any problems?

100
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:20,981
We were hoping
you could tell us.

101
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:25,979
''...and the messenger
from the queen

102
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:29,482
''watched the little man as he
danced and sang and laughed.

103
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:32,895
''How he would soon have
the daughter he always wanted

104
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:36,298
because they would never guess
that his name was...?''

105
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,097
Rumpelstiltskin.

106
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:39,763
''Rumpelstiltskin.''

107
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:41,294
Right.

108
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:42,829
''And the next day

109
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:44,739
''when the little man
came and asked

110
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:49,145
'''Now, Mrs. Queen,
what is my name?'

111
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,948
''She said, at first, 'Well,
are you called, um... Jack?'

112
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:57,011
'''No,' he answered.

113
00:04:57,055 --> 00:05:00,183
'''Are you called Harry?'

114
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:03,022
'''No,' he answered.

115
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:06,462
''And then she said,
'Then perhaps

116
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:07,897
'your name is...?'''

117
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,127
Rumpelstiltskin!

118
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,600
'''Rumpelstiltskin.'

119
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:13,468
''And, at the sound
of his own name

120
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:15,769
''the old man was so furious

121
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:19,709
''that he stamped his foot,
shaking the entire kingdom

122
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:23,043
''and he broke in two
and disappeared

123
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:26,016
''and the king and the queen
and their daughter

124
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:29,487
lived happily ever after.''

125
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:30,988
Good night, little one.

126
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:34,822
Sweet dreams.

127
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:36,451
l'm not tired.

128
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:37,756
Ah, ah, ah.

129
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,127
None of that.

130
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,361
Good night, sweetheart.

131
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:55,411
Now, then, shall l tuck you in
with a bedtime story, too?

132
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:57,915
Mmm! Only if you're
tucked in with me.

133
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,678
Mmm. Naturally.

134
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,482
Mommy?

135
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:06,990
What is it, honey?

136
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,686
He's in my room.

137
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:10,752
Who?

138
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:12,763
Rumpelstiltskin.

139
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:16,898
Sweetheart...

140
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:19,495
that was just make-believe.

141
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:23,132
Rumpelstiltskin
isn't real, okay?

142
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,732
All right.

143
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:28,075
l'll come in and check,
but then it's bedtime.

144
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,978
Why do we tell her stories

145
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,678
about evil dwarfs
that want to steal children?

146
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,555
Well, don't look so distraught.

147
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:43,493
l'm only here
to offer you my services

148
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,088
if you should need them.

149
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,257
Take her out of here.

150
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,656
What's wrong?

151
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:54,755
Miles, what...?

152
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:56,286
Please, just go.

153
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:00,691
A pity you're sending
the ladies away.

154
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:04,330
lt's as if all the life
just went out of the room.

155
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:07,001
O'Brien to Security.

156
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,008
Go ahead.

157
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,031
lntruder alert.

158
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,577
Send a team to my quarters
immediately.

159
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:11,601
On our way, Chief.

160
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,655
So where's the straw?

161
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:28,059
l assume you want gold
spun from straw.

162
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:29,686
What are you?

163
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:32,393
Well, surely you must know.

164
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:35,027
You were just telling
the little one all about me.

165
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:39,005
l know what you look like,
but you're not...

166
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,439
Ah! Don't say it.

167
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:42,966
l don't like the sound of it,
you know.

168
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,638
Rumpelstiltskin.

169
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,748
Now, you didn't think

170
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:51,309
that would make me break in two
and disappear, did you?

171
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:52,979
Not this time.

172
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:55,717
l learned my lesson
back in the kingdom.

173
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:58,317
l don't make deals
like that anymore.

174
00:10:00,161 --> 00:10:02,095
Ah, the local constabularies.

175
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:05,098
Gents, show me
a small bit of courtesy

176
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:07,101
and l'll be very pleasant

177
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:10,103
but try and lay a hand on me
and you'll soon regret it.

178
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:13,537
Besides,
l'm much too fast for you.

179
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,237
And now, my good host

180
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:19,109
if gold is not your pleasure

181
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,240
tell me your needs
and l'll tell you my price.

182
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:24,114
O'Brien to Sisko.

183
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:25,482
Go ahead, Chief.

184
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,114
l need you in my quarters
on the double.

185
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:29,646
l'm on my way.

186
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,890
Dad, l've got to talk to you.

187
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,986
Now, Jake, l don't have time.
l'm...

188
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:39,399
Hello, Ben.

189
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:42,403
He followed me home
from the holosuite.

190
00:10:57,852 --> 00:11:00,082
Mmm...

191
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:12,890
Jadzia!

192
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:13,958
Hello, Julian.

193
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:15,628
What are you doing here?

194
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,637
Watching you.

195
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,434
Waiting for you to wake up.

196
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:19,770
l'm awake.

197
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:21,206
ls something wrong?

198
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:24,405
Funny, l was about
to ask you the same question.

199
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,208
lt... it...

200
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:30,047
must be this Larosian virus
that's been going around.

201
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:31,608
How do you feel?

202
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:33,244
Wonderful.

203
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,345
Um...

204
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:35,378
Mmm...

205
00:11:35,423 --> 00:11:37,118
No... no fever.

206
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:38,557
Uh... must be me.

207
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:40,823
Must be me.
Must be me.

208
00:11:40,862 --> 00:11:43,023
Uh... must be
an allergic reaction

209
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:46,124
to the replicated antipasto
l had at lunch.

210
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,394
Perhaps...

211
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,130
l must be hallucinating.

212
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:51,137
Why are you fighting this?

213
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:53,264
Why am l fighting this?

214
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:55,775
Why... am l fighting this?

215
00:11:58,146 --> 00:12:03,607
l have no good answer
to that question.

216
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:08,780
All senior officers
report to Ops immediately.

217
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:09,847
Okay.

218
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:11,654
l get it.

219
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:12,920
Very funny.

220
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,791
Did O'Brien put you up to this?

221
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,229
l don't know
what you're talking about.

222
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:18,892
''Senior officers to Ops.''

223
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:20,093
We all walk in

224
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:22,863
everybody has a good laugh
at my expense.

225
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:24,667
This is not a joke, Julian.

226
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:26,366
We'll see.

227
00:12:31,412 --> 00:12:32,640
Ah. Good.

228
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,843
lt seems we have
a small mystery on our hands.

229
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:38,044
Lieutenant Jadzia Dax
and Dr. Julian Bashir

230
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:39,746
l'd like you
to meet Harmon Bokai

231
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:42,551
a baseball player from the
London Kings who's been dead

232
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,114
for 200 years.

233
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:45,318
Don't look at me.

234
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,122
l can't figure it out either.

235
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:49,356
And a medieval
fairy tale character

236
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:50,796
named Rumpelstiltskin.

237
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:51,799
Oh, fine.

238
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,801
Now everyone knows my name.

239
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:57,032
Until today, he only
existed in storybooks.

240
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:58,971
A pleasure, l'm... l'm sure.

241
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:00,439
Could this be related

242
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,602
to the increased
thoron emissions

243
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:04,008
in the plasma field?

244
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,645
Thoron emissions?

245
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:10,981
l think you'd better ask me,
Benjamin.

246
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:31,068
l was hitting a few to the boy.

247
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:34,404
He's really been moving well
under the ball lately, Ben.

248
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:36,808
We would have worked
on some baserunning

249
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:39,244
except, uh... well,
he was getting hungry

250
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,747
and l realized l was, too.

251
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,408
A hologram with an appetite?

252
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,509
Hologram?

253
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:46,110
On the contrary, Major.

254
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,517
He's quite real.

255
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:49,682
They all seem to be.

256
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:51,316
What the hell
they talking about, Ben?

257
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:59,731
You.
You're not actually Buck Bokai.

258
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:02,327
So how come
l'm wearing his uniform?

259
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,066
You're a holographic image
of Buck Bokai that l created

260
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:07,006
so Jake and l could
play ball with you.

261
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,032
But l remember.

262
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:11,044
l remember all the games.

263
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:12,773
All the opening days.

264
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:15,941
The homer
that won the '42 World Series.

265
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,850
The squeaker that went
under Eddie Newson's glove.

266
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:21,855
The day l broke
DiMaggio's consecutive streak.

267
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,357
l programmed it
into the computer--

268
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:27,054
all of it-- every statistic.

269
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:29,961
What foreign tongue
are they speaking?

270
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:33,364
This one didn't come out
of any holosuite.

271
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,562
But he did come out
of your imagination

272
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:37,503
just as Buck came out of Jake's.

273
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:39,665
His imagination?

274
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:44,303
Then, l must have come out
of your imagination, Julian.

275
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:46,973
Uh... not necessarily.

276
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:48,743
Well...

277
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:49,977
maybe.

278
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:53,418
How could this sort of thing
possibly happen?

279
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:55,422
A subspace disruption.

280
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:58,425
Maybe some kind
of dimensional shift.

281
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:01,257
l didn't see an anomaly
when l scanned the plasma field

282
00:15:01,295 --> 00:15:04,162
but it could have been so small
the sensors missed it.

283
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:06,666
Julian, let's go
to your quarters.

284
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:09,033
Please.
l haven't got time for this.

285
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:13,273
Odo to Sisko.

286
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:14,433
Go ahead.

287
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:16,602
ls there something
you want to tell me?

288
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:18,202
l'm in no mood for games,
Constable.

289
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:19,542
What do you need?

290
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,071
Are the environmental controls
broken down?

291
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:23,912
lt's snowing on the Promenade.

292
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:25,077
Snowing?

293
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:27,347
We're looking at five
or six centimeters down here.

294
00:15:27,388 --> 00:15:29,219
Bring in
all available security, Odo.

295
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:31,053
We're going to Yellow Alert.

296
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:32,389
What's going on?

297
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,894
lt seems we're letting
our imaginations run wild.

298
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:37,762
As soon as l have an
explanation, l'll give you one.

299
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:39,095
Sisko out.

300
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,430
Yellow Alert?

301
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:42,026
Against our own imaginations?

302
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:44,037
You have a better idea?

303
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:47,802
l think l've got something.

304
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:50,811
Look at the wave patterns
of the plasma field.

305
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:53,109
The wave fronts are converging
toward a single point.

306
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,581
The particle density rises
as you get closer to the center

307
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:58,778
but then it looks like it
just drops off completely.

308
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,116
You're right.

309
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:02,684
l'm not getting any particulate
readings from the core.

310
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:04,148
What does that mean?

311
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:07,780
Whatever falls in there
is just gone.

312
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:09,050
You were right.

313
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:11,717
lt is some kind
of subspace disruption.

314
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,557
l want a full analysis.

315
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,756
Chief,
get a class-4 probe ready.

316
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:17,059
Aye, sir.

317
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:19,623
ls there anything
l can do to help?

318
00:16:22,537 --> 00:16:24,061
Odo to Ops.

319
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,867
Go ahead.

320
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:27,374
The snow's disappeared

321
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:31,640
but now there's a Gunji jackdaw
running loose around here.

322
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,307
Just try to keep things
under control, Odo.

323
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:35,782
We're working on it.

324
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:37,478
Understood.

325
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:41,948
Come along now.
Come along.

326
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,480
There we go.

327
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:00,804
Ladies and gentlemen

328
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:03,675
may l have your attention,
please?

329
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,739
Ladies and gentlemen

330
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:10,410
and all androgynous creatures

331
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:11,918
your attention, please.

332
00:17:11,953 --> 00:17:13,750
As you may have noticed

333
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:16,052
we're experiencing
some difficulties.

334
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:19,560
l'm going to have to ask you all
to please refrain

335
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:21,357
from using your imaginations.

336
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:23,830
Just because you
don't have an imagination

337
00:17:23,865 --> 00:17:28,928
don't ruin it
for the rest of us.

338
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,165
Let me guess.

339
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:35,609
Another clever Federation
experiment has gone awry

340
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:38,669
and you've turned
the whole station

341
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:40,874
into one vast holosuite.

342
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:44,749
The phenomenon is being
investigated as we speak.

343
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,276
Uh-huh.

344
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:49,347
Well, uh, tell them
to take their time.

345
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,757
l haven't had a chance
to show the ladies

346
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:55,991
my collection
of Tartaran landscapes yet.

347
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,261
l'm surprised
by your attitude, Quark.

348
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,699
Ah, yes.

349
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:04,762
Well, you simply don't have
the same appreciation for...

350
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:08,799
art as l do.

351
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:10,834
Dabo.

352
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:17,741
l'm surprised because every one
of your customers is winning.

353
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:18,911
What?

354
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:21,183
They're taking you
to the poorhouse.

355
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:23,053
Dabo. Another winner!

356
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:25,058
No.
No, that's not possible.

357
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:27,061
Let me through.

358
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:30,586
Lose. Lose...

359
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:33,192
One cross...

360
00:18:33,234 --> 00:18:34,861
Two cross.

361
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:40,231
No! No!

362
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:42,072
You're outnumbered, Quark.

363
00:18:42,143 --> 00:18:44,805
Pardon me.
Pardon me.

364
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:02,024
l was afraid of this.

365
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,566
The proximity of the wormhole
is amplifying the rupture.

366
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,864
The proton counts
are going through the roof.

367
00:19:07,902 --> 00:19:08,869
Dax to O'Brien.

368
00:19:08,903 --> 00:19:10,996
How are you coming
with that probe, Chief?

369
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,870
l'll have
the subspace scanners programmed

370
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:13,874
in less than an hour.

371
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:16,433
Keep me informed.
Dax out.

372
00:19:16,477 --> 00:19:18,809
l have the wave
intensity analysis.

373
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:21,675
Computer, scan all data files

374
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:23,707
for comparable wave
intensity patterns.

375
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:24,911
Stand by.

376
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,917
Jadzia...

377
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:33,052
l find this difficult to say

378
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:35,595
but l want you to know,
l would...

379
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,793
Julian, there's really
no need to apologize.

380
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,061
ln a way

381
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:42,466
l feel as if we've
invaded your privacy.

382
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:46,337
We all have fantasies and dreams
we keep to ourselves--

383
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:49,741
thoughts
that should remain private.

384
00:19:49,777 --> 00:19:51,244
l'm glad you understand.

385
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,042
Of course l do.

386
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:55,914
l was a young man... once.

387
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,010
So we can put
all this behind us?

388
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:00,520
Of course.

389
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:01,715
Good.

390
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:04,247
The computer seems
to be having trouble

391
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,589
finding a match.

392
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:08,094
She really is submissive,
isn't she?

393
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:10,097
ls that how you want
me to be, Julian?

394
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:11,758
So submissive?

395
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,790
l am not submissive.

396
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:15,063
Am l?

397
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:16,968
Uh, no.

398
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:19,803
Um, uh...
well, l don't think so.

399
00:20:19,841 --> 00:20:22,969
l'm just not the cold fish
you are.

400
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:26,037
Cold fish?

401
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,106
Now, l, uh, never said that.

402
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:32,311
lf you'd get down
off your high horse

403
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:34,753
you'd start
to appreciate Julian.

404
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:36,757
She has a sense of humor

405
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,554
as l've always imagined you do.

406
00:20:38,593 --> 00:20:40,993
l could use one about now.

407
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:42,121
Come on, Lieutenant.

408
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,596
Stop denying all those
yearnings you feel.

409
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:46,600
Yearnings?

410
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:47,965
lf you don't

411
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:50,334
you'll never know
what you missed.

412
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:51,838
Pattern match found.

413
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:53,670
Just in the nick of time.

414
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:57,809
A similar subspace rupture
was reported

415
00:20:57,845 --> 00:21:00,609
in the Hanoli system
in the mid-23rd century.

416
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:01,876
The Hanoli system.

417
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,349
l don't believe
l know where that is.

418
00:21:03,384 --> 00:21:05,352
There's no reason you should.

419
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:09,413
When the rupture expanded,
the system was destroyed.

420
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:23,602
Station Log, Stardate 46853.2.

421
00:21:23,638 --> 00:21:26,505
We have launched a probe
to study the subspace anomaly.

422
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,203
Meanwhile, more than half
the people aboard DS9

423
00:21:29,243 --> 00:21:32,406
have reported manifestations
of their imagined thoughts.

424
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:35,382
All probe systems
are reading normal.

425
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,249
Calibrating sensors
for subspace.

426
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:40,516
Three minutes to coordinates.

427
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:46,055
Wave patterns should begin
fluctuating any time now.

428
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:48,120
There.

429
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:51,255
The probe is penetrating
the thoron field.

430
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,097
Two and a half minutes
to coordinates.

431
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:57,503
Ah, for simpler times, eh?

432
00:21:57,538 --> 00:21:58,971
Go away.

433
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:00,940
l only want to help.

434
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,338
You're in the way.

435
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:11,611
A farmer from Derry
once tried to chase me off

436
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:15,213
until l saved his crops...
from locusts.

437
00:22:15,256 --> 00:22:17,724
Two minutes to coordinates.

438
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:20,283
Thoron emissions are stable.

439
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:23,525
You know what l find
most intriguing

440
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:25,725
about you, my good host?

441
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:27,256
You're afraid.

442
00:22:30,505 --> 00:22:32,905
Of me.

443
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,407
Look, figment

444
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:38,469
l'm not afraid of anybody,
least of all you.

445
00:22:38,513 --> 00:22:40,981
90 seconds to coordinates.

446
00:22:41,015 --> 00:22:42,380
Figment, am l?

447
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,852
A figment of my imagination,
that's all.

448
00:22:45,887 --> 00:22:48,447
And yet, you can't deny

449
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:51,390
how this imagination of yours
empowers me, can you?

450
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:53,825
Empowers me in a way

451
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:55,761
that somehow terrifies you.

452
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:59,129
You should be getting
some primary data, Commander.

453
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:01,701
They're coming in now, Chief.

454
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:02,794
Stand by.

455
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:06,830
She is your firstborn,
isn't she?

456
00:23:13,714 --> 00:23:16,308
30 seconds to coordinates.

457
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,905
Thoron emission
patterns unstable.

458
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:21,302
Probe hull temperature
dropping rapidly.

459
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:22,831
Ten seconds.

460
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:26,606
The probe's approaching
the perimeter of the anomaly.

461
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:27,874
That's strange.

462
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:29,006
What is it?

463
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:31,778
Negative readings
on all sensors.

464
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:35,777
We may be looking
at some sort of folded space.

465
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:37,619
Let's see
what the optical scanner

466
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:38,919
on the probe gives us.

467
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,729
lt's drawing in all the matter
from the surrounding space.

468
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:50,031
Benjamin, it's getting larger.

469
00:23:54,574 --> 00:23:56,701
Feel like taking
a few ground balls?

470
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:57,971
Look, l tried to tell you

471
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:00,571
you're on a space station
in the 24th century.

472
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:03,946
The only ball field around
is a holographic simulation.

473
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:05,883
lt's not real,
and neither are you.

474
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:07,886
Oh, you see, l don't get it.

475
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,150
l can pinch myself
and it hurts

476
00:24:10,189 --> 00:24:11,588
and l am here with you,
aren't l?

477
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:14,252
Right now you are,
but, in a minute, who knows?

478
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:16,488
l hope when we get this thing
figured out, you'll...

479
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:18,019
Disappear for good?

480
00:24:18,064 --> 00:24:19,031
l hope so.

481
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:20,224
Oh, you do, huh?

482
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:22,757
Well, so let's just say
for a moment l don't.

483
00:24:22,802 --> 00:24:24,235
So what am l supposed to do,
huh?

484
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,635
You got room on your team

485
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:27,662
for a switch-hitting
third baseman

486
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:28,674
with good power?

487
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,539
Good power from the left side.

488
00:24:30,576 --> 00:24:33,568
Left side?
Ben, hey.

489
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:34,841
Hey, Ben.

490
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:36,473
What are you talking about?

491
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,040
l hit over 20 homers
right-handed

492
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:40,244
in each of my first three years
in the majors.

493
00:24:40,286 --> 00:24:42,049
And never more
than ten after that.

494
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:44,851
That was because Old Crow
moved me to second in the order.

495
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:47,257
l wish l had more time for this.

496
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:51,696
Well, that was baseball's
epitaph, wasn't it?

497
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:54,564
Nobody seemed to have
time for us anymore.

498
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,727
You know, l could have
played five more years

499
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:58,703
if they hadn't killed the game.

500
00:24:58,738 --> 00:25:00,865
You were the best
that ever played.

501
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:01,874
l know.

502
00:25:01,908 --> 00:25:03,671
l've played with them all.

503
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:06,805
l've got work to do.

504
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:09,246
Hey, Ben.

505
00:25:09,282 --> 00:25:11,273
lt really meant a lot to me--

506
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:12,614
how much you cared.

507
00:25:12,652 --> 00:25:14,882
That day we won the World Series

508
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:17,719
there were only 300 people
in the stands.

509
00:25:17,757 --> 00:25:20,021
301 in my version.

510
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:22,458
l heard you cheering.

511
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:24,486
Meant a lot to me.

512
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,990
l just thought
you should know, you know

513
00:25:29,035 --> 00:25:32,562
in case l do finally disappear.

514
00:25:37,677 --> 00:25:38,939
Ops.

515
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,310
We don't know any more
than when we started.

516
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:50,845
Why would mine create
a woman and then reject her?

517
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,621
Why would mine create a dwarf
that could terrify him?

518
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,958
We should abandon
the whole thing.

519
00:25:56,996 --> 00:25:57,963
Not yet.

520
00:25:57,997 --> 00:26:00,830
l made a connection with mine.

521
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:01,993
A curious one.

522
00:26:02,034 --> 00:26:03,558
l sense a feeling from him--

523
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,230
an affection for this ballplayer

524
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:07,705
who died 200 years
before he was even born.

525
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,729
And how much longer

526
00:26:08,774 --> 00:26:10,765
do you suggest
we devote to this?

527
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,472
As long as it takes.

528
00:26:13,513 --> 00:26:17,472
lt ain't over till it's over.

529
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:28,253
Station Log, supplemental.

530
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:31,127
The subspace anomaly
continues to expand.

531
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:34,998
As of yet, we've been unable
to find a way to contain it.

532
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:36,194
As a precaution

533
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:38,362
we have diverted
all incoming ships

534
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:39,735
away from the station.

535
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:42,297
A Vulcan science mission
to the Hanoli rift

536
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:46,038
detonated a pulse wave torpedo
at the coordinates of the tear.

537
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:49,047
Five minutes after they did,
the rupture expanded radically.

538
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:50,274
They were wiped out

539
00:26:50,316 --> 00:26:52,443
along with the entire
Hanoli system.

540
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,919
What happened
to the rupture after that?

541
00:26:54,954 --> 00:26:56,182
lt's not still there?

542
00:26:56,222 --> 00:26:58,816
lt reached a critical mass point
and imploded

543
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:01,850
and then disappeared
from normal space altogether.

544
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:03,555
Were there any reports
from the Vulcans

545
00:27:03,596 --> 00:27:04,927
about hallucinations on board?

546
00:27:04,964 --> 00:27:07,558
Anything similar
to what we're experiencing?

547
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,727
No, sir, but they were
only within range

548
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:11,259
of the anomaly for 12 hours.

549
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:14,102
And Vulcans don't have
the most active imaginations.

550
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,937
Were there
any explanations offered

551
00:27:15,975 --> 00:27:18,205
for the initial cause
of the rupture?

552
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:19,506
Dozens, nothing confirmed.

553
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:21,376
But we do know
there were no wormholes

554
00:27:21,414 --> 00:27:23,211
and very little starship
activity

555
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:24,511
in the area before it formed.

556
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,144
We've looked high and low
for some common ground--

557
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:30,212
something to give us a fix
on how to attack this thing

558
00:27:30,256 --> 00:27:32,622
and frankly, sir,
as funny as it sounds

559
00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:35,593
we think pulse wave torpedoes
may still be the best approach.

560
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:36,890
Wait a minute.

561
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:38,829
lf it didn't work
very well last time, why...

562
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:41,196
The Vulcans were using
a primitive device.

563
00:27:41,234 --> 00:27:42,758
ln the past 200 years

564
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:45,930
we've developed far better ways
of controlling the flux density.

565
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:49,305
We should be able to contain
the internal reaction this time.

566
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:52,311
And if we can't, we destroy
the whole Bajoran system.

567
00:27:52,345 --> 00:27:54,245
Major, the rupture
is already expanding.

568
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,577
We have to seal it

569
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:58,049
or it's going to destroy
this system anyway.

570
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,880
The smaller it is,
the better chance we have.

571
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,548
How long will it take to create
one of these torpedoes?

572
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:06,080
We could have one ready
by 2200 hours.

573
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:08,685
lf the rift expands at all
before imploding

574
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,161
we have to be prepared.

575
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:12,164
Route auxiliary power
to shields.

576
00:28:12,198 --> 00:28:13,597
Major, l'd like for you

577
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,999
to coordinate evacuation
of the pylons.

578
00:28:16,102 --> 00:28:17,126
Odo can help you.

579
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:18,898
Dismissed.

580
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,534
Kira to Odo.

581
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,738
What is it, Major?

582
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:29,339
l need you to do a security
sweep through the pylons.

583
00:28:29,382 --> 00:28:30,747
We're going to evacuate them.

584
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:34,185
l'll get on it
as soon as possible.

585
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,710
l've got my hands full
right now.

586
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,722
Clear the way!

587
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,519
Get out of the corridor.
Let them through.

588
00:28:38,557 --> 00:28:39,854
Clear the way now!

589
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,498
Kira to Ops.

590
00:28:52,538 --> 00:28:54,301
Lower Pylon 1 is gone.

591
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,773
l need emergency...

592
00:29:04,216 --> 00:29:05,979
Sisko to Kira.
Report.

593
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:07,883
Kira, can you read me?

594
00:29:11,657 --> 00:29:14,353
Major Kira, report.

595
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,564
Disregard, Commander.

596
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:24,702
False alarm.

597
00:29:24,737 --> 00:29:26,398
Kira out.

598
00:29:45,257 --> 00:29:50,285
All personnel in Lower Pylon 1,
report to Outer Ring Airlock.

599
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:52,263
Prepare for evacuation.

600
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:55,023
Clear the way now.

601
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:56,032
Clear the way.

602
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:57,363
Please stay inside.

603
00:29:57,403 --> 00:29:58,370
This isn't a show.

604
00:29:58,404 --> 00:29:59,371
Odo!

605
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:00,372
You, get out of the way!

606
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:02,237
Odo! Odo!

607
00:30:02,274 --> 00:30:03,433
Odo!

608
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:04,430
Odo! Odo!

609
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:05,695
Thank goodness.

610
00:30:05,735 --> 00:30:07,464
l want to report
two missing persons--

611
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:08,664
a blonde and a brunette.

612
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:09,672
Can't you see l'm busy?

613
00:30:09,706 --> 00:30:10,900
Don't scare them.

614
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,137
One minute, they're whispering
sweet nothings in my ear.

615
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:16,509
The next minute,
the sweet nothings are gone.

616
00:30:16,546 --> 00:30:18,411
Will you get off
the street, before...

617
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:22,748
Girls!

618
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:26,812
l've been looking
everywhere for you.

619
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:30,223
Don't ever do that to me again.

620
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,490
So, Odo, what have you

621
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:35,862
conjured up
during all this, hmm?

622
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:37,764
Me?

623
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,859
l should have guessed--
nothing at all.

624
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:42,133
l've spent all my time

625
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:45,698
chasing incarnations
of the Prophets

626
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:48,768
long-dead lovers,
Gunji jackdaws

627
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:50,972
blizzards, trollops...

628
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:52,413
Ah!

629
00:30:52,448 --> 00:30:56,282
As l always said,
a man without any imagination.

630
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:58,048
Come along, my dears.

631
00:30:58,087 --> 00:31:02,217
l'll show you what
a fertile imagination can do.

632
00:31:09,065 --> 00:31:10,054
lmagination...

633
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:16,702
Computer, run a level-1
personnel sweep of all pylons.

634
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:19,765
Requested function will take
approximately three minutes.

635
00:31:24,747 --> 00:31:30,652
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

636
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:32,746
Get the Nagus on subspace.

637
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:35,758
l want to talk to him,
and l mean now!

638
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,661
l'm not spending another minute
in this cell.

639
00:31:40,697 --> 00:31:42,494
How did you get in there?

640
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:45,194
How did l get in here?

641
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:47,532
You put me in here.

642
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,232
Oh...

643
00:31:50,273 --> 00:31:52,173
l guess l did, didn't l?

644
00:31:53,242 --> 00:31:54,300
Yeah.

645
00:31:56,813 --> 00:31:59,714
No imagination indeed. Ha!

646
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:21,002
Heads up, Jake.

647
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:22,766
So, what are you doing here?

648
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:24,670
l can't go.
l've got homework to do.

649
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:26,641
But you'd rather be
at the ballpark.

650
00:32:26,676 --> 00:32:27,768
You don't understand.

651
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,244
lf l go to the holosuite
without finishing my homework

652
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,246
my dad'll kill me.

653
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,338
Kill you?

654
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:33,576
Yeah.

655
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:36,244
You really believe
he'd kill you?

656
00:32:36,285 --> 00:32:38,014
l know he would.

657
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:39,316
Well, if that's true

658
00:32:39,355 --> 00:32:41,585
why you still thinking
about going?

659
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:43,319
l'm trying not to.

660
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,259
But you're wondering

661
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:47,489
if you can get away with it,
aren't you?

662
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,225
Well?

663
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:52,962
l couldn't understand
the directions.

664
00:32:53,002 --> 00:32:58,406
The computer accidentally erased
the instruction page.

665
00:32:58,441 --> 00:33:02,172
You really expect me
to believe that?

666
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:04,873
No, l guess not.

667
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:10,413
l've really got homework to do.

668
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:28,662
l need to see you, Benjamin.

669
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:31,638
What do you have, Dax?

670
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:35,303
ln the last hour alone,
the rupture's expanded 27%.

671
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:37,608
The rate of expansion
is increasing.

672
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:40,411
Can we gain any time
by moving the station?

673
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,781
lf the rift collapses

674
00:33:41,818 --> 00:33:45,015
the implosion would overtake us
almost immediately.

675
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:47,181
How soon can you
be ready, Chief?

676
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:48,918
l'm installing
pulse wave devices

677
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:50,653
in the torpedoes now,
Commander.

678
00:33:50,693 --> 00:33:52,160
Six, seven minutes.

679
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:55,631
The rift's gotten large enough
to pick up on visual scanners.

680
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:56,654
On screen.

681
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:02,067
Magnify.

682
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:53,347
All pylons are secured.

683
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,357
Everyone's been moved
to the Habitat Ring

684
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:57,154
for the time being.

685
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:58,353
You're worried.

686
00:34:58,394 --> 00:34:59,520
You bet l am.

687
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:00,790
lf this doesn't work

688
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,958
nothing real or imagined
is going to survive.

689
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:06,729
Hold me.

690
00:35:08,404 --> 00:35:09,894
Please.

691
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,505
Torpedoes ready.

692
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:15,408
Status of shields?

693
00:35:15,444 --> 00:35:18,140
All available power's
been transferred.

694
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:21,378
Reading shield strength
at 158% above normal.

695
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,214
Let's hope it's enough.

696
00:35:23,252 --> 00:35:24,549
Red Alert.

697
00:35:24,587 --> 00:35:25,952
Fire!

698
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:33,389
All systems functioning
properly.

699
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:36,227
Torpedo guidance
is on nominal track.

700
00:35:36,265 --> 00:35:38,563
30 seconds to coordinates.

701
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:41,263
lmpulse sustainer
throttling down.

702
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:43,499
Arming pulse wave initiator.

703
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:45,905
Torpedo hull temperature
dropping.

704
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:47,500
Activating pulse waves.

705
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:50,603
Compression level at 1,400
and rising.

706
00:35:50,646 --> 00:35:52,136
20 seconds.

707
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:54,672
Compression at 2,900.

708
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,207
3,000.

709
00:35:56,252 --> 00:35:58,311
Terminal targeting spread
confirmed.

710
00:35:58,354 --> 00:36:00,117
3,500.

711
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:01,521
Holding compression.

712
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:02,683
Ten seconds.

713
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:03,953
Ready to detonate.

714
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,254
Ready, sir.

715
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:06,659
Five seconds.

716
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:07,856
Now.

717
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:15,434
Wave intensity
from the rift is dropping.

718
00:36:15,471 --> 00:36:18,531
The thoron field boundary
is shrinking.

719
00:36:18,574 --> 00:36:20,337
Particle energy is rising.

720
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:23,305
Wait a minute.
What's this?

721
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:24,608
Wave emissions are fluctuating.

722
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:26,706
We're not getting
a controlled collapse.

723
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:27,909
Chief?

724
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,612
Damn it, we're picking up
an exothermic reaction pattern.

725
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:32,883
lt may be neutralizing
the pulse waves.

726
00:36:32,922 --> 00:36:34,219
Stand by.

727
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:36,919
Perimeter sensors are picking up
a subspace oscillation.

728
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,358
What the hell does that mean?

729
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:40,487
Proton counts have tripled.

730
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:42,971
Residual pulse wave activity
from our torpedoes

731
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:44,332
is down to 14%.

732
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:47,364
The flux density readings
inside the rupture

733
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:49,036
are off the scale.

734
00:37:00,188 --> 00:37:03,646
Odo to Ops!

735
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:05,852
Ops! Ops!

736
00:37:09,864 --> 00:37:12,492
Com circuits are down.

737
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:15,162
l'll try to reroute pathways.

738
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:16,830
Life support is normal.

739
00:37:16,871 --> 00:37:17,929
Shields.

740
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,295
A generator's down.

741
00:37:19,428 --> 00:37:20,918
Section Four is exposed.

742
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,327
Odo to Ops.

743
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,491
There we go.

744
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,466
Constable, check for casualties.

745
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:28,368
Have your deputies move
everybody out of Section Four.

746
00:37:28,404 --> 00:37:29,598
We have shield damage.

747
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:30,662
Acknowledged.

748
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,139
What are we getting
from the rift?

749
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:33,937
Sensors aren't operating.

750
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,635
Stand by, sir.

751
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,948
l can't feel my hands.

752
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,812
Lie still, lie still.

753
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:46,185
There's an emergency medical kit
in the cabinet there.

754
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,382
Get it.

755
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:50,350
l'm sorry...

756
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,258
Shh.

757
00:37:52,294 --> 00:37:54,319
Here you go.

758
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:57,127
l never meant to bother you.

759
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,963
No, no.

760
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:01,367
You didn't bother me.

761
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,805
l can't keep my eyes open.

762
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,637
Don't close your eyes.

763
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:07,903
l want you awake.

764
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,501
You have a nasty concussion.

765
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:14,911
l can't help it.

766
00:38:15,017 --> 00:38:16,314
Dax.

767
00:38:16,352 --> 00:38:17,478
Dax!

768
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,919
Sensors are back on line.

769
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:20,318
The rupture is continuing

770
00:38:20,356 --> 00:38:23,484
to widen... 340 times larger
than before.

771
00:38:23,526 --> 00:38:25,391
ls it showing
any signs of collapsing?

772
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,420
Wave emissions from the rift
are still fluctuating.

773
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:30,898
l can't make any sense
out of these readings.

774
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,026
Proton counts are lower
than before.

775
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:34,933
And now
they're beginning to rise again.

776
00:38:35,037 --> 00:38:37,062
The pulse waves
from our torpedoes

777
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,471
have been completely
neutralized.

778
00:38:38,507 --> 00:38:39,599
lt's just a matter of time

779
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:41,303
before the rift
starts expanding again.

780
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:42,503
How much time?

781
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:43,671
Minutes.

782
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,009
Suggestions.

783
00:38:49,218 --> 00:38:52,949
Run out of ideas, friend?

784
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:54,716
l have a suggestion.

785
00:38:54,757 --> 00:38:56,384
Maybe l can help.

786
00:38:56,425 --> 00:38:57,323
You?

787
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,327
You created me with powers

788
00:38:59,361 --> 00:39:01,352
beyond those of mortal men

789
00:39:01,397 --> 00:39:05,800
and l would be more than happy
to use them to assist you.

790
00:39:05,835 --> 00:39:07,496
For a price.

791
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,174
l've always wanted a daughter.

792
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:16,644
Miles?

793
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,112
Perimeter sensors are picking up

794
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,910
subspace oscillations again.

795
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,416
You're telling me you can seal
that rupture out there?

796
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:25,215
l can spin straw into gold,
my friend.

797
00:39:25,254 --> 00:39:27,313
This seems no more difficult.

798
00:39:27,356 --> 00:39:29,085
Well, do it, damn it!

799
00:39:29,124 --> 00:39:31,217
Will you meet my price?

800
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,922
This is crazy.

801
00:39:34,029 --> 00:39:38,261
You're out of a storybook,
a fairy tale.

802
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,929
Are you willing to give her up
to save so many others?

803
00:39:42,037 --> 00:39:43,595
No.

804
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,936
He doesn't have to.

805
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,838
Dax, when did our sensors

806
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:49,845
first pick up traces
of the rupture?

807
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:50,937
You were there, Benjamin.

808
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,446
When we were first
trying to figure

809
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:53,448
this whole thing out.

810
00:39:53,482 --> 00:39:54,779
And if l remember correctly

811
00:39:54,817 --> 00:39:56,717
you said
that your previous scans

812
00:39:56,752 --> 00:39:58,743
hadn't picked up
any anomalies at all.

813
00:39:58,787 --> 00:40:00,721
l thought whatever was out there

814
00:40:00,756 --> 00:40:03,350
was too small for the scanners
to identify.

815
00:40:03,392 --> 00:40:06,190
So you imagined
that we had a subspace rupture

816
00:40:06,228 --> 00:40:08,924
and that's exactly
what it turned out to be.

817
00:40:08,964 --> 00:40:11,694
That is what l imagined.

818
00:40:11,734 --> 00:40:13,702
And once you'd learned
about the rift

819
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:15,704
that destroyed the Hanoli system

820
00:40:15,738 --> 00:40:18,969
we all imagined that we might
have another just like it.

821
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:20,873
Mr. O'Brien, drop the shields.

822
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,968
Sir?

823
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:23,772
There is no rupture.

824
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:27,873
There is no threat
to this station, or this system.

825
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:30,385
End Red Alert
and drop the shields.

826
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:32,979
Aye, sir.

827
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:35,249
And believe it, Mr. O'Brien.

828
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:37,725
lt's important
that you believe it.

829
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,694
Aye, sir.

830
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,629
Are your sensors picking up
any magnetic shock waves, Major?

831
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:43,893
Yes, sir.

832
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:45,992
Perimeter readings still show...

833
00:40:46,101 --> 00:40:48,092
No shock waves at all.

834
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:51,633
None at all.

835
00:40:55,711 --> 00:40:57,838
Lieutenant, proton counts.

836
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,075
Normal.

837
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,552
lt's gone.

838
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,684
You're going to be fine.

839
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:11,852
Of course l am.

840
00:41:11,894 --> 00:41:15,057
l have the best doctor
in the galaxy.

841
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,202
None of this makes any sense.

842
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,970
l mean, why did they appear
in the first place?

843
00:41:28,043 --> 00:41:29,305
lt might still be related

844
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:31,108
to the elevated thoron emissions
in the plasma field.

845
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:33,740
The readings still
haven't returned to normal.

846
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,716
Continue your analysis, Dax

847
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:38,481
but, this time, no speculations

848
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,885
just facts.

849
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:41,253
Yes, Benjamin.

850
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,384
Major, keep us on Yellow Alert
for the next 26 hours

851
00:41:44,426 --> 00:41:47,987
till we see that everything
is back to normal.

852
00:41:48,097 --> 00:41:50,998
Chief, take your family home.

853
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,362
That's an order.

854
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:54,096
Aye, sir.

855
00:42:27,236 --> 00:42:29,568
This imagination of yours--

856
00:42:29,605 --> 00:42:31,072
it's a tough concept

857
00:42:31,106 --> 00:42:33,404
for us to get a handle on, Ben.

858
00:42:33,442 --> 00:42:36,434
You're not simply a figment
of my imagination, are you?

859
00:42:36,478 --> 00:42:39,879
We're on an extended mission
exploring the galaxy.

860
00:42:39,915 --> 00:42:41,974
A while back,
we followed one of your ships

861
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:43,813
through that hole in space
out there.

862
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,285
We've been watching you.

863
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,413
Trying to figure out
the rules of your game.

864
00:42:47,456 --> 00:42:50,550
Why didn't you just
talk to us like this?

865
00:42:50,592 --> 00:42:51,991
Well, we've learned
that you can never tell

866
00:42:52,094 --> 00:42:54,460
how someone will treat
the visiting team.

867
00:42:54,496 --> 00:42:56,487
l understand.

868
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,000
That's what this has been
all about--

869
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,592
learning to understand.

870
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:02,433
Was it really necessary

871
00:43:02,471 --> 00:43:05,338
to put the whole station
in jeopardy?

872
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,343
But we didn't, Ben.

873
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,208
lt was you.

874
00:43:10,245 --> 00:43:13,510
lt was your imaginations
that created everything.

875
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,677
We were just watching
to see where it took you.

876
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,085
Oh, this imagination of yours.

877
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:21,954
We have never seen
anything like it.

878
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,184
lt's very real to all of you

879
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,853
but yet it's not.

880
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,362
At first, it seemed to us
to be a curse

881
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,694
an irritation.

882
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,701
That Odo fellow
even called it a waste of time.

883
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,362
l disagree with him.

884
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,870
l knew you would.

885
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,735
l learned that about you.

886
00:43:37,773 --> 00:43:39,866
That you could have
such an affection

887
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,273
for someone you never even met.

888
00:43:42,277 --> 00:43:44,142
l wonder if you appreciate

889
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:48,343
how unique that imagination
of yours really is.

890
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,584
Not always.

891
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:54,350
We got to go.

892
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:58,291
But you haven't told us anything
about your species.

893
00:43:58,327 --> 00:44:00,659
l'd like to.

894
00:44:00,696 --> 00:44:02,687
Maybe next year.
