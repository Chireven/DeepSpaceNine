1
00:00:02,694 --> 00:00:06,152
Station Log, Stardate 46910.1.

2
00:00:06,231 --> 00:00:08,165
Chief O'Brien
has escorted his wife

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,533
back to Earth to celebrate
her mother's 100th birthday.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,095
ln the meantime,
the rest of us are trying

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,334
to keep the station
up and running.

6
00:00:20,212 --> 00:00:23,010
lt's almost as if the
refiltration processors

7
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:25,516
were waiting for
Chief O'Brien to leave

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,881
before breaking down.

9
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:30,012
This technology looks like
something the Cardassians

10
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:32,080
must have taken
from the Romulans.

11
00:00:32,124 --> 00:00:34,854
ls that an RCL type-1
matrix field?

12
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:38,522
Perhaps we should call in
a Romulan repair service.

13
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:40,087
Or an RCL type-2?

14
00:00:40,132 --> 00:00:42,498
Another <i>raktajino?</i>

15
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:44,331
lt'll keep me up all night.

16
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:47,031
l can think of better
ways of keeping you up

17
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:50,166
and they're more fun
than drinking Klingon coffee.

18
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,642
Definitely type-1.

19
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,689
Dax.

20
00:01:18,804 --> 00:01:21,170
l really should be
getting to bed.

21
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,504
May l escort you
to your quarters?

22
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,840
That's not necessary, Julian.

23
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,174
Oh.

24
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,873
Well, good night, then.

25
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:47,563
''Not necessary, Julian.''

26
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,901
But not forbidden, either.

27
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:02,980
Dax.

28
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:06,108
Yes.

29
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:07,982
You are Dax?

30
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:09,611
What do you want?

31
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,997
Dax!

32
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:57,181
Yes, Major?

33
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:59,417
l'm just not sure, Commander.

34
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:02,017
What does it look like to you?

35
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,291
lt looks like a residual charge
in the graviton generator.

36
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,560
lf that's what it is,
it will bleed off.

37
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,932
Let's run a quick level-3
diagnostic, just to be sure.

38
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:16,401
Bashir to Ops.

39
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,408
Ops.

40
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,568
Three people...

41
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,740
l think they just took Jadzia.

42
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,239
She tried to struggle with them,
and l tried to help, but...

43
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,979
Full station security alert.

44
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,418
Secure all turbolifts.

45
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,423
Seal off airlocks
on levels four through 12.

46
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,425
Computer, locate Lieutenant Dax.

47
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,053
Lieutenant Dax is on level six,
corridor one.

48
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,959
No, that's where l am.

49
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:40,828
They just left her combadge.

50
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:42,264
How long ago, Doctor?

51
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,200
Oh, l'm not sure, really.

52
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:46,135
What are you doing?

53
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,805
We turn right
at the next corridor.

54
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,985
They're managing to avoid
the security tracking grid.

55
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:03,385
They seem to know a lot
about the station.

56
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:05,855
Then they may know
the speed of our runabouts.

57
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,517
lf they do, they probably have

58
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,493
a faster ship
to make their escape.

59
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:12,223
Major, survey all ships in dock
with a high warp capability.

60
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,036
Damn!

61
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:20,229
What?

62
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:21,829
That's why we've got
a residual charge

63
00:06:21,873 --> 00:06:23,033
in the graviton generator.

64
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:25,507
They've disabled
the tractor beam.

65
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:27,909
We've got eight ships in dock
capable of warp five or more.

66
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:30,414
Three on docking pylons,
five smaller ones in the ports.

67
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:32,313
Seal off
all docking ring airlocks.

68
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,046
Security, all duty squads
to the docking ring.

69
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:38,384
Commence immediate inward
sweep, levels 16 through 21.

70
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:58,201
l've got them-- Airlock 5.

71
00:06:58,243 --> 00:06:59,403
l'm on my way.

72
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:01,878
Security, report to airlock,
corridor five.

73
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:03,380
We have a hostage situation.

74
00:07:03,414 --> 00:07:05,644
lsolating with
cadderon force fields.

75
00:07:06,684 --> 00:07:09,744
Will you just tell me
what you want?

76
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:25,100
Move.

77
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,571
Force field is down.

78
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:36,739
They know
the security override codes.

79
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:38,749
They're boarding a ship.

80
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:41,411
l'm trying to speed up
the bleed-off process

81
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:43,044
in the graviton generator.

82
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,315
We lost them.

83
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:51,658
lt's working.

84
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:55,063
l'm increasing the flow
to the EPS wave guides.

85
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,067
The excess charge
is neutralizing.

86
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,331
Engage tractor beam.

87
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:07,742
Gotcha.

88
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:12,080
Bring it in
to Docking Port 6, Major.

89
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:23,424
Slowly!

90
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:27,390
Extremities
where l can see them.

91
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:29,423
You're the Chief of Security?

92
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,635
Are you all right?

93
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:40,906
My name is llon Tandro

94
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:42,913
special envoy from Klaestron lV

95
00:08:42,947 --> 00:08:45,381
in charge of this
extradition procedure.

96
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,748
Extradition? l call this
kidnapping and assault.

97
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:50,253
You'll find that to be
a valid warrant for her arrest.

98
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:51,448
The relevant treaty

99
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,582
between Klaestron lV
and your Federation

100
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:55,455
allows for unilateral
extradition.

101
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,551
And the charge?

102
00:08:56,594 --> 00:09:01,691
The fugitive Dax
is charged with treason...

103
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:04,167
and the murder of my father.

104
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:21,184
The warrant says
Dax was responsible

105
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:24,188
for the death
of General Ardelon Tandro

106
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:25,689
30 years ago.

107
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:27,190
30 years ago?

108
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:28,852
That would have been Curzon Dax.

109
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:32,795
Mmm, when he was on Klaestron lV

110
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,527
as a Federation mediator
during their civil war.

111
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:39,127
He never mentioned
he'd even been to Klaestron lV.

112
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,137
Strange.

113
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:43,470
Not so strange,
considering these charges.

114
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:45,499
Odo, let me tell you something.

115
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,569
Curzon Dax tended to be
a little cavalier about life

116
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:51,047
even about his personal
responsibilities

117
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:52,309
from time to time.

118
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:56,751
l think that was
part of the reason

119
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:58,187
l liked him so much.

120
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,814
He had more faults

121
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:03,520
than the usual
socially acceptable Trill.

122
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,756
He was not a murderer.

123
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:08,391
How about a traitor?

124
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,765
lt says Dax betrayed
the Klaestron government

125
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:11,962
to the rebels.

126
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:13,402
lt's all nonsense, Constable.

127
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:14,769
l'm telling you l knew the man.

128
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:19,402
But did you know
the symbiont inside the man?

129
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:29,285
Come in.

130
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,590
l've sent a subspace message
to Klaestron lV

131
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:38,595
requesting confirmation
of the warrant.

132
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:41,757
That's the only stall
l could think of.

133
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:45,633
Now, what the hell's going on,
Dax?

134
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:48,636
Dax.

135
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:51,301
lf l'm going to help you,
you've got to help me.

136
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:54,209
l don't expect any help,
Benjamin.

137
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:55,678
Thank you, though.

138
00:10:55,713 --> 00:10:57,237
Are you crazy?!

139
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,215
Treason and murder--

140
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,649
on Klaestron lV

141
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:04,712
either of those gets you
the death penalty.

142
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:11,092
What's the matter with you?

143
00:11:12,263 --> 00:11:15,426
Talk to me, before l have
to let these people take you.

144
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,527
No. l'm sorry, Benjamin,
but no.

145
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:35,082
We've got 18, 20 years
of friendship behind us.

146
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:37,587
l'm Jadzia Dax now.

147
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:40,182
That was Curzon Dax
you knew for 20 years.

148
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:42,215
So when the Dax part
of you survived

149
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,727
from one host to the next

150
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:46,195
it really didn't take
our friendship along.

151
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,562
Benjamin, you know

152
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,794
you're still
my very dear friend.

153
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:56,195
l'm sorry.

154
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:01,707
You've received
your confirmation, Commander.

155
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:04,647
Now we'd like to be
on our way with the prisoner.

156
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,843
You know, Mr. Tandro,
l kept wondering

157
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:09,045
why you tried to kidnap
Lieutenant Dax

158
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:11,213
rather than just present
your warrant to me

159
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:12,222
in the proper way.

160
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:14,107
l couldn't figure
that out at first.

161
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,003
l trust you have figured out,
Commander

162
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:18,907
that our extradition treaty
with your Federation

163
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,242
is current and valid.

164
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,305
This station is
technically Bajoran.

165
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:24,213
What does that mean to us?

166
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,946
You don't have an extradition
treaty with Bajor.

167
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:29,147
l think that's why you tried
to abduct

168
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:30,281
Lieutenant Dax.

169
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:33,156
You were afraid the Bajorans
would refuse extradition.

170
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:34,319
That's absurd.

171
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,022
No Bajoran interests
are even involved here.

172
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,622
How did you know your way
around this station so well?

173
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:43,898
My conversation
is with the Commander.

174
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:45,234
No, your conversation

175
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:47,569
is with my First Officer now.

176
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:50,235
You Klaestrons are allies
of the Cardassians.

177
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:51,903
Your knowledge of this station
confirms that.

178
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:53,276
They must have
given you the layout

179
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:57,010
which not only compromises
Bajoran security

180
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,508
but also... annoys us.

181
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:03,545
l'm afraid Bajoran interests
are involved

182
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,717
and Bajor is adamant that--

183
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:08,420
at least, l believe
it's adamant.

184
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:09,621
Oh. Oh, yes.

185
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:12,153
You see, there will have
to be an extradition hearing

186
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:15,258
before l can lawfully
release Lieutenant Dax.

187
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:22,434
For how long?

188
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:24,443
As long as it takes.

189
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:26,445
That could be for days.

190
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:29,448
Well, there's nowhere else
on the station that's suitable.

191
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:31,006
That's too bad.

192
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,019
l'm not shutting down
for any Bajoran hearing.

193
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:37,045
l'm sure Lieutenant Dax
would appreciate it.

194
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,194
Business is business.

195
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:43,593
Ah.

196
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:50,024
You know, that wall's
going to have to come in

197
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:51,468
about five meters.

198
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:53,472
What are you talking about?

199
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:56,475
Of course, after you move
the wall, that'll mean

200
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:59,967
your second-level holosuites
will have to come down.

201
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,480
Come down? Why?

202
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:03,573
New restrictions.

203
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:05,709
Restrictions?

204
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:07,151
Building codes.

205
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:09,654
Since the provisional
government took over

206
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:12,157
they've got their hands
into everything

207
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:14,659
and, of course,
l'm the one who's expected

208
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:16,753
to enforce their rules here.

209
00:14:16,796 --> 00:14:18,855
Ha.

210
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:23,502
You know, l think this bar

211
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:26,528
is just a little
too near the exit.

212
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:30,169
This is blackmail.

213
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,541
No, it's just business.

214
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:38,142
And business is business.

215
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:50,554
l was just coming to see you.

216
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:52,621
We still haven't found
a place for the hearing.

217
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:54,030
Holding it on Bajor
would involve

218
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,032
Dax leaving the station

219
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,398
and l don't want to risk that.

220
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:57,960
Well, now that's a coincidence.

221
00:14:58,004 --> 00:15:00,131
Our good friend Quark
just donated the use

222
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:01,800
of his facility
for the hearing.

223
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:03,206
Nice gesture.

224
00:15:03,242 --> 00:15:04,709
l thought so.

225
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:06,371
You know, l haven't been able

226
00:15:06,412 --> 00:15:08,846
to get a word out of Dax
about any of this.

227
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:10,974
So l thought someone
might go do some investigating

228
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:12,312
on Klaestron lV itself.

229
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:13,649
What do you think?

230
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:15,984
This case has 30 years
of dust covering it.

231
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:18,786
The extradition hearing
will take about 30 minutes.

232
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:21,191
l was hoping to make it
a little longer than that.

233
00:15:21,227 --> 00:15:23,218
Good luck.

234
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:44,012
This will be an informal hearing

235
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:46,950
so l'm going to start
with some informal advice.

236
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:49,011
l am 100 years old.

237
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:50,147
l do not have time

238
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:53,022
to squander listening
to superfluous language.

239
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:56,687
ln short, l intend
being here until supper

240
00:15:56,729 --> 00:15:57,855
not senility.

241
00:15:57,897 --> 00:15:59,728
Understood?

242
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,963
Understood, Madam Arbiter.

243
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:08,297
You seek the extradition.

244
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:09,808
Make your case.

245
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:13,801
The accused Trill, whatever
its present appearance may be

246
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:16,314
was and is a Federation officer

247
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:19,318
who committed capital
crimes on our planet.

248
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:21,820
Since there is no time limit

249
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:24,379
on the prosecution
of such crimes...

250
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:27,882
Thank you, l have already read
the warrant and the charges.

251
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:30,896
The crimes described
are 30 years old.

252
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,194
What took you so long?

253
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:35,530
The evidence was contained
in military files

254
00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:38,537
which were officially sealed
until recently.

255
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:39,833
Fine. Sit.

256
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:46,009
Commander, the warrant
is in order.

257
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:49,570
On what grounds do you ask
that l deny extradition?

258
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:52,015
You say the warrant's in order

259
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:54,519
but the name
on the warrant is Dax.

260
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:58,012
Certainly that doesn't refer
to Jadzia Dax, a female

261
00:16:58,057 --> 00:17:01,288
but to the now deceased
Curzon Dax, a male.

262
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:04,296
This young woman wasn't
even born 30 years ago.

263
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,797
You are arguing semantics.

264
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:07,800
This creature is a Trill.

265
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:09,802
The symbiont known as Dax

266
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:12,805
has progressed
from one host to the next.

267
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,272
Exactly. From one host
to the next.

268
00:17:14,307 --> 00:17:15,831
A different host,
a different person.

269
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,173
So l submit that the person
he wants to extradite

270
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:19,576
no longer exists

271
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:21,409
and l challenge him
to prove otherwise.

272
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:22,744
That's ridiculous.

273
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,682
lt would have been easier

274
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:28,517
on me, Commander, had you not
raised that particular point

275
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:32,991
but the penalty for these crimes
on your planet is death

276
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:34,993
and that is rather permanent

277
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:37,359
so before l grant extradition

278
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:38,863
you will convince me, please

279
00:17:38,898 --> 00:17:41,594
that the person
named in your warrant

280
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:44,296
is the person
who is standing here now.

281
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:04,254
She doesn't seem to care

282
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,383
whether she gets
out of this or not.

283
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:08,120
l care.

284
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,855
Doctor, we've given
the opposition

285
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:12,194
access to our computers
and station library

286
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:13,823
so let's utilize them ourselves.

287
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:16,767
l want you to find
all the medical evidence you can

288
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:18,895
to support the theory
that Jadzia Dax

289
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:21,600
and Curzon Dax are two
entirely separate people.

290
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:22,608
Major...

291
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:23,768
Excuse me, sir.

292
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:26,801
l don't know that there is
any medical evidence on that.

293
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:28,711
Assume there is, then find it.

294
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:31,273
Major, l'm not asking you
to be an attorney here

295
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:34,115
but if you could check
the Federation computers

296
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:35,415
for any precedents...

297
00:18:35,454 --> 00:18:37,718
legal decisions
involving Trills.

298
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:40,282
ls a Trill responsible
for the conduct--

299
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:43,295
for the acts--
of its antecedent selves?

300
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:44,956
Right, that kind of thing.

301
00:18:44,997 --> 00:18:47,227
What if l find
the answer is ''yes''?

302
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:49,291
Then that answer is wrong.

303
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:52,463
From this minute on,
our answer is ''no.''

304
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,443
But if you do find
a wrong answer...

305
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:01,127
l want to see it.

306
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,888
l can't fight
what l don't know about.

307
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:06,692
Commander Sisko, there's
a subspace communication

308
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:08,393
from Odo on Klaestron lV.

309
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:10,197
We only have a few hours,
people.

310
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,573
What have you got for us,
Constable?

311
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,908
Well, l know two things so far--

312
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:23,211
whoever did murder
that General Ardelon Tandro

313
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,910
it got his troops so mad

314
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:27,680
they went out
and won their civil war.

315
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,018
They made the general
a national hero.

316
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:33,082
There are statues of him
all over the place.

317
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,219
The second-- everyone
that's old enough to remember

318
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:39,925
says the General and Curzon Dax
were the closest of friends.

319
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:41,364
Comrades, inseparable.

320
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,233
Now that sounds
like the Curzon Dax l knew.

321
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,430
But treason...

322
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:47,939
plus the murder
of his own best friend?

323
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:49,372
Strange business.

324
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:51,069
lf those charges are true

325
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,409
l'd want to hang Curzon Dax
up by his heels myself.

326
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:56,244
Thanks for the confidence.

327
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:57,249
Don't worry.

328
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:58,409
l'll do my job.

329
00:19:58,451 --> 00:20:00,112
The General left a widow.

330
00:20:00,152 --> 00:20:02,211
lf the two men were that close

331
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:05,122
she has to remember something
about Curzon Dax

332
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:06,749
that's not in the record.

333
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,089
You'll hear from me.

334
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:21,733
Curzon Dax was not responsible
for the death of my husband.

335
00:20:21,774 --> 00:20:23,366
You're certain of that?

336
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:24,740
Without a doubt.

337
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:26,972
But your own son...?

338
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:28,980
My son is obsessed

339
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,415
with the death of a father
he never knew.

340
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:35,978
Oh, l tried to persuade him
not to reopen the case.

341
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:39,717
He won't listen to anyone,
least of all to me.

342
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,386
You have to understand

343
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:44,225
Curzon Dax was closer
to the General

344
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:47,096
than any other man
on this planet.

345
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:49,567
He was a dear friend
to this family.

346
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:51,570
Curzon would have died himself

347
00:20:51,604 --> 00:20:54,505
sooner than conspire
against my husband.

348
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,098
ls that a personal opinion

349
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,474
or are there any facts
that would support this?

350
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:02,140
The only facts l have
are in my son's hands

351
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:04,513
and he intends to use
them against Dax.

352
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,383
lt might help my people
to know what they are.

353
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,754
There is proof
of a secret transmission

354
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,760
that was made
from our military headquarters

355
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:16,261
to the enemy camp.

356
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:20,789
lt identifies exactly the route
my husband was taking

357
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,961
on his way back
from the capital to the front.

358
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:27,767
lt was at that time that he
was ambushed and kidnapped.

359
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:29,900
A short time later,
he was killed.

360
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:35,278
Then your son must believe
that Dax made the transmission.

361
00:21:35,314 --> 00:21:38,545
There were only five people,
including my husband

362
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:39,949
who knew that route.

363
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:43,443
My son has established the
whereabouts of all of them

364
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:45,582
at the time of the transmission.

365
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:48,092
All of them except Curzon.

366
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:52,587
So Dax has no alibi.

367
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:58,092
That cannot possibly be
enough to convict him.

368
00:21:58,137 --> 00:21:59,434
Can it?

369
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:01,303
l don't know.

370
00:22:03,743 --> 00:22:04,801
Thank you.

371
00:22:04,844 --> 00:22:06,334
You've been helpful.

372
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:13,949
How is he?

373
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:15,350
Ma'am?

374
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:18,357
Curzon Dax.

375
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,624
He's gone.

376
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,925
The Dax your son is
trying to extradite

377
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:26,488
is Jadzia Dax

378
00:22:26,532 --> 00:22:28,591
a 28-year-old woman.

379
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:30,966
Curzon Dax died two years ago.

380
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,834
Jadzia is the new host.

381
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,835
Wha...?

382
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:40,141
l'm sorry.

383
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:42,670
l didn't know.

384
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:58,722
Madam Arbiter, l call
on the expert knowledge

385
00:22:58,764 --> 00:23:00,994
of another Trill, Selin Peers.

386
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:04,897
Minister Peers

387
00:23:04,937 --> 00:23:07,030
we're fortunate
to have you with us.

388
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:09,472
Excuse me, it also seems
rather convenient

389
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:10,702
to have you with us.

390
00:23:10,743 --> 00:23:11,710
How do you come here?

391
00:23:11,744 --> 00:23:13,268
Because another Trill
is involved

392
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:14,438
the Trillian government

393
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,948
requested that l be present
during the extradition.

394
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:19,280
And do you know
the accused personally?

395
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:21,912
l do not.

396
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:24,149
We accept you
as an expert on Trills.

397
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,157
Proceed.

398
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:26,624
Minister

399
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:29,321
through how many hosts
have you survived?

400
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:31,955
The symbiont within me
has survived

401
00:23:32,064 --> 00:23:35,693
through the adult lifetimes
of seven hosts.

402
00:23:35,734 --> 00:23:38,168
Do you remember
your very first host?

403
00:23:38,204 --> 00:23:40,536
Of course.

404
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:42,905
lt was a woman,
as a matter of fact.

405
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:46,708
Do you remember
what you thought and felt

406
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:49,680
when you were joined
with your first host?

407
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:52,081
Yes. The symbiont
does carry memories

408
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:54,347
of time shared
with previous hosts.

409
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:56,877
So, if a crime
is committed by a Trill

410
00:23:56,922 --> 00:24:00,380
then the symbiont's next host
would remain aware of it--

411
00:24:00,426 --> 00:24:02,656
would recall that crime.

412
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,925
Yes. Absolutely.

413
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,123
Would recall the details of it.

414
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,566
Yes, absolutely.

415
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:12,696
And would still
feel the guilt of it.

416
00:24:12,738 --> 00:24:14,603
Oh, yes.

417
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,800
Madam Arbiter,
this is not a trial

418
00:24:15,841 --> 00:24:18,139
and Mr. Tandro is
not the prosecutor.

419
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:19,940
Mr. Tandro,
you have made your point.

420
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:23,380
l don't believe that l have,
Madam Arbiter.

421
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:26,111
The real point is
that Commander Sisko

422
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:30,315
would have you endorse his idea
of a perfect Trill crime.

423
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:31,948
To commit it, all one has to do

424
00:24:31,991 --> 00:24:34,357
is elude capture long
enough to change hosts

425
00:24:34,393 --> 00:24:37,851
and then he or she can go free.

426
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:42,297
Minister Peers, you've said

427
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:46,430
you were with your first host
throughout her adult life.

428
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:47,564
Yes.

429
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:50,666
So, before a symbiont
is joined with any host

430
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:51,971
that host has lived

431
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:54,807
a significant portion
of his or her life

432
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:56,872
from birth to what age, sir?

433
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,941
Early to mid-20s.

434
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:00,212
Why not younger?

435
00:25:00,252 --> 00:25:04,882
To give the prospective host
a chance to develop, mature.

436
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:08,519
They have to be old enough
to make an informed judgment

437
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:11,928
as to whether or not
they really want to be joined.

438
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:15,024
And once they are joined,
this host's personality

439
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:17,763
is completely suppressed
by the symbiont.

440
00:25:17,803 --> 00:25:18,770
Oh, no.

441
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:21,739
No, it's a joining.

442
00:25:21,774 --> 00:25:24,038
lt's a total sharing--

443
00:25:24,076 --> 00:25:27,671
a blending
of both symbiont and host.

444
00:25:27,713 --> 00:25:30,614
Neither is suppressed
by the other.

445
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:32,048
So with each new host

446
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:35,110
there does come, in fact,
a new personality--

447
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:36,644
a new combined person...

448
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:37,951
a different person.

449
00:25:38,023 --> 00:25:40,389
From that standpoint, yes.

450
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:43,224
Well, l, for one, don't know
from what other standpoint

451
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:44,889
we could be talking about.

452
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,192
Thank you, Minister.

453
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:47,357
Just to return us

454
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:49,959
to what's important here,
Madam Arbiter

455
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:51,559
the accused can remember

456
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:53,970
any crimes he committed
as Curzon Dax

457
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,507
and nothing can be
truthfully asserted

458
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:59,238
in this hearing
that can alter that fact.

459
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,145
Yes. The memories were passed
to an entirely new host--

460
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:03,808
to an entirely
different person.

461
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:04,907
This is outrageous!

462
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:08,350
You-You can't let Dax
get away with murder!

463
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:12,483
Gentlemen, l said this would be
an informal hearing

464
00:26:12,524 --> 00:26:13,923
not riotous.

465
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:18,194
We will take a two-hour recess.

466
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,837
The answer seems
simple enough to me--

467
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:33,000
split her down the middle.

468
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:36,011
Send the symbiont
back to stand trial

469
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,910
and keep the host here.

470
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:40,608
l'm afraid it's a bit more
complicated than that.

471
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,016
Oh, what a surprise.

472
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:44,576
Please enlighten me.

473
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,317
The symbiont and the host
are biologically interdependent.

474
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,222
93 hours after they've joined

475
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:52,750
neither can survive
without the other.

476
00:26:52,795 --> 00:26:54,160
l see.

477
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:58,459
Proceed, Commander.

478
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:01,402
Doctor, you've heard
the arguments.

479
00:27:01,437 --> 00:27:03,598
From a medical point of view

480
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:07,200
are Curzon Dax and Jadzia Dax
the same person?

481
00:27:07,243 --> 00:27:08,471
Certainly not.

482
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:12,038
Aside from the gender change,
there's a marked difference

483
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:14,709
in blood types, metabolism,
nervous system

484
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,808
height, weight.

485
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:17,648
This is not at all relevant.

486
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:20,656
What is relevant, sir...

487
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,022
is my analysis
of the brain waves

488
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,993
of Curzon and Jadzia Dax.

489
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:26,995
Madam Arbiter.

490
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:30,863
As you can see, they are
distinctly different

491
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,267
which clearly illustrates
that Curzon and Jadzia

492
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:37,067
are two unique individuals.

493
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,698
Thank you, Doctor.

494
00:27:43,312 --> 00:27:44,472
Doctor...

495
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:48,677
l've looked through
your research myself.

496
00:27:48,718 --> 00:27:50,709
lt's quite impressive
for such a young man.

497
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,721
Thank you.

498
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:55,246
As a layman,
there are obviously things

499
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,918
l don't fully understand.

500
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,427
l'd be happy
to explain anything you wish.

501
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:00,952
Yes?

502
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:06,628
Well, exactly how does
the Trill brain work?

503
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:09,035
lt's quite complicated,
actually.

504
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,972
First of all, there are
two cerebral nuclei...

505
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:13,133
Two?

506
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:15,336
One in the symbiont
and one in the host.

507
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:16,640
Two brains.

508
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,614
And these two brains
talk to each other?

509
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:21,479
Like two computers
linked together.

510
00:28:21,517 --> 00:28:23,144
That's very clear, Doctor.

511
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:24,311
Thank you.

512
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:27,652
Now, in your investigations

513
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,821
were you able to analyze the...
separate wave patterns

514
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:34,727
from each of these brains?

515
00:28:34,764 --> 00:28:37,324
They don't function separately.

516
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:40,995
l didn't ask you
how they function, Dr. Bashir.

517
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:45,132
l asked if you could analyze
the two distinct patterns.

518
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:46,436
l don't see the relevance...

519
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,601
Could you?

520
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:48,769
Yes.

521
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,540
And have the brain wave patterns

522
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:51,807
of the symbiont changed

523
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:53,712
since it joined
with its new host?

524
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:56,775
With the available evidence,
there's no way of telling.

525
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,218
What's your best guess?

526
00:28:58,254 --> 00:29:00,552
l wouldn't care to guess.

527
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:03,353
ln fact, is there evidence
of any change at all

528
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:06,384
in the symbiont since it joined
with its new host?

529
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:07,418
Yes or no.

530
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,066
No.

531
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:18,869
Thank you, Dr. Bashir.

532
00:29:18,908 --> 00:29:20,967
You've been very helpful.

533
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:34,315
Any more witnesses,
Commander Sisko?

534
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,983
Yes, Madam Arbiter.

535
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:39,256
l'd like to call
the one person in this courtroom

536
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:40,660
who knew Curzon Dax.

537
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:41,822
Me.

538
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:45,231
You know where
the witness stand is.

539
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,165
With your permission

540
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:54,301
l'd like Major Kira
to direct the questions.

541
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:05,342
Tell us a little
about Curzon Dax, Commander.

542
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,015
He probably wasn't
the ideal Trill.

543
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:10,582
He drank a little too much.

544
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,355
He could be more interested
in women

545
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,918
than maybe he should have been.

546
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:15,692
l thought he was your friend.

547
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,256
l'm simply pointing out
that he was not at all

548
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,291
like the young woman
in this courtroom.

549
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,369
What was, exactly,
your relationship

550
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,398
with Curzon Dax?

551
00:30:27,443 --> 00:30:30,173
He took a raw, young ensign
under his wing

552
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:32,373
and taught me to appreciate life

553
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:35,042
in ways
l'd never thought about before.

554
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:39,885
He taught me about art
and science and diplomacy.

555
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:42,720
Whatever sense of honor
l might have today

556
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,487
he nurtured.

557
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:49,965
Treason, murder-- he was
not capable of those things.

558
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:51,261
As you've already said

559
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,495
Commander,
this is not a trial.

560
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:56,164
l'm describing my friend,
Curzon Dax--

561
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:58,105
a man l knew very well.

562
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,837
On the other hand,
l can't tell you too much

563
00:31:01,877 --> 00:31:03,902
about my new friend there.

564
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:07,608
We're really just getting
to know each other.

565
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:13,520
Commander, Starfleet officers
do have the reputation

566
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:15,183
of being honorable

567
00:31:15,224 --> 00:31:18,125
and l judge you to be
an honorable man.

568
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,186
As an honorable man,
do you think this crime

569
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,164
should go unpunished?

570
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:25,723
l prefer no crime
to go unpunished.

571
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:29,226
Then, if it were possible,
even you would not argue

572
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:31,933
with punishing
the symbiont part of Dax.

573
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:34,805
How can you be so sure
that the symbiont

574
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:36,708
was the criminal influence?

575
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:40,340
What if it were the Curzon host
that was responsible?

576
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:44,318
Then the surviving symbiont
would be completely innocent.

577
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:46,378
No. They'd both be guilty.

578
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:50,358
You yourself have argued
that the two personalities

579
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:52,690
once joined, function as one.

580
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:55,322
Your own Dr. Bashir
confirmed it.

581
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:57,832
When you put salt in water

582
00:31:57,866 --> 00:32:01,859
the two become indistinguishable
and inseparable.

583
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:05,499
l think you've just made
my point for me.

584
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,338
When the water boils off

585
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:10,311
the salt returns
to its original state.

586
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:13,213
Pour that same salt
into another liquid

587
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:16,513
and you have something
completely different.

588
00:32:16,552 --> 00:32:18,349
Jadzia Dax
is an entirely new entity.

589
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:22,084
Following a one-hour recess

590
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:26,356
Lieutenant Dax will take
the witness stand.

591
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:28,226
One hour.

592
00:32:41,744 --> 00:32:45,908
lf you won't defend yourself,
you're not going to testify.

593
00:32:45,948 --> 00:32:48,940
lt's a hearing, not a trial.

594
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:50,508
She has no choice.

595
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:01,254
Sir.

596
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:04,989
Odo's on subspace.

597
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:06,262
lt's urgent.

598
00:33:10,831 --> 00:33:12,321
l've made some progress.

599
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:13,333
Good.

600
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,664
Not good.

601
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:18,160
Since the transmission to
the enemy is the key evidence

602
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,173
l thought it might be
a good idea

603
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,141
to go through
all the communications logs

604
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,144
from headquarters
during that period.

605
00:33:24,178 --> 00:33:26,669
l even found
Curzon Dax's records.

606
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:28,181
You can't tell me Curzon

607
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,615
would log in a communiqué
to the enemy.

608
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:31,913
No, nothing like that

609
00:33:31,986 --> 00:33:35,217
but the log does show
a number of conversations

610
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:38,521
between Dax's office
and General Tandro's home.

611
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,787
They were close friends.

612
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:41,385
A number of the conversations

613
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:44,295
took place while the General
was away at the front.

614
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:49,701
-The wife.
-The wife.

615
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:55,669
Curzon Dax and Enina Tandro.

616
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:57,938
Maybe it was innocent.

617
00:33:57,978 --> 00:34:00,947
Maybe he was just providing
a little emotional support

618
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:02,039
during tough times.

619
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,414
Or maybe they were
taking advantage

620
00:34:04,451 --> 00:34:07,750
of the General's absence
to get a little closer.

621
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:10,018
lf they were having an affair

622
00:34:10,057 --> 00:34:14,255
that translates into a pretty
solid motive for murder.

623
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,130
The conversations
were just the beginning.

624
00:34:27,174 --> 00:34:28,903
l've also found records of gifts

625
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:31,912
of holidays spent at an inn
outside the capital.

626
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,436
Oh. What purpose
does this serve?

627
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,674
lt serves the truth.

628
00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:36,012
Oh, the truth.

629
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,642
lf there's more to this
than meets the eye

630
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:39,585
l hope you'll explain,
because as it stands

631
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,418
this will severely hurt
Dax's defense.

632
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,291
My husband was not the hero
in life

633
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:52,231
that he was in death, Mr. Odo.

634
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:54,564
ln death, he became a legend

635
00:34:54,602 --> 00:34:56,900
and l became a legend's wife.

636
00:34:56,937 --> 00:35:00,031
There are people who did not
even know my husband

637
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:01,541
who still contact me.

638
00:35:01,575 --> 00:35:04,567
Decades after his death,
they still mourn him.

639
00:35:04,612 --> 00:35:05,579
But you don't.

640
00:35:05,613 --> 00:35:06,841
No

641
00:35:06,881 --> 00:35:10,044
because l knew the man
before he became a legend.

642
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:12,416
But l also know
my place in history.

643
00:35:12,453 --> 00:35:15,718
My place is to carry on
bravely, never to remarry--

644
00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:18,156
to represent my husband
at the banquets

645
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:19,489
given in his name.

646
00:35:19,526 --> 00:35:22,893
But never, never to talk
about who he really was.

647
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:27,457
Because nobody
wants to hear that.

648
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,560
They may have to hear it now.

649
00:35:29,603 --> 00:35:31,070
No matter what is said

650
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:35,599
they will still embrace
his memory...

651
00:35:38,612 --> 00:35:44,016
for he was and always will be

652
00:35:44,051 --> 00:35:47,714
the hero
who died for his people.

653
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,924
But perhaps it's time

654
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:57,191
for my place in history
to change.

655
00:36:04,238 --> 00:36:07,036
You've been protecting
her reputation.

656
00:36:07,074 --> 00:36:09,702
That's it, isn't it?

657
00:36:09,743 --> 00:36:12,075
That's why you won't
even defend yourself.

658
00:36:17,418 --> 00:36:21,616
There are worse things
than an illicit love affair.

659
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:24,089
Curzon didn't murder anybody.

660
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:26,285
He didn't commit treason.

661
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:28,727
Are you really willing
to commit suicide

662
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:31,196
over something done
in another lifetime?

663
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,426
That is what you're doing,
you know.

664
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:39,167
My God, Dax.

665
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:42,004
Young Tandro--
that wouldn't be your son?

666
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:44,840
You have an overactive
imagination, Benjamin.

667
00:36:44,878 --> 00:36:47,005
Then what is it
that's holding you back?

668
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:48,036
Help me.

669
00:36:50,718 --> 00:36:54,051
Damn it, if you were
still a man...

670
00:36:58,726 --> 00:37:00,694
l see your temper
hasn't improved.

671
00:37:00,728 --> 00:37:03,026
Don't talk to me
about my temper.

672
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:04,690
Curzon always
warned you about it.

673
00:37:04,732 --> 00:37:07,633
You're not going
to get me off track here.

674
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:10,967
Do you remember
that Argosian Lieutenant

675
00:37:11,005 --> 00:37:13,667
who threw a drink in your face?

676
00:37:18,912 --> 00:37:21,813
And you knocked me down
with a right cross

677
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:23,544
before l could kill him.

678
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:27,076
l still have a little scar here
from your ring finger.

679
00:37:28,856 --> 00:37:36,058
l tried on that ring
after Curzon died.

680
00:37:36,096 --> 00:37:38,894
lt just slipped off my finger.

681
00:37:40,868 --> 00:37:45,669
lf you don't help me, old man,
they're going to take you

682
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:48,539
because l don't know
any more arguments.

683
00:37:50,377 --> 00:37:52,174
Then allow it to happen.

684
00:37:52,212 --> 00:37:55,238
lt is my obligation
to protect the lives

685
00:37:55,282 --> 00:37:57,045
of those in my command.

686
00:37:57,084 --> 00:37:58,642
You ought to know that,
you taught it to me.

687
00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:02,548
That was Curzon.

688
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:04,454
l'll stop trying to protect you

689
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,857
the minute you tell me
Curzon was guilty

690
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,018
of these charges.

691
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:09,825
l won't discuss it with you.

692
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:12,093
As for Enina Tandro

693
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:17,695
yes, l feel the shame
of Curzon's indiscretion.

694
00:38:17,738 --> 00:38:21,037
When one of my kind
stumbles, Benjamin

695
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:23,543
it is a mistake
that's there forever.

696
00:38:23,577 --> 00:38:26,637
l can't tell you
which part of Curzon Dax

697
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,979
couldn't stop himself
from acting shamefully

698
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,882
with another man's wife.

699
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:38,051
l can tell you...
that he did love her

700
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:40,219
for whatever that's worth.

701
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,626
Enough to kill her husband?

702
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,298
So you are questioning?

703
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:49,564
What else can l do?

704
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:53,339
Nothing, Benjamin.

705
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,307
Nothing at all.

706
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:15,491
Lieutenant Dax, you are either
200 years older than l am

707
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:19,590
or you're about the same age
as my great-granddaughter.

708
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:22,534
At first, l wondered
which of those you were.

709
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,732
Now, l am bothered
by the likelihood

710
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:27,706
that you may be both.

711
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:32,407
Let's finish this, Commander.

712
00:39:33,947 --> 00:39:36,211
At what age did the host,
Jadzia

713
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,718
first want to be joined
as a Trill?

714
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,050
l wanted it since l was a child.

715
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,521
l worked very hard for it.

716
00:39:42,556 --> 00:39:45,719
The competition to become
a Trill is very strong, then

717
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,056
among potential hosts?

718
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,790
Yes. lt's considered
a great honor.

719
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,890
How did the young Jadzia finally
become a host candidate?

720
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:54,661
By winning scholarships

721
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:57,067
competing against
other young people.

722
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:58,901
You're tested in countless ways.

723
00:39:59,006 --> 00:40:00,303
lncluding psychological tests

724
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,898
to determine strength
of character

725
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,705
of the prospective host,
is that true?

726
00:40:03,744 --> 00:40:04,733
Yes.

727
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,150
And the young Jadzia

728
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:10,720
excelled in those tests
of academics and character--

729
00:40:10,754 --> 00:40:13,018
of psychological stability.

730
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:15,184
Yes.

731
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:20,721
lf you can remember other
things, remember that as well.

732
00:40:20,764 --> 00:40:26,566
What academic degrees
do you hold, Lieutenant?

733
00:40:26,604 --> 00:40:32,065
l hold Premier Distinctions
in exobiology, zoology

734
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:35,738
astrophysics and exoarchaeology.

735
00:40:35,779 --> 00:40:37,644
How many of those degrees
did you earn

736
00:40:37,681 --> 00:40:39,911
before being joined
with the symbiont Dax?

737
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,248
All of them.

738
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:46,689
All of them.
As Jadzia.

739
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:47,952
Alone.

740
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:53,689
This brilliant and independent
young woman

741
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:57,792
has done nothing in her life
but contribute to her society.

742
00:40:57,835 --> 00:40:59,029
Madam Arbiter

743
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:01,264
how can anyone justify
trying her for a crime

744
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:03,102
allegedly committed
by another entity

745
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,108
before she was even born?

746
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:10,407
This will only take a minute.

747
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:13,550
Lieutenant...

748
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:14,881
as a Trill candidate

749
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:18,285
did Jadzia fully understand
the responsibilities

750
00:41:18,322 --> 00:41:21,052
to be assumed
upon becoming a Trill

751
00:41:21,091 --> 00:41:22,854
and did you willingly
accept those responsibilities

752
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:25,453
and whatever consequences
they might entail?

753
00:41:25,496 --> 00:41:27,225
Yes.

754
00:41:27,264 --> 00:41:30,165
And would that not obviously
include the consequences

755
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,998
of criminal acts
committed by Curzon Dax?

756
00:41:43,981 --> 00:41:46,313
May l speak?

757
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,113
And you are?

758
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:51,178
l am Enina Tandro

759
00:41:51,221 --> 00:41:54,520
widow of General Ardelon Tandro.

760
00:41:54,558 --> 00:41:57,026
This hearing is unnecessary.

761
00:41:57,061 --> 00:41:58,926
The accusations are erroneous.

762
00:41:59,029 --> 00:42:01,429
Mother, what are you
talking about?

763
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:06,164
Madam Arbiter,
Curzon Dax is accused

764
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:09,036
of sending a transmission
to the enemy

765
00:42:09,073 --> 00:42:12,372
that betrayed my husband.

766
00:42:12,409 --> 00:42:15,037
But l know where Curzon was

767
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:18,412
at the exact time
that transmission was sent.

768
00:42:22,086 --> 00:42:26,352
He was... in my bed.

769
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:46,906
Mr. Tandro

770
00:42:46,944 --> 00:42:50,846
you will want to reexamine
your extradition request.

771
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:55,716
Until then,
this hearing is adjourned.

772
00:43:07,898 --> 00:43:12,858
lt was kind of you
to try and protect me...

773
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:15,371
someone you'd never even met.

774
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:19,035
There's much of Curzon
that's still a part of me--

775
00:43:19,076 --> 00:43:22,204
that still remembers
what you had together.

776
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:26,546
But it was Curzon Dax
who swore himself to silence

777
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:31,043
to preserve the memory
of General Tandro, not Jadzia.

778
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:34,387
l felt it was important
to keep that promise.

779
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:38,885
The General's memory
is cherished by your people.

780
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:42,160
And it will continue to be.

781
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:43,666
Oh, no one will ever know

782
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,158
that he was the one
who tried to betray us

783
00:43:47,204 --> 00:43:50,264
and that the rebels
killed him for the favor.

784
00:43:53,043 --> 00:43:58,845
As for you, there is
one favor l would ask.

785
00:43:58,882 --> 00:44:01,851
Of course.

786
00:44:01,885 --> 00:44:04,718
Live, Jadzia Dax.

787
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:16,524
Live a long,
fresh and wonderful life.
