1
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:13,504
Look, save your energy.

2
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:17,167
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

3
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:19,200
l hope.

4
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:24,379
Try rerouting
the power coupling.

5
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,778
Mr. O'Brien.

6
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,289
See if you can activate
the interlock servos.

7
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,951
Mr. O'Brien.

8
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,723
Captain Jaheel, those people
have been stuck in that air lock

9
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:38,889
for over an hour.

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,091
Now, if you can wait
till we get that door opened

11
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,567
l'll be happy to listen
to any problems you might have.

12
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:45,194
But l've already
been waiting two days

13
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:46,464
for your people to readjust

14
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,063
my ship's antimatter
flow converter.

15
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:49,801
l'm afraid we've
gotten a little behind

16
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,103
in our maintenance schedule.

17
00:00:51,143 --> 00:00:52,804
l'm not interested
in hearing excuses.

18
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,641
l have a shipment
of Tamen Sahsheer

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,477
waiting to be
delivered to Largo V

20
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,676
and l'll need to do
better than warp 1

21
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:00,309
to get there
before it spoils.

22
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,946
l'll try to get a repair crew
to you by the end of the day.

23
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:05,752
Now, that's
the best l can do.

24
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,555
Your best, Mr. O'Brien,
hardly seems good enough.

25
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:13,158
Dax to O'Brien.

26
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:14,698
O'Brien here.

27
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,792
Can you spare a minute, Chief?

28
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:19,736
l have a little problem
here at the lab.

29
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,864
On my way.

30
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:29,704
Thanks for coming, Chief.

31
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:31,841
What are you doing out here?

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,715
Have you checked
the EPS converter?

33
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,192
Yes-- first thing.

34
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,887
How about the intensity grid?

35
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,021
lt's fine.

36
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,759
Then it's probably the secondary
phase modulator.

37
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,664
We had trouble
with them last week

38
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,066
in the main power core.

39
00:01:53,038 --> 00:01:54,562
That should do it.

40
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:02,109
Anything else
l can do for you?

41
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:05,706
The navigational computer

42
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,049
hasn't worked reliably
for three days.

43
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,112
l ask for the star charts
for the Argosian sector

44
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:13,147
Glessene sector
comes up instead.

45
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:16,160
That's when l can coax
this system on line.

46
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:17,559
Uh-huh.

47
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,621
Try it now.

48
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:24,695
Ah! That's more like it.

49
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,743
You look like you
could use some sleep.

50
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,180
Who has time for sleep?

51
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:41,743
l'd settle for five minutes
peace and quiet.

52
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,184
Chief, l thought you were going

53
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:48,624
to fix the replicators.

54
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,890
You're absolutely right, sir.

55
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:52,863
l knew l'd
forgotten something.

56
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:54,729
Can't have the
Operations Chief

57
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,063
sitting around daydreaming

58
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:58,763
when there's work
to be done, can we?

59
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,534
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
l'll get right on it.

60
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:04,667
''Fix the replicators, Chief.''

61
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,939
''My console's off-line, Chief.''

62
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,846
l should have transferred
to a cargo drone--

63
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:13,180
no people, no complaints.

64
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:56,121
Hot coffee--
black, double sweet.

65
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,267
Tell me, Quark.

66
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,765
Am l mistaken, or is business
a little slow today?

67
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,108
Slow? lt's been
almost nonexistent

68
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:37,909
for the past three days.

69
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:39,108
Mmm. Who knows?

70
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:40,774
lf things don't improve

71
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,911
you may be forced
to close down.

72
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:45,012
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

73
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:48,354
Well, let's just say,
without you around

74
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:50,860
my job would be
considerably easier.

75
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:53,362
Without me around,
you'd be forced

76
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:56,628
to find some other poor
innocent to persecute.

77
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,135
Think about that
while you sit here

78
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,966
gloating at my misfortune.

79
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:02,336
Quark!

80
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:04,739
You call this Kohlanese stew?

81
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:12,341
lf your meal
isn't satisfactory

82
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,079
l'm sure we could,
uh, exchange it

83
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,485
for something
more to your liking.

84
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,081
Aren't you the
least bit curious

85
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:22,216
as to how it tastes?

86
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:27,457
Ugh! Ugh!

87
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:29,022
Now...

88
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,533
you served it.

89
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,057
You're going to eat it.

90
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:33,763
All right, that's enough.

91
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:35,396
l said, eat it!

92
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:40,542
l said...

93
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,204
that's enough.

94
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:43,907
Leave him alone.

95
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:52,755
Well,
another satisfied customer.

96
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,724
lt's these replicators.

97
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:58,626
lf l don't get them fixed soon,
they'll destroy my business.

98
00:07:58,662 --> 00:08:01,096
Why not get O'Brien
to fix them?

99
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:04,225
He has the replicators on the
command level working perfectly.

100
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:06,668
l'm on his waiting list.

101
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:10,071
He assures me he'll get to them
as soon as he can.

102
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:11,506
Mmm...

103
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:14,067
No telling when that will be.

104
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:16,612
The Chief's a very busy man.

105
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:23,646
Computer...

106
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:26,087
display a station layout.

107
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:30,456
Highlight locations
of all repaired replicators

108
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:32,359
on command level.

109
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:34,227
lnformation restricted

110
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,755
to security clearance 5
and above.

111
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,461
Please enter
security verification.

112
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:56,483
Clearance verified.

113
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,755
There you go, sir.

114
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,927
l think you'll find that
more to your liking.

115
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,369
Very much appreciated,
Mr. O'Brien.

116
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:16,338
Don't mention it, sir.

117
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:18,705
Unfortunately, there
are plenty of replicators

118
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:20,505
around the station
that still need looking after.

119
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:23,479
You all right, Chief?

120
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:25,175
l'm just a bit hot.

121
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:27,046
The environmental controls

122
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:28,176
must be acting up again.

123
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:29,708
Send my regards
to Mrs. O'Brien.

124
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,584
Jake tells me
she's a wonderful teacher.

125
00:09:31,622 --> 00:09:32,953
Oh, that's nice to hear, sir.

126
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,924
She's flower units
about the lad herself.

127
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,357
Excuse me?

128
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:37,758
Sir?

129
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:39,820
What was that
you just said?

130
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:44,391
She's... quite fond
of the lad herself.

131
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:45,867
Oh.

132
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:47,393
l'm glad to hear it.

133
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:49,428
Very good, sir.

134
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:58,810
Ladies.

135
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,113
Hello, Lieutenant.

136
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,915
Oh, l forgot
how different it was.

137
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:05,854
How different what was?

138
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:07,413
Being female.

139
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:10,051
l haven't been one
for over 80 years.

140
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:12,118
All this attention.

141
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,357
lmagine it must take
some getting used to.

142
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,127
Actually,
l find it quite enjoyable.

143
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,531
Major Kira.

144
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:19,001
Lieutenant Dax.

145
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:22,130
l'd be honored to have you
join my little party--

146
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,900
as my guests, of course.

147
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:25,602
What's all this, Quark?

148
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:28,236
You cheat your
1,000th customer?

149
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:31,076
Who says Bajorans
don't have a sense of humor?

150
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:33,947
Actually, uh, we're
celebrating the repair

151
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:36,452
of the bar's
replicator system.

152
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:39,785
Perhaps l could interest you

153
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:43,725
in a nice, double-whipped,
l'danian spice pudding.

154
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,694
Oh, what do you think?

155
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,822
l think l'm due back at Ops

156
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:49,332
but, uh, go on.

157
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:50,833
Enjoy yourself.

158
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:03,913
Chief?

159
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:06,142
How can l help you, Major?

160
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:11,343
Looks like you're the one
who could use a little help.

161
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:13,913
Oh, no, l'm fine, really.

162
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,759
l suppose this isn't
a good time to tell you

163
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:22,560
that number three turbolift
has broken down again.

164
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:28,896
Joking, Chief.

165
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,670
Major, lark's true pepper.

166
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,040
What?

167
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:39,039
Let birds go
further loose maybe.

168
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,814
Shout easy play.

169
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:44,878
Chief, you're not
making any sense.

170
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:47,083
Round the turbulent quick.

171
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,524
Well, close
the reverse harbor.

172
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,660
A-Ankle try sound.

173
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,797
Reset gleaming.

174
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,542
Dinner to bug.

175
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:11,404
Chief, wait.

176
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:13,075
When?

177
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:14,447
Chief.

178
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,630
Computer,
continue neural imaging scan

179
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,999
and stimulate visual cortex.

180
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:35,561
All visual responses normal.

181
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:42,335
Begin auditory stimuli.

182
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,904
No physiological damage.

183
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:48,475
All brain functions
within normal parameters.

184
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,485
Nurse.

185
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,816
Yes?

186
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,412
Will you pull up Mr. O'Brien's

187
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:54,321
neurophysiological
history, please?

188
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,347
Yes, Doctor.

189
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,307
What is that?

190
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:05,740
What's he written?

191
00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:06,868
l wish l knew.

192
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,003
Strike limits

193
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:11,037
flame the dark true salt.

194
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,049
Please, Chief, take a seat.

195
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,550
Way link complete.

196
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,245
Way link!

197
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:20,549
What's wrong with him?

198
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,058
He appears to suffering
from a form of aphasia.

199
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,060
lt's a perceptual
dysfunction

200
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,494
in which aural
and visual stimuli

201
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,191
are incorrectly processed
by the brain.

202
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:30,290
His actual thinking
hasn't been affected

203
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:32,700
but he's incapable
of expressing himself

204
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:34,727
or understanding others.

205
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:38,730
Victory strike
limits frosted wake.

206
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:43,075
Simple hesitation.

207
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:45,410
l'm not sure l follow you,
Doctor.

208
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,541
You say Mr. O'Brien is aphasiac

209
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,175
but all of his tests
have come up negative.

210
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:50,550
lsn't aphasia

211
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:51,645
typically associated

212
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:53,485
with some kind
of cranial trauma?

213
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,718
Yes. lt can occur
as a result of a stroke

214
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:56,919
or a blow to the head

215
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,951
but there's no evidence
of that here.

216
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:00,257
Did you check
the medical library

217
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,264
for any precedents?

218
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,461
And rechecked--
nothing, so far.

219
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:05,934
You have any theories?

220
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,436
Not yet.

221
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,234
Find one.

222
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:11,706
Major Kira, get ahold of
the Chief's personal duty log.

223
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:13,039
l want to know where he's been

224
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,975
and what he's done
for the past 52 hours.

225
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:16,638
l've already examined it,
Commander.

226
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,170
He's been
all over this station.

227
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:21,548
Retrace his steps
and see what you come up with.

228
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:25,544
Dax, you will temporarily assume
Mr. O'Brien's duties.

229
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:27,216
Yes, uh... um...

230
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:29,885
ls there a problem, Lieutenant?

231
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:32,554
Lieutenant?

232
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:35,565
l'm sorry, Benjamin.

233
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:38,898
l'm unable to...

234
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:42,564
foolish assembled regal...

235
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:44,597
control weather.

236
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:57,417
Spontaneous development
of aphasia

237
00:14:57,454 --> 00:14:59,081
is virtually impossible.

238
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:02,888
Yet we saw Lieutenant Dax
become aphasiac before our eyes.

239
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:05,486
This told me we were
dealing with a disease

240
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,020
which only mimics aphasia,
so l ran a full

241
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:10,565
neural synaptic comparison
between Dax and O'Brien

242
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,364
and l found this in the
temporal lobes of both patients.

243
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:14,529
A virus.

244
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:15,868
lt imposes itself

245
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:18,033
within the established
synaptic pathways

246
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:19,769
and then randomly
reroutes them.

247
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,540
For example, when l look at this

248
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:24,877
a process occurs within my brain

249
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:27,713
which connects the stimulus
to the word ''tricorder.''

250
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:29,719
This virus
disrupts that process.

251
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,721
l'd see a tricorder

252
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:35,020
but l'd say something
ridiculous, like ''window.''

253
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,218
Exactly.

254
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,625
Doctor, l think
you should get over here.

255
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:40,220
Night the flow trade again.

256
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:41,355
You lost pile luck.

257
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,025
Away tunnel back the garden.

258
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:44,431
Doctor, l want this station

259
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:46,766
put under emergency
quarantine immediately.

260
00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:48,532
Yes, sir.

261
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,571
Dabo!

262
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:07,615
Quark,
what is going on here?

263
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:09,625
What does it look like?

264
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:11,957
lt looks like
business as usual

265
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:13,292
but that's impossible

266
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,298
because all shops
and businesses

267
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:17,630
have been closed
until further notice.

268
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:20,795
Except, of course, for
essential station operations.

269
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:22,600
For which this place
hardly qualifies.

270
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,129
l don't think they'd agree.

271
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:27,041
This quarantine has everybody
on edge, Constable.

272
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:30,410
Would you deprive them
of a little harmless diversion?

273
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:37,713
They'd be safer
in their quarters.

274
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:41,884
Quark, this Kohlian stew--
magnificent.

275
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:46,589
Fortunately, my assistant, Rom,
was able to fix the replicators.

276
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:52,665
Yes, very fortunate.

277
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:10,552
Jake...

278
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:13,215
l expected you
home an hour ago.

279
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:14,985
Sorry. l was at Nog's.

280
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,890
Dad, about this quarantine--

281
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:19,225
it's going
to be okay, isn't it?

282
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:21,025
lt's just a precaution,
nothing more.

283
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:23,395
l wish l shared your
confidence, Commander.

284
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,025
Go straight home, son.

285
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:27,035
l'll see you at dinner.

286
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:29,003
Captain Jaheel, all visitors

287
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,030
have been confined
to their ships.

288
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:33,041
Believe me, there is
no place l'd rather be.

289
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:34,770
Then what
are you doing here?

290
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,938
Commander, l officially
request permission

291
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,140
to leave this station.

292
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:39,148
Request denied.

293
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:40,308
But none of my crew

294
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,284
has been affected
by this virus of yours.

295
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,219
And, unless l depart at once

296
00:17:44,254 --> 00:17:46,313
my whole cargo will be ruined.

297
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:51,055
Captain, l suggest
you return to your ship now.

298
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:56,326
Please. l don't want
to get sick.

299
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:00,826
l'm sorry, but until we can
find a cure for this... thing

300
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,770
no one's going anywhere.

301
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:32,193
Computer, let's start with
one Ferengi starduster, please.

302
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:33,896
Extra strong.

303
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,042
Perfect.

304
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,048
Uh...

305
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:51,713
l thought the front wheels
were sticking a bit.

306
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,347
Unauthorized access

307
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,915
to crew quarters
is a crime, Quark.

308
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:59,360
You could have just asked
to use the replicators.

309
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:03,958
There's an old Ferengi saying--
''Never ask when you can take.''

310
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,730
Uh, how did you figure it out?

311
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,933
You claimed Rom
fixed your replicators.

312
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:11,838
-So?
-Rom's an idiot.

313
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,503
He couldn't fix a straw
if it was bent.

314
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:16,535
You're right.

315
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:17,773
Rom is an idiot.

316
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:21,272
Remind me to get rid
of him tomorrow.

317
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,316
Based on the levels of the virus
found in the patients' blood

318
00:19:26,356 --> 00:19:28,483
l believe it's being
absorbed through ingestion.

319
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:29,890
You're saying
it's in our food?

320
00:19:29,926 --> 00:19:31,018
Well, that's not possible.

321
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:33,255
All the food on this station
is replicated

322
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:35,355
and all the replicators
use biofilters.

323
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,593
They automatically
screen out contaminants

324
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,931
including viruses.

325
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:40,902
Major, l've analyzed
samples from replicators

326
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:42,234
all over the station.

327
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:44,570
Food on the command level
is contaminated.

328
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:46,905
But all of us here have
eaten from those replicators.

329
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:48,570
How come we're not aphasic?

330
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:50,238
This virus
is highly adaptable.

331
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,577
lts incubation period

332
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:53,673
seems to vary
within each individual.

333
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:55,582
According to O'Brien's duty log

334
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:58,178
the last thing he did
before becoming aphasic

335
00:19:58,221 --> 00:20:00,378
was fix
the command level replicators.

336
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:03,708
Get a repair crew over there
to inspect the site.

337
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:05,375
Let's shut down
those replicators.

338
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,543
Maybe we'll be able
to limit further contamination.

339
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:09,212
l'm afraid that's
not going to do it, sir.

340
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:11,221
l've been getting
aphasic patients

341
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:12,882
from all over the station.

342
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:14,221
How is that possible?

343
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:15,589
You can thank Quark.

344
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:17,150
l caught him
using a replicator

345
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:18,958
in one of the vacant
crew quarters.

346
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:21,396
He was producing
his entire menu out of there.

347
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:26,032
lf this virus is present

348
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:29,903
within a large enough segment
of the population

349
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:32,136
it could mean...

350
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:34,235
What is it,
Doctor?

351
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:38,840
l just took an air sample.

352
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:40,976
The virus...

353
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:42,918
lt's mutated
into an airborne variety.

354
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:44,512
Which means...?

355
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:48,651
Which means the whole station
is infected.

356
00:20:57,268 --> 00:21:00,795
Station Log, Stardate 46423.7.

357
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:03,272
Nearly 60% of DS9's population

358
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:05,275
has now contracted
the aphasia virus.

359
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:07,675
We've initiated standard
quarantine procedures

360
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:09,509
and are advising
all incoming ships

361
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:12,539
to maintain their distance
from the station

362
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,107
until further notice.

363
00:21:33,304 --> 00:21:36,432
l found it in the replicator's
pattern generator.

364
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:39,204
O'Brien must have accidentally
triggered it

365
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:41,143
when he repaired the system.

366
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:42,975
According to Bashir,
it introduced

367
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:44,743
an anomalous programming
sequence

368
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:46,682
into the materialization
subroutine.

369
00:21:46,717 --> 00:21:48,241
ln effect, it built the virus

370
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:50,015
directly into
the replicated food

371
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:51,214
at a molecular level.

372
00:21:51,255 --> 00:21:54,019
So what we have here
is sabotage.

373
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:55,150
Cardassian sabotage.

374
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:56,159
How can you be sure?

375
00:21:56,193 --> 00:21:58,718
Has a diboridium core
for a power source.

376
00:21:58,763 --> 00:22:00,628
That is Cardassian
technology.

377
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:02,690
Bashir to Sisko.

378
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:04,360
Sisko here.

379
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:07,269
Commander, l think you'd better
get down here to the infirmary

380
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:08,772
as soon as possible.

381
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:10,137
On my way.

382
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,747
You wanted to see me, Doctor?

383
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:21,146
Jake?

384
00:22:21,185 --> 00:22:25,281
Left... become better...

385
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:29,350
control... entire hope.

386
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:33,555
We've converted
some empty crew quarters

387
00:22:33,598 --> 00:22:34,565
into a hospital ward.

388
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,793
He'll be well looked after.

389
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,698
l'll take him there myself.

390
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,032
Come on, Jake.

391
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,901
You're going to be all right.

392
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:43,634
Commander, when
you've got a moment

393
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:46,507
l've found something
l'd like to show you.

394
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:53,416
lt'll be all right.
Just lay back.

395
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:57,080
l know, but just
lay back and relax.

396
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,991
Food... dabo... drinks...

397
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:05,655
money... hand... mine... give!

398
00:23:05,696 --> 00:23:07,493
Well, Quark, l see even you

399
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:09,999
couldn't weasel your
way clear of this one.

400
00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:12,832
You underestimate the Ferengi
immune system, Commander.

401
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,430
l'm merely here visiting
my less fortunate customers

402
00:23:15,473 --> 00:23:17,600
to make sure they're
not faking the illness

403
00:23:17,642 --> 00:23:19,007
to avoid paying their bills.

404
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,975
No one could
be that devious.

405
00:23:21,012 --> 00:23:22,639
l am.

406
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,740
You... gold... owe... me!

407
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:33,011
l... now... give!

408
00:23:33,124 --> 00:23:34,489
Up.

409
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:39,057
We're doing
everything possible.

410
00:23:41,532 --> 00:23:44,865
l'll be back
as soon as l can.

411
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:54,137
The virus is synthetic,
Commander.

412
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:56,146
lts nucleotide sequence
is too perfect.

413
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,408
lt's clearly not natural.

414
00:23:57,448 --> 00:23:58,881
You're saying the Cardassians

415
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,611
genetically engineered
this thing?

416
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:02,380
Well, that's what
l thought at first

417
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,786
but l've studied Cardassian
genetic engineering.

418
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:06,255
They always
build distinctive

419
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,951
monoclonial links
into their DNA.

420
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:09,755
This virus has none
of those features.

421
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:10,988
All right,
then who made it?

422
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:12,653
Well, that's what
l wanted to find out.

423
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:15,427
So l referenced all known
DNA construction techniques

424
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:16,899
in the Federation records

425
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:18,993
and this protein
series was the key.

426
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:20,003
lt indicates...

427
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:22,562
Doctor!
Who created this virus?

428
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:23,595
The Bajorans, sir.

429
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:25,905
l believe it must have
been a terrorist plot

430
00:24:25,943 --> 00:24:28,605
to sabotage the Cardassians
while they were here.

431
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,644
The energy decay
of the power core

432
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:39,645
indicates it dates back
to the building of the station.

433
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,851
That's 18 years ago.

434
00:24:41,892 --> 00:24:43,689
l suppose
the Bajoran underground

435
00:24:43,728 --> 00:24:46,754
could have smuggled it aboard
during construction...

436
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:49,357
before l took over
as Head of Security.

437
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,028
But why would the underground
go to all the trouble

438
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:53,536
of planting a booby trap
and not set it off?

439
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:55,038
Maybe they forgot.

440
00:24:55,072 --> 00:24:57,632
No. More likely,
they were captured

441
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,610
or killed before
they could release it.

442
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,167
or killed before
they could release it.

443
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:03,476
We need to find out
who created this virus.

444
00:25:03,514 --> 00:25:04,981
You're our best hope.

445
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:08,815
18 years is a long time.

446
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:09,979
Besides, even if she

447
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:13,386
finds who did this, that's
no guarantee they can help us.

448
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:15,722
We just have to hope
they remember the antidote.

449
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,490
That's assuming they ever
bothered to create one.

450
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,535
lt had to be someone
in the underground

451
00:25:28,572 --> 00:25:30,199
familiar
with genetic engineering.

452
00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:31,731
18 years ago?

453
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:32,868
Sounds like something

454
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,639
Dekon Elig
might have thought up.

455
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:35,702
How can l find him?

456
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:38,510
The last l heard
he was in a Cardassian prison.

457
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:39,709
Where was he being held?

458
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,514
The Velos Vll lnternment Camp

459
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:45,021
but that was nine years ago.

460
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:48,751
And you have no idea
where he is now?

461
00:25:48,793 --> 00:25:52,024
Think, Galis.
This is important.

462
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:56,965
l'm sorry, Kira,
but it was all so long ago.

463
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,536
What is it, Jake?

464
00:26:03,574 --> 00:26:05,542
Roll linger when life...

465
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:07,203
roll linger when...

466
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:08,575
What?

467
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:18,680
Other support, strong courage...

468
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:26,559
He's running a high fever.

469
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:28,565
Open way long.

470
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,260
Open way.

471
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:34,700
Doctor, we have
an emergency in crew quarters.

472
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:50,520
How is he, Doctor?

473
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:52,021
Not good, l'm afraid.

474
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:55,025
The virus has attacked
his autonomic nervous system.

475
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:56,526
Can he be stabilized?

476
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,653
He hasn't responded
to neural stimulation.

477
00:26:58,696 --> 00:27:00,687
l've given him 30cc's
of corophizine

478
00:27:00,731 --> 00:27:02,289
to avoid secondary infection

479
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:05,063
but so far, l've been unable
to lower his fever.

480
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:06,694
What are his chances?

481
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:11,970
Unless l find some way
to counteract the virus

482
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,061
he'll be dead in 12 hours.

483
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:16,754
Have you made any progress?

484
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:18,264
No.

485
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:20,926
l've tried
base pair destabilizers

486
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:24,765
sequential disruption--
nothing seems to affect it.

487
00:27:24,805 --> 00:27:27,933
Sir, l've got seven
other aphasic patients

488
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:31,442
displaying the same symptoms
as O'Brien here

489
00:27:31,478 --> 00:27:34,606
and l'm afraid
this is only the beginning.

490
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:36,673
Keep searching, Doctor.

491
00:27:36,717 --> 00:27:38,344
l hope Major Kira finds

492
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:41,684
whoever's responsible
for creating this virus.

493
00:27:41,722 --> 00:27:44,282
l'd like to meet
that person myself.

494
00:27:44,324 --> 00:27:46,554
This virus
is a work of genius.

495
00:27:46,593 --> 00:27:48,993
l'll try to
arrange it for you.

496
00:27:59,573 --> 00:28:02,371
Link established with
the Bajoran Archival Records.

497
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:05,242
Locate files on Velos Vll
lnternment Camp.

498
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,371
Ready.

499
00:28:06,413 --> 00:28:08,779
Do you show a record
of an inmate named Dekon Elig?

500
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:10,407
Affirmative.

501
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,577
Biographical data.

502
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:14,644
Dekon Elig, geneticist.

503
00:28:14,688 --> 00:28:16,747
Former member
of the Higa Metar sect

504
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,451
of the Bajoran underground.

505
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:22,360
Killed while attempting escape,
Stardate 39355.

506
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:24,921
Certificate of Death on file.

507
00:28:24,998 --> 00:28:28,092
No need to ask
how you're doing.

508
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:29,659
Chasing after ghosts.

509
00:28:29,703 --> 00:28:31,500
You have 12 hours
to catch one.

510
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:33,199
And then?

511
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,901
People start dying.

512
00:28:41,014 --> 00:28:42,379
Computer...

513
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:47,481
display Dekon Elig's
Certificate of Death.

514
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:51,587
ldentify signature of witness.

515
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:54,958
Certificate of Death
was witnessed by Surmak Ren

516
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:57,826
Bajoran medical assistant.

517
00:28:57,864 --> 00:29:01,527
Show me biographical data
on Surmak Ren.

518
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,865
Dr. Surmak Ren.

519
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:05,633
Former member
of the Higa Metar sect

520
00:29:05,672 --> 00:29:07,435
of the Bajoran underground.

521
00:29:07,474 --> 00:29:09,669
Repatriated to Bajor
upon closing

522
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,511
of the Velos Vll lnternment
Camp, Stardate 46302.

523
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:16,413
Current status unknown.

524
00:29:28,962 --> 00:29:30,293
Dabo.

525
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,260
Any luck?

526
00:29:38,305 --> 00:29:41,866
l haven't won a spin in hours.

527
00:29:41,908 --> 00:29:44,502
Uh, care to place
a friendly wager?

528
00:29:44,544 --> 00:29:47,672
lf it's your reputation
you're thinking about

529
00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:49,545
no one need ever know.

530
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:53,519
lt has nothing to do
with my reputation.

531
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:58,281
The truth is, l never...

532
00:29:58,325 --> 00:30:00,156
learned the game.

533
00:30:00,193 --> 00:30:02,423
You mean, you've sat here
for all these years

534
00:30:02,462 --> 00:30:04,362
and you don't even
know how to gamble?

535
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:06,559
That's correct.

536
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,194
No wonder you
always look so bored.

537
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:12,694
The rules are quite
simple, actually.

538
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:14,832
l'd be happy to
show them to you.

539
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,105
Some other time, perhaps.

540
00:30:17,144 --> 00:30:18,771
Sisko needs me in Ops.

541
00:30:18,812 --> 00:30:21,178
And, since
the entire security force

542
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:23,375
has been stricken
with aphasia

543
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:26,386
the Promenade is in
a very vulnerable position.

544
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,820
How unfortunate.

545
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:33,916
Consider it a warning, Quark.

546
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,225
Because l'm holding you
personally responsible

547
00:30:37,264 --> 00:30:40,529
if anything turns up missing.

548
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,933
ls that understood?

549
00:30:42,969 --> 00:30:44,459
Perfectly.

550
00:30:44,504 --> 00:30:45,835
Hmm.

551
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:55,543
Dabo.

552
00:30:56,983 --> 00:31:00,646
Computer,
analyze test sample 37 delta.

553
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:03,121
Detail effects
on viral containment.

554
00:31:03,156 --> 00:31:05,249
Working. Analysis complete.

555
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:07,351
Sample 37 delta ineffective.

556
00:31:07,394 --> 00:31:11,353
Viral protein sheath
is unaffected.

557
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:14,299
Nucleotide sequence
remains intact.

558
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:19,772
Computer, replay morning.

559
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:21,103
Command unclear.

560
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:22,506
Please repeat.

561
00:31:26,246 --> 00:31:29,977
Glass lunch judge a bin
to let it.

562
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,710
Command unclear.

563
00:31:31,752 --> 00:31:33,242
Please repeat.

564
00:31:45,098 --> 00:31:49,728
Computer, establish a link
with the Bajoran Medical lndex

565
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,331
for the, uh,
Northwestern District.

566
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:55,000
Link established.

567
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:58,340
Access all information
on Dr. Surmak Ren.

568
00:31:58,378 --> 00:32:01,279
There are no records
matching that name.

569
00:32:01,314 --> 00:32:04,112
Try the Northeastern District--
same search.

570
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:06,619
Dr. Surmak Ren,
currently serving

571
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:10,487
as Chief Administrator
of the llvian Medical Complex.

572
00:32:10,524 --> 00:32:13,891
Computer, open a channel
to the llvian Medical Complex

573
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:16,919
Administrator's office.

574
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:19,932
This is Dr. Surmak.
And you are...?

575
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:21,524
Major Kira Nerys

576
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:23,729
Bajoran liaison to Deep Space 9.

577
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,466
Ah, yes, the old Cardassian
mining station.

578
00:32:26,506 --> 00:32:27,973
How can l help you?

579
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:29,305
lt depends.

580
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:30,639
On what?

581
00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:33,305
On whether or not
you helped Dekon Elig

582
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:36,144
plant an aphasia virus here
18 years ago.

583
00:32:36,183 --> 00:32:39,243
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

584
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:45,157
Look, Sisko, l'm a security
officer-- a good one--

585
00:32:45,192 --> 00:32:46,853
but that doesn't
make me qualified

586
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:48,656
to help you run
station operations.

587
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:50,560
You're probably right,
Constable.

588
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:52,997
But, as you can see,
you're all l've got.

589
00:32:53,033 --> 00:32:55,001
Commander...

590
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:58,163
Commander, l think
l found our scientist.

591
00:32:58,205 --> 00:32:59,672
Does he have an antidote?

592
00:32:59,706 --> 00:33:01,173
l don't know.
He broke the connection

593
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:02,607
the minute
l mentioned the virus.

594
00:33:02,642 --> 00:33:05,042
Major, you mind telling me
where you're going?

595
00:33:05,078 --> 00:33:08,411
To continue my conversation
with Dr. Surmak, in person.

596
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:11,144
Major, l can't allow you
to break quarantine.

597
00:33:11,184 --> 00:33:12,742
We can't risk
spreading the virus to Bajor.

598
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:14,083
l am well aware
of that, Commander.

599
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,587
As a matter of fact

600
00:33:15,622 --> 00:33:17,954
l don't intend
to step foot on the planet.

601
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:20,959
Better let her go, Sisko.

602
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:23,757
She's all we've got.

603
00:33:34,608 --> 00:33:36,667
Let's just hope
there's someone left

604
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,473
to greet her when she returns.

605
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:54,156
Jake.

606
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:57,396
How's it going?

607
00:34:10,777 --> 00:34:13,050
l've missed you.

608
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:16,414
l know things don't look
too good right now

609
00:34:16,453 --> 00:34:19,081
but they'll get better.

610
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,149
You have to believe that

611
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:26,060
because l'm not going
to lose you, Jake.

612
00:34:26,096 --> 00:34:28,189
You hear me?

613
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,564
l'm not going to lose you.

614
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:45,839
You better take a look at this.

615
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,511
We have activity
on Docking Port 5.

616
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:50,850
l think a ship
is about to depart.

617
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,355
Docking Port 5?

618
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,856
That's Jaheel's ship.

619
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,381
Put him on screen.

620
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,327
Captain, your ship

621
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,889
has not been cleared
for departure.

622
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:04,092
The mooring clamps are locked

623
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:05,567
and l don't intend
to release them.

624
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:09,333
l suggest you change your mind.

625
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,739
l'm taking aft thrusters
to one half.

626
00:35:14,778 --> 00:35:16,575
Captain, cut your engines

627
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:18,843
before you rip
your ship apart.

628
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:20,850
He's not reducing power.

629
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:24,581
Jaheel, l'm ordering
you to stand down.

630
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:27,021
Your orders
are no concern of mine.

631
00:35:27,057 --> 00:35:29,787
My entire crew has been
confined to your hospital.

632
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:33,023
l must leave now,
while l can still function.

633
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:35,031
Look, l understand
that you're frightened

634
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:36,930
but, believe me,
you're better off here.

635
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,729
You don't want
to be out there alone

636
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:39,929
and get hit by the virus.

637
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:43,370
Don't worry about me,
l'm fine.

638
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,875
And l plan to stay that way.

639
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:47,467
And if you think you're go...

640
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:51,838
We'll have to
retract the clamps.

641
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:53,941
Once he's clear
of the station

642
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,679
we can grab him
with a tractor beam.

643
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:03,125
Damn.

644
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,627
What's wrong?

645
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:06,652
There's too much stress
on the mooring clamps.

646
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,255
They're not retracting.

647
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,236
His aft isolation
plate buckled.

648
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:18,707
His main power core's
been ruptured.

649
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:20,903
lf the internal
fuel cells collapse

650
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,774
the whole ship will explode.

651
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,407
And take half
the docking ring with it.

652
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:37,619
Computer, isolate a com line

653
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:41,119
to the llvian Medical Complex
Administrator's office.

654
00:36:41,164 --> 00:36:42,791
Line isolated.

655
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,801
Scan office for life-forms.

656
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,303
One life-form present.

657
00:36:47,337 --> 00:36:51,000
Lock on
and stand by to transport.

658
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:53,636
This is Dr. Surmak.

659
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:55,508
Hello again, Doctor.

660
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:57,479
Just checking
to see you're in your office.

661
00:36:57,514 --> 00:36:59,505
l have nothing to say to...

662
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,188
Hello again, Doctor.

663
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:10,693
This is outrageous.

664
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:12,319
l demand you return me

665
00:37:12,362 --> 00:37:14,159
to my office immediately.

666
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:15,391
Relax, Doctor.

667
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:17,024
You won't be gone long.

668
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,139
Try to reestablish
visual contact

669
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:25,334
with Jaheel's ship.

670
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:28,401
No response.

671
00:37:28,445 --> 00:37:29,912
His com lines are down.

672
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:32,880
Bypass communications
through a secondary grid.

673
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,578
See if you can switch
to external pickups.

674
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:36,950
Got it.

675
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:42,814
His fire control systems
don't appear to be working.

676
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:44,918
We have about 15 minutes

677
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:47,792
before the fuel cells collapse.

678
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:50,800
l hope you feel better
than you look.

679
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:52,699
Must be that damn virus.

680
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:54,203
This is Sisko.

681
00:37:54,237 --> 00:37:56,933
Any station personnel
who can understand

682
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:59,669
what l'm saying, come
to Ops immediately.

683
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,177
We need help up here.

684
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:03,702
We have to get that ship
away from the station.

685
00:38:03,747 --> 00:38:05,715
Why don't we explode
the mooring clamps?

686
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:08,582
The blast should push the ship
away from the docking ring.

687
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:12,679
We'll have to get down there
and blow it manually.

688
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,350
l'll do it.

689
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,859
All right.

690
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:18,861
You can cross barrels.

691
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:21,056
All job appalled.

692
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,623
What was that?

693
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,897
Bread...

694
00:38:26,002 --> 00:38:27,594
the arrive...

695
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:30,071
seen earlier.

696
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:34,168
Oh, l see.

697
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,511
Major, this is kidnapping.

698
00:38:44,554 --> 00:38:47,489
Turn this ship around or,
l swear, you will spend

699
00:38:47,524 --> 00:38:50,084
the rest of your life
in Kran-Tobol Prison.

700
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,789
Fine. But first,
we need your help.

701
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:55,923
The aphasia virus is spreading
through the station.

702
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,558
Why come to me?

703
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,660
You helped create the virus,
didn't you?

704
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:01,637
No, l had practically
nothing to do with it.

705
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:03,639
Dekon Elig created the virus.

706
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:05,800
l was merely
his medical assistant.

707
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:07,867
That seems
like a lifetime ago now.

708
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:10,402
l was only in the underground
for six months

709
00:39:10,447 --> 00:39:12,074
before we were captured.

710
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:14,083
l am not responsible for this.

711
00:39:14,117 --> 00:39:16,278
l am not looking to place blame!

712
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:18,082
All l want is the antidote.

713
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,351
l don't know of any antidote.

714
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,188
lf Dekon created one,
he never told me.

715
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:24,693
Listen, Surmak.

716
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:27,526
l have a station
full of dying people

717
00:39:27,564 --> 00:39:29,464
and you are
the closest thing there is

718
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:30,898
to an expert on this virus.

719
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:32,491
l sympathize, Major

720
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,902
but l don't think
l can help you.

721
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:36,905
All right.

722
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:40,841
Then how about helping yourself?

723
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:42,435
Meaning what?

724
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,504
Meaning...

725
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,314
l've been infected
with your virus, Doctor

726
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:52,685
so now you're infected, too.

727
00:39:57,861 --> 00:40:00,625
To anyone who can hear me,
this is Odo.

728
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:01,926
Sisko's infected.

729
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:04,660
l could really use
some help here in Ops.

730
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:07,499
Do l detect a note
of panic in your voice?

731
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:09,061
Quark.

732
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:12,939
Am l to believe that you're
volunteering to help?

733
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:15,501
Who said anything
about volunteering?

734
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:17,843
We can haggle over price later.

735
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:19,644
Now, um...

736
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:22,811
how may l be of use?

737
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,048
l need to get
to Docking Port 5 now.

738
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,522
That ship's going to explode
in five minutes.

739
00:40:27,557 --> 00:40:29,320
l'll beam you over.

740
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,485
You?

741
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:31,789
Relax.

742
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:34,194
l served on a
Ferengi freighter

743
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,597
for eight years.

744
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:37,691
All right.

745
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:40,066
l must have witnessed
the procedure

746
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:41,365
hundreds of times.

747
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:42,598
Witnessed?

748
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,199
You mean to say you never
handled the controls yourself?

749
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:47,740
Energizing.

750
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:09,392
Kira to Ops.
Approaching Landing Pad 7.

751
00:41:09,436 --> 00:41:12,769
Request clearance
to initiate docking procedure.

752
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:14,797
Welcome back.
l could use some help up here.

753
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:16,331
Quark, what are you

754
00:41:16,376 --> 00:41:18,367
doing in Ops?

755
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:25,281
First thing l need to see

756
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:28,481
is your doctor's viral
characterization research.

757
00:41:31,558 --> 00:41:33,458
He was beginning to develop
an antidote series.

758
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:34,585
Let's take a look at that.

759
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:36,755
Listen, Doctor, um

760
00:41:36,796 --> 00:41:37,922
l'll be in Ops.

761
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:40,761
lf you need me,
use this string impact.

762
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,030
Lot show red intense.

763
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:47,099
l think you'd better
sit down, Major.

764
00:42:06,526 --> 00:42:08,892
Dog fellow distance.

765
00:42:08,962 --> 00:42:10,589
Yeah, tell me about it.

766
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,030
Odo, you'd better hurry up.

767
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:15,432
That ship's going to explode
in one minute.

768
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:21,267
Virum protein sheath.

769
00:42:21,308 --> 00:42:23,173
Nucleotide sequence.

770
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:24,699
Yes.

771
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:26,211
That's right.

772
00:42:26,246 --> 00:42:28,680
lt's an adaptive,
synaptic inhibitor.

773
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,239
Dekon was brilliant.

774
00:42:30,283 --> 00:42:32,251
No doubt of that.

775
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:34,253
l think we've found

776
00:42:34,287 --> 00:42:36,118
your antidote, Major.

777
00:42:37,924 --> 00:42:39,915
40 seconds.

778
00:42:53,673 --> 00:42:55,163
30 seconds. Hurry!

779
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,472
l know, l know.

780
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:03,639
20 seconds!

781
00:43:09,122 --> 00:43:11,113
Ten seconds!

782
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:38,213
Odo? Quark to Odo.

783
00:43:38,251 --> 00:43:39,616
You still with us?

784
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:42,383
Try not to sound
too disappointed.

785
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:45,391
Now, about that little matter

786
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:47,256
of my hazard pay...

787
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:48,726
Why, you...

788
00:43:52,465 --> 00:43:54,797
Come on. Come on.

789
00:43:58,538 --> 00:44:02,497
Station Log, Stardate 46425.8.

790
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,601
With the help
of Dr. Bashir's notes

791
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:08,045
Dr. Surmak was able to find an
antidote for the aphasia virus.

792
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:11,346
We are continuing to administer
it throughout the station

793
00:44:11,384 --> 00:44:13,215
and things are slowly
returning to normal.

794
00:44:13,253 --> 00:44:15,551
Good to have you back, Chief.

795
00:44:15,588 --> 00:44:16,987
Thank you, sir.

796
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,513
Coffee, black.

797
00:44:25,265 --> 00:44:26,892
O'Brien!
