1
00:00:02,894 --> 00:00:04,725
So, there l was...

2
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:07,823
fighting the toughest battle
of my life...

3
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:10,926
looking around,
hoping to spot a friendly face

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,164
only to discover
my colleagues...

5
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:15,139
were gone.

6
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:16,572
l was alone.

7
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:19,600
l admit for a moment there
l considered giving up.

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,011
l could feel
the seconds ticking away--

9
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:23,878
panic building up
inside of me.

10
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:26,782
l knew my only chance
was to trust my instincts

11
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,547
so l closed my eyes...

12
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:31,147
took a deep breath

13
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:34,056
and just like that,
it came to me--

14
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:36,822
the answer l was looking for--

15
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:38,989
a pericardial membrane!

16
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:39,998
Oh!

17
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:41,363
l looked down

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,164
and punched the answer
into my computer terminal

19
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:46,830
just as the buzzer sounded,
ending the exam

20
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,362
and that, l suppose

21
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:51,501
is the stuff
salutatorians are made of.

22
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:53,204
Salutatorian?

23
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:58,181
Well, l mistook
a preganglionic fiber

24
00:00:58,216 --> 00:01:01,447
for a postganglionic nerve
during the orals

25
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:04,478
or l would have been
valedictorian.

26
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,150
lt was a trick question.

27
00:01:06,258 --> 00:01:07,589
Fascinating.

28
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:09,958
Not nearly as fascinating
as when l...

29
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:12,122
Dr. Bashir, Chief O'Brien.

30
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:15,622
Report to Landing Pad Five.

31
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,464
Bad timing.

32
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:19,732
There'll be another time.

33
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:28,405
Starfleet medical finals.

34
00:01:28,447 --> 00:01:30,210
Gets them every time.

35
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:35,176
lt's no use.

36
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:37,346
Chief!

37
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,583
We have to get
this hatch open.

38
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:40,853
Lieutenant Dax and Ensign Pauley
are trapped in there.

39
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,052
The runabout
barely made it back

40
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:43,186
through the wormhole.

41
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:44,489
By the time they docked

42
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:45,757
power levels were near zero.

43
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:47,321
There's not even enough juice
left in the ship

44
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,333
to release the servos.

45
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:49,527
Life support's down.

46
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,695
Oxygen levels have dropped
dangerously low.

47
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:52,795
Have to burn it through.

48
00:01:52,838 --> 00:01:53,805
Forget it, Major.

49
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,397
The hatch is made
of duranium composite.

50
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,067
lt'll take you an hour
to get through it.

51
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,076
We don't have that much time.

52
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,077
That's odd.

53
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:01,443
How many passengers did you say
were on board the <i>Ganges?</i>

54
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,447
Two.

55
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:03,448
l'm reading three.

56
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:05,245
We need to get power
to the hatch servos.

57
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:07,012
Major, hand me
the EPl capacitor.

58
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:08,952
There, middle shelf.

59
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:19,897
Try her now.

60
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:32,168
Dax?

61
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,235
l'm fine. Check the others.

62
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:39,773
Vash?

63
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:41,479
That's right.

64
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,717
Miles O'Brien,
from the <i>Enterprise.</i>

65
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,519
Oh. Yes, of course.

66
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,651
What are you doing
on the <i>Ganges?</i>

67
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:49,717
We found her

68
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,023
in the Gamma Quadrant.

69
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:53,189
She'd been there
for over two years.

70
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,822
Two years?!

71
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:56,629
Doctor, we'd better
get these people

72
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:57,828
over to the infirmary.

73
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,230
Right this way.

74
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:10,370
How did you get to the Gamma
Quadrant two years ago?

75
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:12,144
A friend dropped me off.

76
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:13,173
Oh.

77
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:22,568
Will l live?

78
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:24,235
You're fine.

79
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:26,710
ln fact...

80
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:28,736
you're in remarkable shape.

81
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:30,408
Thank you, Doctor.

82
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:31,848
l try.

83
00:05:31,884 --> 00:05:34,717
Well, l-l-l-l mean
you've, uh...

84
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:36,015
managed quite well

85
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:37,886
considering you've
been out of contact

86
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,754
with civilization
for over two years.

87
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:42,761
Well, l'd hardly call
the Gamma Quadrant uncivilized.

88
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:44,592
Some of the cultures
l've encountered

89
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,860
have histories dating back
millions of years.

90
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:50,062
Really? l'd love
to hear about them.

91
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:52,569
l mean, we have no idea
what's beyond the wormhole.

92
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:54,504
Well, maybe l'll write a book.

93
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,907
Well, it's sure to be a
best-seller around here.

94
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,934
l... well... um...

95
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:03,277
no sign of disease
or malnutrition

96
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:05,249
or parasitic infections.

97
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:07,582
You sound disappointed.

98
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:09,484
l am.

99
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:12,354
Now l have no reason
to keep you here.

100
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:16,725
Well, you almost make me wish
l wasn't feeling well.

101
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:28,638
And she claims she knew nothing
about the wormhole?

102
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:30,699
She did seem very surprised
when l told her about it.

103
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:32,209
l don't think she ever expected

104
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:34,007
to see this part
of the galaxy again.

105
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:35,673
How could she get there
in the first place

106
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:37,204
if she didn't go
through the wormhole?

107
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:40,309
She said she didn't
want to talk about it.

108
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:42,183
Said it was a personal matter.

109
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:43,552
This doesn't make sense--

110
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,921
a human alone in the Gamma
Quadrant for two years.

111
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,289
Let's check her background.

112
00:06:47,326 --> 00:06:49,055
See what we can
find out about her.

113
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:51,460
She claims to be
an archaeologist.

114
00:06:51,497 --> 00:06:53,590
That's a good place to start.

115
00:06:58,137 --> 00:07:00,435
You sure this place is safe?

116
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:01,803
The Assay Office

117
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,502
is the most secure
area on the station.

118
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:07,307
The chambers are
surrounded on all sides

119
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:09,177
by individual force fields.

120
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:11,307
And how are
the locks controlled?

121
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,285
Once you secure a chamber,
it can't be opened

122
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,220
except with your personal
authorization code

123
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:20,282
combined with a verified
retinal print.

124
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:22,486
A Cardassian MK-7 scanner?

125
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,018
MK-12.

126
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:26,962
With an L-90
enhanced resolution filter.

127
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:30,662
Well, l suppose
that will have to do.

128
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:36,902
Computer, begin inventory
for cubicle 19.

129
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:40,370
One statue...

130
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:42,039
stone.

131
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:47,245
30-odd centimeters tall,
approximately eight kilograms.

132
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:52,556
Assorted gems.

133
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:02,291
Gold necklace.

134
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,468
One dagger...

135
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:09,406
bronze and gold.

136
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:12,467
About 25 centimeters.

137
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,883
Beautiful.

138
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,910
l've never seen anything
quite like it.

139
00:08:22,955 --> 00:08:26,322
Some kind of Promethean quartz.

140
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:28,019
l thought so, too, at first

141
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:31,027
but its molecular density
and refraction index

142
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,028
is much higher.

143
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:33,997
Remarkable.

144
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:40,334
End inventory.

145
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:46,236
Please, enter an access code.

146
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:02,987
All right.

147
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:05,656
l'll be back tomorrow
to pick everything up.

148
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:07,790
l've booked passage
on the Mulzirak Transport.

149
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,495
You're not leaving us
so soon, are you?

150
00:09:10,535 --> 00:09:12,093
l'm afraid so.

151
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:19,738
The Daystrom lnstitute
will be very disappointed.

152
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:21,245
The Daystrom lnstitute?

153
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,406
Their scientists
are anxious

154
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:24,176
to hear about life
in the Gamma Quadrant.

155
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:26,446
Every place you've been,
everything you've seen

156
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:27,975
no matter
how insignificant

157
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,818
could prove to be important,
including how you got there.

158
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:33,188
Sorry, Commander,
but that's a...

159
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:34,715
Personal matter.
...personal matter.

160
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:42,729
So now the Daystrom
lnstitute is interested in me.

161
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:43,996
Well, that's ironic.

162
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:46,266
Professor Woo
seemed especially eager

163
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:47,670
to speak to you again.

164
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:48,673
Did he really?

165
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:50,971
l suppose he told you
he suspended my membership

166
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,136
from the lnstitute's
Archaeological Council?

167
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:54,145
On two occasions.

168
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,306
Something about the sale
of illegal artifacts.

169
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:57,906
Well, when it
comes to choosing

170
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:59,280
between science and profit

171
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:00,876
l'll choose profit every time.

172
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,683
The professor was hoping you'd
make an exception in this case.

173
00:10:03,722 --> 00:10:06,850
You know, l haven't
been back to Earth in...

174
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:08,291
it must be 12 years.

175
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:09,624
Here's your chance.

176
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:11,526
l could arrange passage.

177
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:14,623
l think l'd like that.

178
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,998
Fine. l'll take care of it.

179
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,679
l don't understand it,
Commander.

180
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:31,910
l can't find anything
wrong with her.

181
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,783
This ship is
completely functional.

182
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,447
lt didn't look that way
this morning.

183
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:38,217
Oh, don't get me wrong.

184
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:40,019
The power reserves are empty.

185
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:42,652
The inertial damping fields
are barely operational

186
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:44,355
and the warp drive
containment field's

187
00:10:44,396 --> 00:10:45,761
on the verge of collapse.

188
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:46,855
But?

189
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:49,093
But there's nothing
wrong with any of them.

190
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:50,999
Once we put power back into her

191
00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:53,027
she should be fully operational.

192
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:55,096
Did you check the central
power linkages?

193
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:56,265
Yes, sir.

194
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:58,003
l ran a level-1 diagnostic.

195
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,305
Everything checks out.

196
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:00,811
l can't explain it.

197
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:03,940
lt's like something
tapped into the ship's systems

198
00:11:03,982 --> 00:11:05,574
and drained them dry.

199
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,490
Tell me, Chief, how well
do you know this woman Vash?

200
00:11:14,526 --> 00:11:15,493
Hardly at all.

201
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:16,721
Only met her that one time

202
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:18,059
she was aboard the <i>Enterprise.</i>

203
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:19,222
What was she doing there?

204
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:22,597
Well, sir,
Vash and Captain Picard

205
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:23,658
were friends--

206
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:26,170
close friends,
if you follow my meaning.

207
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:29,435
Seems they met on Risa
a few years back.

208
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:30,668
l figure she must be
a special woman

209
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,677
being friends with
the Captain and all.

210
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:34,645
Somehow, she doesn't seem
to be his type.

211
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,843
Well, the Captain likes
a good challenge, sir.

212
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:48,991
Status report?

213
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:51,655
We suffered
a broad-spectrum power drain.

214
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:53,561
Power transfer is
completely inoperative.

215
00:11:53,598 --> 00:11:54,656
The energy was drawn out

216
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:55,961
faster than it could handle.

217
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:57,662
l'll have to replace
the whole unit.

218
00:11:57,702 --> 00:12:00,535
Chief, are you reading
any graviton flux

219
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:02,665
around the transfer systems?

220
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:04,937
l am detecting a low-level
graviton disturbance.

221
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,133
How did you know?

222
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,097
That's exactly what happened

223
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:10,433
when we lost power
on the <i>Ganges.</i>

224
00:12:21,081 --> 00:12:23,606
These were originally
Cardassian living quarters.

225
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,948
The bed may take
some getting used to.

226
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:27,385
As an archaeologist

227
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:29,719
l've spent half my life
sleeping in tents.

228
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:31,986
To me, any bed
will be a luxury.

229
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:33,686
You've obviously never slept

230
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:35,319
on a Cardassian mattress.

231
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:38,924
lf you need anything,
just ask the computer.

232
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,263
Thanks, Chief.

233
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,791
Oh, by the way, how's Jean-Luc?

234
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:43,803
The Captain?

235
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:44,804
Mm-hmm.

236
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:46,430
The last time l saw him,
he was fine.

237
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:49,806
Well, now that l'm back,
l'll have to look him up.

238
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:25,108
Really, Vash, l can't believe

239
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:27,340
you're still pining
for Jean-Luc--

240
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:29,645
that self-righteous
do-gooder.

241
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,243
l should have listened to him
when he warned me about you.

242
00:13:32,286 --> 00:13:33,753
You're hurt, you strike back

243
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:35,516
l understand,
but be of good cheer

244
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:38,115
l bring you wonderful news--
l'm back.

245
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:39,284
And l can see now

246
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:41,419
it was cruel of me to leave you.

247
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:44,521
Very touching, but you
didn't leave me, l left you.

248
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:46,896
You left me, l left you--
details, mere details.

249
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:47,991
The important thing is

250
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,730
we're back together again--
a team.

251
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,795
Joined together at the hip.

252
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,032
Not a chance.

253
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,370
You know
you're going to miss me.

254
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:57,604
Don't flatter yourself.

255
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:00,235
You know, l thought

256
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,975
we'd first visit
the Teleris Cluster

257
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:04,380
look in on the star
dancers at Mundahla

258
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:06,386
or maybe head over
to the Lantar Nebula

259
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,888
and view the Sampalo
relic on Hoek lV.

260
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:10,219
Not interested.

261
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:14,318
l know-- Vadris lll,
charming little world.

262
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:15,589
The natives think they're

263
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,722
the only intelligent
life in the universe.

264
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:18,924
No!

265
00:14:23,203 --> 00:14:24,830
All right.

266
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:26,133
You choose then.

267
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:28,733
l choose never to go anywhere
with you again, Q.

268
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:29,764
You don't know

269
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,902
what you're missing.

270
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:32,571
When we started this little
partnership

271
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:35,137
l promised to take you places
no human had ever seen before.

272
00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:36,581
And you have.

273
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:38,413
lt was wonderful.

274
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:40,010
Thank you.

275
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,587
Now, good-bye.

276
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:44,590
Two years in the Gamma
Quadrant hardly qualifies

277
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:46,592
as a grand tour
of the universe.

278
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:49,254
There's still the Delta
Quadrant to explore

279
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:51,594
not to mention all
the other galaxies.

280
00:14:51,631 --> 00:14:52,757
lt's over, Q.

281
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,266
l want you out of my life.

282
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:55,859
You are arrogant,
you're overbearing

283
00:14:55,902 --> 00:14:57,631
and you think
you know everything.

284
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:00,037
But l do know everything.

285
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,938
That makes it even worse.

286
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:04,375
All right, fine.

287
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:05,844
What is it you really want?

288
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,643
l want the life l had
before l met you.

289
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:12,618
And a stellar life, indeed.

290
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:14,779
The eminent Vash--

291
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:18,518
barred from the Royal Museum
of Epsilon Hydra Vll.

292
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:20,549
Persona non grata
on Betazed.

293
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:22,221
Wanted dead on Myrmidon

294
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:24,856
for stealing the Crown
of the First Mother.

295
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:26,729
Dead or alive.

296
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,167
Preferably dead.

297
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:31,102
lt's a wonder
you haven't offended

298
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,730
every sentient race
in the galaxy.

299
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:35,742
You're the one who almost got me
killed on Erriakang Vll.

300
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:37,004
And they weren't
exactly thrilled

301
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,134
to see you on Brax either.

302
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:39,873
What did they call you,
''the God of lies''?

303
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:41,515
They meant it affectionately.

304
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:41,844
They meant it affectionately.

305
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:44,111
Come in.

306
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:46,244
l...

307
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:47,617
Go away.

308
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:49,748
Q, bring him back.

309
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,758
What business could
you possibly have

310
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,657
with that disgusting
little troll?

311
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:54,751
l don't know.

312
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:56,854
You didn't give him
time to tell me.

313
00:15:56,897 --> 00:15:58,865
Now, bring him back
this instant.

314
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:00,127
All right.

315
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:04,670
Can l help you?

316
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:08,875
My name is Quark.

317
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:11,707
lt's, uh, it's come
to my attention

318
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:15,875
that you have access
to certain... items.

319
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:20,114
ltems that might perhaps
turn a tidy profit?

320
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:23,213
l'm listening.

321
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,985
For a percentage

322
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:30,893
l might be able to arrange
a buyer for your trinkets

323
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:32,922
perhaps an auction.

324
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:37,892
l'll only accept payment
in gold-pressed latinum.

325
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:41,567
l'll shower you in it-- 50-50.

326
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:42,905
Mr. Quark, l believe

327
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:46,276
you're trying to take
advantage of me.

328
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:50,249
Some wine?

329
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:52,774
Oh, oh...

330
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:57,518
You have a talent
for <i>oo-mox.</i>

331
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:59,548
So l've been told.

332
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,360
l'll not be distracted
by your feminine wiles.

333
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:07,059
l demand 40%.

334
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:11,363
All right, 30...

335
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:13,872
What magnificent cartilage.

336
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,535
22, and don't stop.

337
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:18,567
You've got a deal.

338
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:25,484
l expect you'll make
all the necessary arrangements?

339
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,886
Oh, you're good.

340
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:32,585
You're very, very good.

341
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:44,459
How perfectly vile.

342
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:46,665
lf that's the sort of company
you kept before meeting me

343
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:48,230
it's no wonder
you ended up with Picard.

344
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,264
Go away.

345
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:51,535
Enter.

346
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:53,102
Aren't we the hub
of activity?

347
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,809
l'm sorry, am l
interrupting anything?

348
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:57,339
No, come in, Doctor.

349
00:17:57,384 --> 00:18:00,012
Thank you, and please
call me Julian.

350
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,613
Julian, is this
medical business?

351
00:18:02,656 --> 00:18:04,248
Well, to tell the truth,
l tried to come up

352
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,122
with some official reason
for dropping by

353
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:07,285
but your excellent health

354
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:08,954
has robbed me
of any excuses.

355
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,893
Well, that didn't seem
to stop you.

356
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:13,695
So, l thought l'd contribute
to your good health

357
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:14,859
by buying you dinner.

358
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:16,869
Quark's makes
a delicious couscous

359
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:20,100
and the company, l hope,
might be mildly entertaining.

360
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,472
Sounds like fun.

361
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:27,208
Uh, though, l would like
to, uh, freshen up first.

362
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:30,478
Could l meet you there
in, say, 20 minutes or so?

363
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:34,248
Those 20 minutes
will seem like an eternity.

364
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,390
These mating rituals
you humans indulge in

365
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:43,555
are really quite disgusting.

366
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:44,564
Get out.

367
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:45,565
You know you don't mean it.

368
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,725
Out!

369
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:47,892
You're making
a terrible mistake.

370
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:48,901
You'll be lost without me.

371
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:50,903
l can take care of myself.

372
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:53,667
Really? Well,
we'll see about that.

373
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:06,862
Oh, just a cup of mint tea,
please.

374
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:10,237
You're making
a terrible mistake.

375
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:14,508
Why? The replicators
haven't malfunctioned again?

376
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:16,310
l'm talking about Vash.

377
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:17,680
Stay away from her.

378
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:20,277
My God, you're
an impertinent waiter.

379
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,286
l'm a friend.

380
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,446
l'm giving you friendly advice.

381
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:23,477
She's nothing but trouble.

382
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:25,923
Really? Well, l don't see

383
00:19:25,992 --> 00:19:27,619
that it's any of your
business who l see.

384
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,423
ln fact, l'm having
dinner with her now.

385
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:31,555
Are you sure you're up to it?
You look tired.

386
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:33,121
l feel fine.

387
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,693
No, no, no, you look
very, very, tired.

388
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:45,507
Oh, God.

389
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:47,513
Funny, l...

390
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:50,516
l do feel a bit... a bit spent.

391
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,744
Maybe l should...

392
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:55,220
Maybe l should go lie down
for a, for a minute.

393
00:19:57,223 --> 00:19:59,555
Hopefully, by yourself
for a change.

394
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:02,922
Bloody hell.

395
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:07,695
Sir, the Klingon scout ship
has departed Docking Bay 1 1.

396
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,566
Good. l'll tell Odo
he can relax now.

397
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:13,371
We've got a problem, sir.

398
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:15,203
l just saw Q
on the Promenade.

399
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:16,469
Q here?

400
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:17,703
What's Q?

401
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:20,541
A powerful and extremely
unpredictable entity.

402
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,708
l was at a Starfleet briefing
on him two years ago.

403
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:25,546
Blasted menace is what he is.

404
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:26,984
What does he want with us?

405
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:29,884
Whatever it is, you can
be sure we won't like it.

406
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:31,219
You might ask Vash.

407
00:20:31,257 --> 00:20:32,281
Why Vash?

408
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:33,690
They know each other.

409
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:35,591
From the <i>Enterprise?</i>

410
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:38,096
l believe they actually met
in Sherwood Forest.

411
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,121
lt was one of
the little jokes

412
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,396
Q played on the <i>Enterprise</i> crew.

413
00:20:46,272 --> 00:20:48,536
Main power grid
has dropped 80%.

414
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:51,566
Sensors are reading
a massive graviton build-up.

415
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:54,239
How long will it take to bring
us back up to full power?

416
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,009
lt's already beginning
to normalize.

417
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,016
You know, if we have
one of these outages

418
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,677
during a docking procedure

419
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:01,778
we could lose
an entire pylon.

420
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:03,186
l've double-checked
every system.

421
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,484
For the first time in a month

422
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:06,355
there's nothing wrong
with any of them.

423
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:10,294
lt's got to be Q--
another one of his stupid jokes.

424
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:11,887
l'm not laughing.

425
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,963
l figured we'd
auction this off last.

426
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:19,630
lnteresting, but hardly
of any intrinsic value.

427
00:21:19,672 --> 00:21:20,639
Really? l thought it was

428
00:21:20,673 --> 00:21:21,799
the best piece
in the collection.

429
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:23,240
Oh, obviously,
my associates have

430
00:21:23,276 --> 00:21:24,368
more sophisticated tastes

431
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,071
than what you're used to

432
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:28,706
but, uh, just so it's
not a total loss

433
00:21:28,748 --> 00:21:31,239
l'll take it off
your hands for, say

434
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:33,252
seven bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

435
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:34,981
lt's worth 50 times as much.

436
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:36,578
Ridiculous.

437
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,649
All right, 18

438
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:43,321
but you must swear
never to tell a soul

439
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:45,262
about my foolish generosity.

440
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:47,163
lf you want it, you're
going to have to be

441
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,496
a lot more foolish than that.

442
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:50,001
All right, 30.

443
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:51,230
Now, give it to me.

444
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,899
Bidding starts at 200
bars of gold latinum.

445
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:57,671
l can't decide
what's more intoxicating--

446
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,168
this Gamzian wine,
or your negotiating skills.

447
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:03,340
We need to talk.

448
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:06,840
The lady and l are having
a private conversation.

449
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:08,547
lt can wait.

450
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:18,190
Tell me, Commander, where
is that doctor of yours?

451
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,290
He was supposed to meet me here
a half an hour ago.

452
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:22,699
Tell me about Q.

453
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:25,067
l'll tell you anything you
want to know, Commander.

454
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:28,500
Just answer one question--

455
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,372
is Starfleet penalizing you

456
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:33,606
or did you actually request
such a dismal command?

457
00:22:40,686 --> 00:22:42,551
l want you off this station.

458
00:22:42,588 --> 00:22:45,284
Don't be hasty, my
happy-go-lucky friend.

459
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:46,951
This dreary little gulag

460
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:49,154
could use a little
color, some excitement.

461
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:51,789
And who better
to provide that than moi?

462
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:55,096
Although, l must admit,
l like your new tailor.

463
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:58,969
l'm not impressed
by your parlor tricks.

464
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:01,337
These power outages
are going to stop, right now.

465
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:02,671
Why tell me?

466
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,676
Oh... oh, yes,
of course, go ahead

467
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,406
blame Q if it makes
you feel any better.

468
00:23:07,446 --> 00:23:08,435
l suppose it's my fate

469
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,540
to be the galaxy's whipping boy.

470
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,051
Oh, heavy is the burden
of being me.

471
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:14,279
lf you're looking for sympathy

472
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,254
you've come to the wrong place.

473
00:23:16,288 --> 00:23:19,951
Actually, what l was hoping
for was a little witty repartee

474
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:22,220
but l can see l'm not going
to get any of that either.

475
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:24,126
At least your beloved Jean-Luc

476
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:26,097
knew how to turn a phrase.

477
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:27,099
Take a hint, Q.

478
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:29,101
No one wants you around.

479
00:23:29,135 --> 00:23:32,400
Really, Vash, this playing
hard to get is growing tedious.

480
00:23:32,438 --> 00:23:34,429
Let's not forget that l'm the Q

481
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:35,804
and you the lowly human.

482
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:38,605
l'll decide when
this partnership is over.

483
00:23:38,644 --> 00:23:39,941
Understand?

484
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:41,105
Why don't you and l

485
00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:43,342
continue this discussion
in private?

486
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:45,077
Excellent idea.

487
00:23:45,117 --> 00:23:46,607
You're right.

488
00:23:46,652 --> 00:23:48,620
This is an excellent idea.

489
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:50,178
Sisko to Ops.

490
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,520
All gone.

491
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:55,560
Bring them back, Q.

492
00:23:55,594 --> 00:23:56,561
Now!

493
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:57,755
Or what?

494
00:23:57,797 --> 00:23:59,355
You'll thrash me?

495
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:02,595
Shall we settle
this mano a mano?

496
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:04,899
Marquis of Queensberry rules?

497
00:24:04,937 --> 00:24:06,404
What?

498
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:10,705
Fisticuffs, pugilism,
the manly art of self-defense.

499
00:24:10,743 --> 00:24:12,904
Come on.

500
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:15,106
lsn't this all
wonderfully barbaric?

501
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:16,307
Go on, take a poke at me.

502
00:24:16,348 --> 00:24:17,940
l know that's what
you really want to do.

503
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,108
Come on.

504
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:21,346
l'll wager five bars
of latinum on Sisko.

505
00:24:21,387 --> 00:24:22,376
You're on.

506
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:23,388
Fight back.

507
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:25,788
This is supposed to be brutal.

508
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:36,827
You can pay me
out of your profits

509
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:38,530
from the auction.

510
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:41,269
You hit me.

511
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:43,275
Picard never hit me.

512
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:45,243
l'm not Picard.

513
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:46,266
lndeed not.

514
00:24:46,312 --> 00:24:49,281
You're much easier to provoke.

515
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:51,306
How fortunate for me.

516
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:22,547
Oh! Not again.

517
00:25:25,284 --> 00:25:27,946
Damn it, Q.
Enough is enough.

518
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:29,584
We're losing atmosphere.

519
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:30,953
Decompression protocol.

520
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:35,393
Mr. O'Brien, raise
the confinement shields.

521
00:25:39,431 --> 00:25:40,489
Shields up.

522
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:41,932
Damage report.

523
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:43,764
We've got a minor hull breach

524
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,771
in one of the upper bulkheads.

525
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:47,329
l'm getting reports
of hull fractures

526
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:48,897
throughout the station.

527
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:50,738
Emergency systems

528
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:52,403
appear to be functioning.

529
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:54,036
Repair crews are responding.

530
00:25:59,218 --> 00:26:00,776
The breach was caused

531
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,448
by some kind of focused
graviton pulse.

532
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:05,855
Every time we've had
a power drain

533
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:07,153
it's been followed

534
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:09,787
by an increase
in the graviton field.

535
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:10,921
lf this continues,
we could wind up

536
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,793
with a breach in one
of our reactor cores.

537
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:13,924
We'd lose half the station.

538
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,398
Maybe it's time

539
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:17,561
we opened
negotiations with Q.

540
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:20,231
l'm not convinced Q
is behind this.

541
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:22,206
Playing with the lights and
punching holes in the hull

542
00:26:22,241 --> 00:26:25,561
doesn't strike me as his style.

543
00:26:27,229 --> 00:26:29,129
You wanted to see me?

544
00:26:29,164 --> 00:26:30,222
Make it quick.

545
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:32,199
l have important business.

546
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:33,292
Yes, l know.

547
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:36,498
You're auctioning off
some artifacts

548
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:38,733
from the Gamma Quadrant.

549
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:43,541
You were eavesdropping
on my conversation with Vash.

550
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:48,539
What were you this time?

551
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:52,645
The table? One of the chairs?

552
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:55,316
The wine bottle.

553
00:26:55,357 --> 00:26:57,723
When are you going to realize

554
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,422
that you have
no secrets from me?

555
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:01,520
l have nothing to hide.

556
00:27:01,563 --> 00:27:04,031
l'm selling quality merchandise
to select clientele.

557
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:07,695
And what makes them so select?

558
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:11,001
They're all
ridiculously wealthy...

559
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,168
and not too bright.

560
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:16,507
l'll never understand
this obsession

561
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:17,637
with accumulating

562
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,874
material wealth.

563
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:21,677
You spend your entire life
plotting and scheming

564
00:27:21,717 --> 00:27:23,878
to acquire more
and more possessions

565
00:27:23,986 --> 00:27:26,284
until your living
areas are bursting

566
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:27,515
with useless junk.

567
00:27:27,556 --> 00:27:28,682
Then you die.

568
00:27:28,724 --> 00:27:30,692
Your relatives sell everything

569
00:27:30,726 --> 00:27:33,058
and start the cycle
all over again.

570
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:43,227
lsn't there anything
you... desire?

571
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:44,830
l have my work.

572
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,898
What more do l need?

573
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:49,910
A suit of the finest
Andorian silk?

574
00:27:49,945 --> 00:27:54,814
A ring of pure Surax?

575
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,374
A complete set

576
00:27:56,418 --> 00:27:59,478
of Tanesh pottery?

577
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:01,079
How about

578
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:04,854
a latinum-plated
bucket to sleep in?

579
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,054
Ah.

580
00:28:09,098 --> 00:28:11,191
Ahh...

581
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,374
Well, l'm glad to see
you've packed.

582
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:23,173
l hope you said good-bye
to all your newfound friends.

583
00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:24,509
l don't have
time for this.

584
00:28:24,546 --> 00:28:27,606
You've led a charmed life
these past two years

585
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:29,674
under my benevolent
protection.

586
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:31,447
l can take care of myself.

587
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:33,512
Really?

588
00:28:33,555 --> 00:28:36,615
Do you remember
that tiny little insect bite

589
00:28:36,658 --> 00:28:39,821
you had on Erabus Prime?

590
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:42,126
lf l hadn't been there...

591
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:50,633
l am not going with you.

592
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:52,799
The galaxy
can be a dangerous place

593
00:28:52,841 --> 00:28:54,570
when you're on your own.

594
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:02,078
lt's over, Q.

595
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:15,986
l leave you now to reconsider
my offer of friendship.

596
00:29:34,082 --> 00:29:37,984
Station Log, Stardate 46531.2.

597
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,545
The station's power is
continuing to be drained

598
00:29:40,589 --> 00:29:42,216
and converted into gravitons.

599
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:46,193
At this rate, our life-support
systems will fail in 14 hours.

600
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:49,220
Sir, we'll never find
the source of the power drain

601
00:29:49,264 --> 00:29:51,596
using these bloody Cardassian
internal sensors.

602
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:53,362
They're just
not sensitive enough.

603
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:55,802
What if we make the power drain
easier to detect.

604
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:58,705
lf we flood the station
with ionized tritium gas

605
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,708
we should be able to trace
the particle flow

606
00:30:00,742 --> 00:30:01,868
to the source.

607
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,036
Tritium?

608
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:04,773
Well isn't that pretty toxic?

609
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:07,111
Only when it's highly
concentrated.

610
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:08,707
We'd only use
a very small amount.

611
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,081
Do it.

612
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:13,315
Unless we get this under control
in the next eight hours

613
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:15,721
we'll begin
evacuation procedures.

614
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:16,883
Still chasing your own tail?

615
00:30:16,925 --> 00:30:18,324
Picard and his lackeys

616
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,555
would have solved all this
technobabble hours ago.

617
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:23,724
No wonder you're not
commanding a starship.

618
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:25,232
Security to Ops.

619
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:28,236
Well, aren't we the feisty
little go-getter.

620
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,238
l'd keep my eye on this one.

621
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:31,500
Chances are

622
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,030
she's after your job.

623
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:35,908
Why don't you do something
constructive for a change--

624
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,912
like torment Cardassians.

625
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:39,743
Do l know you?

626
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:42,909
O'Brien. From the <i>Enterprise.</i>

627
00:30:42,951 --> 00:30:44,248
<i>Enterprise?</i>

628
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:45,583
Oh, yes.

629
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:48,283
Weren't you one
of the little people?

630
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:53,218
Quite a motley crew
you've assembled here, Benji.

631
00:30:53,262 --> 00:30:56,493
My advice to you
is to evacuate now

632
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:59,261
and save all this
pointless guesswork.

633
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,165
Q, either you tell us
what's going on

634
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:02,727
or get the hell
out of the way.

635
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:04,500
l'll tell you
what's going on.

636
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:07,440
While you're here conducting
futile experiments

637
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:09,876
Vash is below engaged
in base commerce

638
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:11,539
and setting Federation ethics

639
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,309
back 200 years.

640
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:16,215
Believe me, gang

641
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:19,812
she's far more dangerous to you
than l.

642
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,931
Kolos, my friend.

643
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:35,799
l don't know
which pleases me more--

644
00:31:35,837 --> 00:31:39,534
your smiling face
or your overflowing purse.

645
00:31:39,574 --> 00:31:41,439
Quark, you obsequious toad.

646
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:42,602
Your so-called

647
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:44,703
Gamma Quadrant merchandise

648
00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:46,111
had better be legitimate

649
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:48,514
or l'll toss you out
the nearest airlock.

650
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,949
No cause for alarm.

651
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:52,077
Each piece comes complete

652
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,851
with a statement of authenticity
from Vash--

653
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:57,483
the Federation's foremost expert

654
00:31:57,526 --> 00:31:59,494
on the Gamma Quadrant.

655
00:31:59,528 --> 00:32:03,794
ln that case, stop sniveling
and give me a synthale.

656
00:32:09,404 --> 00:32:11,565
Are they all that pleasant?

657
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:15,766
l don't care
about their manners.

658
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:17,540
The important thing is

659
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:21,538
they're honest collectors
of antiquities-- every one.

660
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:23,380
How honest?

661
00:32:23,418 --> 00:32:25,318
As honest as you and l.

662
00:32:25,354 --> 00:32:28,585
Well, then, we'd better keep
a close eye on them.

663
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:32,081
My dear, l've been thinking.

664
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:37,224
What would you say to
a permanent partnership?

665
00:32:37,265 --> 00:32:40,564
What with your knowledge
of the Gamma Quadrant

666
00:32:40,602 --> 00:32:44,629
and my business connections,
we could make a fortune.

667
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:47,642
Sorry, Quark, but l've slept
in my last tent.

668
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:51,339
l'm looking forward to a nice,
quiet life back on Earth.

669
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,938
You won't last a month.

670
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:54,413
You're like me.

671
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:57,111
You live for excitement,
adventure and profit.

672
00:32:57,152 --> 00:32:59,143
Not anymore.

673
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:01,985
Would you care to make
a wager on that?

674
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,393
The graviton field
has increased by 60%.

675
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,864
How soon can we begin
the sensor sweep?

676
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:12,799
Not until we've increased
tritium levels

677
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:13,994
to one part per million.

678
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,129
Should only be another
seven, eight minutes.

679
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:17,832
Commander, we're being pulled

680
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,807
out of our normal position.

681
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:21,638
Use control thrusters
to stabilize the station.

682
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:24,144
Firing thrusters.

683
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:32,455
We're still moving.

684
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:33,885
lf the graviton field

685
00:33:33,956 --> 00:33:35,514
is feeding off
the station's power

686
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:38,322
maybe we can cut its supply
by shutting down the reactors.

687
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:40,329
Put life-support
on emergency backup.

688
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:41,955
Take everything else off line.

689
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:49,037
We're still moving
out of position.

690
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:51,301
What's our heading?

691
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,674
Bearing 157 mark 13.

692
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:57,872
Straight into the wormhole.

693
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,260
Now, as you know

694
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:19,496
payment must be
in gold-pressed latinum

695
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:23,596
and all transactions
are final. Hmm?

696
00:34:26,642 --> 00:34:29,440
Remember, bid high,
and bid often.

697
00:34:30,947 --> 00:34:32,539
Ladies and gentlemen

698
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:34,311
our first item is a statue

699
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,978
from the Gamma Quadrant's
Verath system.

700
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:38,884
Now, l suppose
l should take a minute

701
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:41,583
to tell you a little bit
about the Verathan civilization

702
00:34:41,624 --> 00:34:46,391
which reached its height
some 30,000 years ago

703
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,863
and spanned
over two dozen systems

704
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:51,059
interconnected
by a highly developed trade

705
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,567
and communications network.

706
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:54,536
This statue
represents Drohlak--

707
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,004
the Prime Ossemite
of the 19th dynasty.

708
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,336
Vash, what are you doing?

709
00:34:58,374 --> 00:35:01,366
l'm placing the statue
in its historical context.

710
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,536
Give me that.

711
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:05,638
This isn't
the Daystrom lnstitute.

712
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:06,978
Watch closely.

713
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:11,616
Friends...

714
00:35:11,654 --> 00:35:13,383
it's rare...

715
00:35:13,422 --> 00:35:15,413
it's beautiful...

716
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,552
and it's
a Gamma Quadrant original!

717
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:20,824
And it can be yours
for the right price.

718
00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:25,596
Bidding will start at ten bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

719
00:35:25,635 --> 00:35:27,125
Make it ten.

720
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:29,569
Fifteen?

721
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:31,436
Sixteen?

722
00:35:31,474 --> 00:35:32,839
Who will say 17

723
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:36,367
and be the first to own a piece
of the Gamma Quadrant?

724
00:35:36,412 --> 00:35:38,380
Tritium levels
throughout the station

725
00:35:38,414 --> 00:35:40,882
have reached one part
per million.

726
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:43,248
lnitiating sensor sweep.

727
00:35:46,288 --> 00:35:48,779
We can rule out
the docking ring.

728
00:35:48,824 --> 00:35:51,418
The tritium gas
seems to be draining towards

729
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,552
the central core.

730
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:54,062
Where in the central core?

731
00:35:54,096 --> 00:35:56,997
Let me see if l can get
a more precise reading.

732
00:35:58,467 --> 00:36:00,196
lt's not clear enough.

733
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:03,694
l can't pinpoint
an exact location.

734
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:06,401
Based on our current trajectory

735
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:09,673
we'll hit the wormhole
in 18 minutes.

736
00:36:09,712 --> 00:36:11,304
What the hell

737
00:36:11,347 --> 00:36:13,838
could be pulling us
into the wormhole?

738
00:36:13,883 --> 00:36:16,716
Do we have time
to transfer auxiliary power

739
00:36:16,752 --> 00:36:18,447
to the deflectors, Chief?

740
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:19,852
Sir, there's not
enough power left

741
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:20,944
to make any difference.

742
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,787
lf we get sucked
into that wormhole

743
00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:24,053
we'll be in a billion pieces

744
00:36:24,093 --> 00:36:25,856
by the time we reach
the Gamma Quadrant.

745
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:34,330
Sold to Kolos for 36 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

746
00:36:37,273 --> 00:36:39,298
Next, we have...

747
00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:42,467
a dagger...

748
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:47,347
studded with some
very interesting-looking gems.

749
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,509
Think of it

750
00:36:49,552 --> 00:36:52,487
as a weapon and an investment.

751
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:54,887
Bidding will start at 40.

752
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,685
Forty.

753
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:59,286
Forty-two?

754
00:36:59,328 --> 00:37:00,727
Forty-two.

755
00:37:00,763 --> 00:37:02,060
Forty-five?

756
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:04,089
Don't hold back.

757
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:06,795
You know you want it.

758
00:37:06,836 --> 00:37:08,235
Give me 50.

759
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,170
50. We have 50.

760
00:37:10,206 --> 00:37:11,366
l hate to interrupt

761
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:13,841
such a thrilling display
of naked avarice

762
00:37:13,943 --> 00:37:16,138
but l thought
it was only right of me

763
00:37:16,178 --> 00:37:19,306
to warn you that this station
is hurtling towards its doom

764
00:37:19,348 --> 00:37:21,646
and it's very unlikely

765
00:37:21,684 --> 00:37:24,710
that any of you will survive
to enjoy your purchases.

766
00:37:24,754 --> 00:37:26,483
l just thought l'd mention it.

767
00:37:26,522 --> 00:37:27,546
Please, carry on.

768
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,751
Ladies and gentlemen,
l assure you

769
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:31,657
everything is under control.

770
00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:32,956
Drinks for everyone

771
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:34,724
and free use of the holosuites

772
00:37:34,764 --> 00:37:36,959
at the conclusion
of the auction, eh?

773
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:39,593
l don't think l realized
until this moment

774
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:41,125
how evil you really are.

775
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,070
You would kill
all these people

776
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:44,402
to get even with me.

777
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,341
Well, l must admit,
the thought had occurred to me

778
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:50,209
but this station is
in enough trouble without me

779
00:37:50,246 --> 00:37:52,214
although l'd be glad
to save you.

780
00:37:52,248 --> 00:37:53,806
All you have to do is ask.

781
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:56,784
l'll take my chances
with the others.

782
00:37:56,819 --> 00:37:57,686
As you choose.

783
00:37:57,686 --> 00:37:58,015
As you choose.

784
00:37:58,053 --> 00:38:01,284
l'm going to just sit
right here and watch.

785
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:06,386
l've never seen a space station
torn apart by a wormhole before.

786
00:38:06,428 --> 00:38:07,395
100!

787
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:09,659
Sold to my cousin Stol

788
00:38:09,698 --> 00:38:12,599
for 105 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

789
00:38:12,635 --> 00:38:14,535
What if we pumped
more tritium gas

790
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,832
into the central core?

791
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:17,065
The sensors might
be more accurate

792
00:38:17,106 --> 00:38:18,164
with a greater concentration.

793
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:19,231
lt might work

794
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:21,266
but, in four years,
we'd all be dead

795
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,743
from tritium poisoning.

796
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:23,836
Wait a minute.

797
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:24,846
Of course.

798
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:26,609
Bring the reactors back on line.

799
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:27,616
The reactors?

800
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,810
But they'll just
feed more energy

801
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,250
into the graviton field.

802
00:38:30,286 --> 00:38:31,810
lf we generate enough energy

803
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:34,687
it should create a power drain
big enough to trace.

804
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:37,521
lt might also push us faster
into the wormhole.

805
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,584
A lot faster.

806
00:38:38,627 --> 00:38:40,686
lt's a chance we've got to take.

807
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:42,856
Bring us to full
power, Mr. O'Brien.

808
00:38:42,898 --> 00:38:44,229
Everything you've got.

809
00:38:44,266 --> 00:38:46,131
Aye, sir.

810
00:38:47,603 --> 00:38:50,538
Sold to Rul the Obscure

811
00:38:50,573 --> 00:38:54,475
for 151 latinum bars.

812
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,774
And now...

813
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:03,512
our final item

814
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:06,453
and l think you'll
agree with me

815
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:10,618
it was well worth the wait.

816
00:39:15,064 --> 00:39:16,656
Bidding will start

817
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:22,569
at 200 bars of
gold-pressed latinum.

818
00:39:22,605 --> 00:39:23,970
200?

819
00:39:24,006 --> 00:39:26,338
Can l get 250?

820
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:29,037
250. 300, anyone?

821
00:39:29,078 --> 00:39:32,707
300 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

822
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:33,840
350?

823
00:39:33,883 --> 00:39:34,975
Here.

824
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:36,109
400?

825
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:37,846
400.

826
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,217
Five?

827
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:40,847
520?

828
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:47,586
600 bars of gold-
pressed latinum.

829
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,360
lt's not in any
of the crossover bridges

830
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,128
or in the habitat ring.

831
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,862
lt's in the upper core.

832
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:54,868
Three minutes

833
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:57,064
14 seconds to the wormhole.

834
00:39:57,106 --> 00:39:58,971
We're picking up speed.

835
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:00,373
l've got it.

836
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:02,604
The power drain's coming
from the Promenade.

837
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:03,703
Chief, you have Ops.

838
00:40:06,815 --> 00:40:09,045
2,500.

839
00:40:11,587 --> 00:40:15,284
2,500, and one.

840
00:40:23,499 --> 00:40:24,761
This way.

841
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:34,033
3,000 bars of latinum.

842
00:40:34,076 --> 00:40:35,494
My final offer.

843
00:40:35,627 --> 00:40:37,219
3,000 bars!

844
00:40:37,262 --> 00:40:39,492
A million.

845
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:43,524
A million bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

846
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:46,200
-Over here.
-A million going once...

847
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:47,205
lt's by the podium.

848
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,206
A million going twice...

849
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,207
That's it.

850
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,208
Three times.

851
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:51,470
This auction's over.

852
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,477
Sold.

853
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:53,842
Chief, shut down the reactors.

854
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:54,846
We've found it.

855
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,973
And it's about time, too.

856
00:40:57,015 --> 00:40:58,676
Sorry, all transactions
are final.

857
00:40:58,717 --> 00:41:01,686
This item belongs
to that gentleman over there.

858
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,813
l'm reading a massive
graviton build-up

859
00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:05,015
inside this container.

860
00:41:05,057 --> 00:41:06,490
lt's increasing exponentially.

861
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:08,254
We have to get it
off the station now.

862
00:41:08,293 --> 00:41:10,488
Chief, lock onto my combadge.

863
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:14,260
Prepare to transport it
500 meters off the docking ring.

864
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:16,028
But l haven't been paid.

865
00:41:16,068 --> 00:41:17,330
Energize.

866
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,236
Station Log, Stardate 46532.3.

867
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,534
With the embryonic life-form
off the station

868
00:41:54,573 --> 00:41:56,734
graviton levels
have returned to normal.

869
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:58,265
We've used
the control thrusters

870
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,108
to return the station
to its original position.

871
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:05,207
So... you're off to
the Daystrom lnstitute.

872
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,241
Bet you can hardly wait.

873
00:42:07,285 --> 00:42:10,777
Long, boring lectures,
endless conferences

874
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:15,623
whining students
dogging your every step.

875
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:17,060
Sounds delightful.

876
00:42:17,095 --> 00:42:19,222
Of course...

877
00:42:20,365 --> 00:42:23,027
No, you wouldn't be interested.

878
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:24,194
ln what?

879
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:30,766
l hear they've
uncovered the ruins

880
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:34,210
of a Rokai provincial
capital on Tartaras V.

881
00:42:34,246 --> 00:42:38,683
lf you could obtain
some Rokain artifacts...

882
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:40,378
Forget it, Quark.

883
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:42,387
l'm going back to Earth.

884
00:42:42,421 --> 00:42:44,150
Have it your way.

885
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:45,918
An abysmal place.

886
00:42:47,225 --> 00:42:49,125
Tartaras V?

887
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:51,721
Earth. Oh, don't get me wrong.

888
00:42:51,763 --> 00:42:54,664
1,000 years ago,
it had character.

889
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,158
Crusades, Spanish lnquisition,
Watergate.

890
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:01,138
Now it's just
mind-numbingly dull.

891
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:04,472
Well, then, by all means,
don't come with me.

892
00:43:05,877 --> 00:43:08,175
l think you'd be much happier

893
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:11,410
poking about the ruins
of Tartaras V.

894
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,475
l don't need your advice.

895
00:43:14,753 --> 00:43:16,584
You really think l...?

896
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:21,449
You know, l still feel
that l owe you

897
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:24,587
a million bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

898
00:43:24,629 --> 00:43:27,097
Keep it-- just give
me back my life.

899
00:43:27,132 --> 00:43:28,827
You'll regret it if l do.

900
00:43:28,934 --> 00:43:31,027
l'm willing to
take my chances.

901
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:34,436
All right, if you insist.

902
00:43:34,473 --> 00:43:36,703
But it's not going
to be the same without you.

903
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:40,610
When l look at a gas nebula,
all l see is a cloud of dust.

904
00:43:40,645 --> 00:43:42,613
Seeing the universe
through your eyes

905
00:43:42,647 --> 00:43:47,414
l was able to experience...
wonder.

906
00:43:47,452 --> 00:43:49,886
l'm going to miss that.

907
00:43:51,456 --> 00:43:56,325
Well, l guess in some ways,
l'm going to miss you, too.

908
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:59,626
Maybe l could
drop in sometime.

909
00:43:59,664 --> 00:44:01,461
Oh, God, l hope not.

910
00:44:03,368 --> 00:44:04,528
Hey, Quark.

911
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:07,367
What's the quickest way
to Tartaras V?

912
00:44:07,405 --> 00:44:08,633
Ah...

913
00:44:22,587 --> 00:44:25,488
l feel as though
l've been asleep for days.

914
00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:28,083
What?

915
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:31,387
Did l miss something?
