1
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,577
Dress uniform?

2
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,203
l haven't worn this

3
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:23,736
in almost three years.

4
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:26,409
l must have lost
a little weight.

5
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,418
Feels kind of baggy.

6
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:30,079
Ah, it looks great.

7
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:31,383
Besides...

8
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:33,515
baggy's quite fashionable
on Bajor right now.

9
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:34,854
Lemonade.

10
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:37,087
Since when are you interested
in Bajoran fashions?

11
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:43,099
Well, a lot of Bajoran girls
come to the station...

12
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:45,102
with their families.

13
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:47,762
Since when are you interested
in Bajoran girls?

14
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:49,238
Dad...

15
00:00:49,273 --> 00:00:50,706
Wasn't it just a few weeks ago

16
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:52,766
that you were playing
with model starships?

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,778
Try a few years ago.

18
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:59,112
You and l have got to have
a talk, young man

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,913
about women.

20
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:02,043
That's okay.

21
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:03,053
l mean it.

22
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:04,577
There are some things
you have got to know.

23
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:06,055
l already know them, Dad.

24
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:07,613
Oh, yeah?
And who told you?

25
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:09,125
Nog.

26
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:12,658
Nog.

27
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:14,391
So, all you know about women

28
00:01:14,432 --> 00:01:16,491
you've heard
from the Ferengi boy.

29
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,331
We were just talking.

30
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,734
Great.

31
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,998
Listen, l don't have time now

32
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:23,598
but, obviously, l have
a lot of damage control

33
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:25,472
to do with you on this subject.

34
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:27,602
Let's set aside
some time tomorrow.

35
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:29,943
Fine.

36
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,572
Okay, tomorrow morning,
first thing.

37
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:33,981
Fine. What's going on anyway?

38
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:37,078
A Vulcan ship has made contact
with a new species called Wadi

39
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:39,054
in the Gamma Quadrant
three weeks ago.

40
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:41,489
We're expecting a delegation
from their planet.

41
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:43,083
Rolling out the red carpet, huh?

42
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,493
First Contact is our most
important mission, Jake.

43
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,691
lt has to be handled delicately.

44
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,996
You might say
it's sort of like...

45
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:53,003
a first date

46
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:54,004
with a girl.

47
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:55,027
You have to show

48
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,505
a certain respect for...

49
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,939
Ops to Sisko.

50
00:01:57,975 --> 00:01:59,306
Go ahead.

51
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:01,743
The Wadi ship has just come
through the wormhole.

52
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,838
We're sending them
to Docking Bay Four.

53
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:05,007
l'll meet you all there.

54
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:06,846
Sisko out.

55
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:08,545
Tomorrow morning.

56
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:22,061
l'm positive
l packed my dress uniform.

57
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,999
l can't understand it.

58
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:26,468
You look fine, Julian.
Relax.

59
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:29,598
l mean, they are aliens,
aren't they?

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,074
l mean, they won't know
our protocol.

61
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,508
lt'll be fine.

62
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:35,375
Where's your uniform, Doctor?

63
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:37,573
Huh? Uh... l can't seem
to find it, sir.

64
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,674
l mean, l'm certain l packed it.

65
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:41,617
Listen to me,
this is no dress rehearsal.

66
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:44,086
This is the real thing--
our first formal reception

67
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,282
for a delegation
from the Gamma Quadrant

68
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:49,087
and l want things to go right
from this moment on.

69
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,820
-Clear?
-Y-Yes.

70
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:52,453
Let's do it.

71
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:09,745
l am Falow,
Master Surchid of the Wadi.

72
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,304
Welcome in the name of Bajor

73
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:13,179
and the United
Federation of Planets.

74
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:15,048
l am Commander Benjamin Sisko

75
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:18,179
and on behalf
of my senior staff officers--

76
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:21,055
Major Kira, Lieutenant Dax

77
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:23,025
and Dr. Bashir...

78
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,550
Yes, yes, yes.

79
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:27,063
Now, where are the games?

80
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:29,692
Games?

81
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:32,395
We were told you had games.

82
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:37,830
Quark's.
Take us to Quark's.

83
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:44,304
Right this way.

84
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:54,054
First Contact is not
what it used to be.

85
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:54,017
Do they have money?

86
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:56,186
We don't know.

87
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:57,195
We didn't ask.

88
00:05:57,229 --> 00:05:58,196
And that's not the point.

89
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,822
lt may not be your point,
but it's mine.

90
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:01,422
Damn it, Quark,
this is a new life-form

91
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:02,455
from the Gamma Quadrant.

92
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,365
l expect you to treat them...

93
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:06,063
Commander... l'm a host.

94
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,197
A host is an ambassador
of goodwill.

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,435
The more goodwill
that l can generate

96
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:11,965
the longer they'll stay...

97
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:13,476
the greater my profits.

98
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,502
l think we're talking
the same language here.

99
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:16,673
Not quite.

100
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:19,650
Allow me to put
your concerns to rest.

101
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:24,378
So, uh...

102
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,790
do you fellows do
a lot of gambling

103
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:29,225
where you come from?

104
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:30,455
We like games.

105
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:32,827
Doesn't everybody?
Doesn't everybody?

106
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:35,196
You know,
those virgin territories

107
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:36,723
in the Gamma Quadrant

108
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:37,996
are ripe for dabo franchising.

109
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:39,003
Quark...?

110
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:40,334
You and l might want to talk

111
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:42,237
about an investment
opportunity...

112
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:46,775
Heh... at some point.

113
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:51,180
So, uh, have you figured out
the essentials of the game yet?

114
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:53,446
l believe we have.

115
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:55,316
Give her a spin.

116
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:57,913
One time on the house.

117
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:05,427
Ah!

118
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:06,828
Two pinch showing.

119
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:08,127
Oh, too bad.

120
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,260
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained, l always say.

121
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:13,396
What would you care to wager?

122
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:14,928
Ah.

123
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:17,267
Oh.

124
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:18,469
What a handsome container.

125
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,410
There's an old
Ferengi expression--

126
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,436
good things come
in small packages.

127
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:27,413
Sticks?

128
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:29,613
<i>Klon peags.</i>

129
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:32,521
Highly sought in our culture.

130
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:35,720
They have... many...
different...

131
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,352
uses.

132
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:42,660
l'm sorry, but l have
enough sticks right now.

133
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:47,968
What's this?

134
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:49,405
Alpha-currant nectar.

135
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,841
lt's priceless.

136
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:53,070
Oh.

137
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:03,515
One man's priceless
is another man's worthless.

138
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:04,579
Quark...

139
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:06,214
take the juice.

140
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:09,715
Sorry, not interested.

141
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:14,357
Then, we really
have nothing to wager...

142
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,390
except... this.

143
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:25,699
Get these folks some drinks.

144
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:35,575
McCoullough.

145
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,609
McCoullough?

146
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:37,882
Captain McCoullough.

147
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:40,083
That's the name
l've been trying to remember

148
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,387
for the past six hours.

149
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:43,291
Dabo!

150
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:45,728
Good lord, they've won again.

151
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:47,129
McCoullough's the one

152
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:49,998
who wrote the revised
First Contact procedures

153
00:08:50,101 --> 00:08:50,999
for Starfleet.

154
00:08:51,102 --> 00:08:52,160
ls that right?

155
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:54,398
l wish he was here now
instead of me.

156
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:55,633
Dabo!

157
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:57,504
No...

158
00:08:57,542 --> 00:09:00,010
they couldn't
have doubled again.

159
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:02,376
With all due respect
to procedures and to McCoullough

160
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:03,403
l have had it.

161
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:04,915
This is as far as duty takes me.

162
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:06,314
Keep them happy.

163
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:08,911
lf they ever get tired
of playing dabo, let me know.

164
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:10,045
Good night.

165
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:12,113
What's good about it?

166
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:21,489
Getting ready
to call it a night?

167
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,663
We've only just started.

168
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:26,602
But...

169
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:28,970
the girl's arm must
be getting tired.

170
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:31,840
All that spinning.

171
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:33,343
Replace her.

172
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:35,312
Very well.

173
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:38,909
Broik...

174
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:41,582
take the wheel.

175
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:54,292
Oh...

176
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,129
one pinch showing.

177
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,658
An unfortunate reversal.

178
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:09,009
What are you still doing up?

179
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,707
Nog and l were setting up

180
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,978
a reactive ion impeller
for school.

181
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:16,009
Nog is older than you, Jake.

182
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:17,281
He stays up later.

183
00:10:17,322 --> 00:10:18,687
He probably does things--

184
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:20,520
things with girls,
for instance--

185
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:21,786
you're not ready for yet.

186
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:22,793
Come on.

187
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:24,988
We were just working on
a school project.

188
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:28,527
You know what time you're
supposed to go to bed.

189
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:30,625
We never had any problems
with it until Nog.

190
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:32,533
Dad, l'm 14.

191
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,663
l'm glad we agree on something.

192
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:35,934
Go to bed.

193
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:37,805
Fine.

194
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:39,969
So, how did it go?

195
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:41,137
Great. Just great.

196
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:43,238
l've done nothing
for the past six hours

197
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:45,044
but eat Ferengi <i>lokar</i> beans...

198
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:49,079
and watch people
play childish games.

199
00:10:58,196 --> 00:10:59,823
Broik!

200
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:01,491
You disreputable swindler.

201
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,696
l've put up with your cheating
for the last time.

202
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,178
Sit.

203
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:29,459
Look, uh...

204
00:11:29,494 --> 00:11:34,158
why don't we just call it even,
and no hard feelings, huh?

205
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:37,565
Or, uh, take another spin...
on the house

206
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:39,035
or two or three.

207
00:11:39,137 --> 00:11:42,197
A free visit to a holosuite, eh?

208
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,334
Do you know what a holosuite is?

209
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:48,311
Do you have sex on your world?

210
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:56,452
Look, take it all back--
all the gemstones

211
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:59,547
and l'll throw in a case
of Andolian brandy

212
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:02,355
to make your trip home
a little more enjoyable, huh?

213
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:03,985
You like our gemstones?

214
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:06,997
You will have the opportunity
to win more...

215
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:08,156
a lot more.

216
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,359
l will?

217
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,731
ln a new game.

218
00:12:10,768 --> 00:12:13,669
An honest game.

219
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:30,290
Very unusual.

220
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,229
l don't think l know this game.

221
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:33,323
What's it called?

222
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:34,765
<i>Chula.</i>

223
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,995
What are the rules?

224
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:39,766
These are your players.

225
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:44,333
We'll start them
at the second <i>shap.</i>

226
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:45,401
The second <i>shap?</i>

227
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:47,537
Can't we start at the beginning?

228
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:52,749
Only children enter
at the first <i>shap.</i>

229
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:48,302
Sisko to Ops.

230
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:51,003
Sisko to Security.

231
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,546
Computer, freeze program.

232
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,674
End program.

233
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:00,982
Exit!

234
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,104
You?

235
00:14:58,144 --> 00:14:59,441
<i>Shap</i> two.

236
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:00,968
Move along.
Move along home.

237
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:02,947
Where is this place?
Where have you brought me?

238
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:04,950
Move along home!

239
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:06,315
Falow!

240
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:24,558
Doctor.

241
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:27,971
Oh, thank God!

242
00:15:28,073 --> 00:15:30,974
Ah. l thought
l was having a nightmare.

243
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:32,737
l couldn't wake up.

244
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,405
You, too?

245
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:35,914
What was all that yelling?

246
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:37,176
Well, haven't you

247
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:38,843
ever had
to wake yourself up

248
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:39,976
out of a bad dream?

249
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:42,782
This isn't a dream.
We're guests of the Wadi.

250
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:44,221
What do they want?

251
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:45,382
l don't know yet.

252
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:47,358
l just had a strange
run-in with Falow.

253
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:49,725
He had said something
about ''moving along home.''

254
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:51,161
Home?

255
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,563
Perhaps they're giving us
some sort of behavioral test

256
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,657
like a laboratory rodent

257
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,668
who must work his way
out of a maze.

258
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:57,794
Behavioral test?

259
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:58,997
Now wait a minute.

260
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:01,504
There doesn't seem to be
any immediate threat, Major.

261
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,940
Oh, no, l'm sure
all you Starfleet explorers

262
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:05,908
find this absolutely fascinating

263
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:08,345
but l'm
a Bajoran administrator.

264
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,940
This is not
what l signed up for!

265
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,951
l don't find this
fascinating either, Major

266
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:16,647
but l suggest we take Falow's
advice and find our way home.

267
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:19,658
Do the combadges
still work?

268
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:22,627
As long as we can
maintain contact

269
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:25,494
it should be reasonably safe
for us to split up

270
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:27,556
and see if any of us
can find a way out of here.

271
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,727
Use your tricorders
for proximity checks

272
00:16:29,768 --> 00:16:31,065
every two minutes.

273
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:34,971
And if all else fails,
just yell again, Doctor.

274
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:37,065
We'll find you.

275
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:55,755
Mr. Sisko, how can l help you?

276
00:16:55,794 --> 00:16:57,421
Do you know
where my dad's gone?

277
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,158
You can't find him?

278
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:00,825
Last night,
he was making a big deal

279
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:02,458
about us having
a talk this morning

280
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:04,196
but, when l got up,
he was gone.

281
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:05,931
Have you checked his office?

282
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:08,529
The computer says
he's not on the station.

283
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:13,671
Why don't you go on to school
while l track him down.

284
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:15,703
School's closed
while Mrs. O'Brien's

285
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:16,715
back on Earth.

286
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:18,444
Nog and l were going over
to Airlock Three

287
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:20,247
and watch the Bajoran
transport passengers

288
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:21,583
come on board.

289
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,781
You mean, to look at the girls.

290
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:27,525
No.

291
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,050
We were just, uh...

292
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:30,288
Go on.

293
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:31,956
When l find out where
your father went

294
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:32,962
l'll let you know.

295
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:34,726
Thanks, Odo.

296
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,963
Computer, confirm
that Commander Sisko

297
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:41,539
is not on the station.

298
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:42,871
Confirmed.

299
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:44,705
What time did he log out?

300
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:46,711
That information is not on file.

301
00:17:46,745 --> 00:17:48,713
What ship did he leave on?

302
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:51,511
That information is not on file.

303
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,349
Constable Odo...

304
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:59,482
good morning to you.

305
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:00,992
Where's Major Kira?

306
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:04,325
Didn't report for duty
on time this morning.

307
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:06,126
None of the senior officers did.

308
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:07,928
And you don't find that odd?

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,766
l heard that Wadi party
went on all night.

310
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:15,501
How long have you been
a security officer, Lieutenant?

311
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,940
Six years. Why?

312
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:18,509
Lost many Commanders?

313
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:19,841
Lost?

314
00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:21,345
Because you've lost one now.

315
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,371
Sisko's off the station,
missing.

316
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:25,280
All of the senior officers
may be missing.

317
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:26,648
l want a sweep of this station.

318
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,653
And if the others
are missing, too

319
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:31,212
l want to know the last time
anybody saw them.

320
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:32,518
l'm going to contact all ships

321
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:34,116
that have departed
since last night.

322
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:35,183
Understood?

323
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:36,694
Yes, Constable.

324
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:38,356
And don't call me ''Constable.''

325
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:40,365
l'm Chief of Security.

326
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:42,526
Yes, sir.

327
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,129
Last wagers.

328
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:48,196
The board is ready.

329
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,265
lt is?

330
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:53,641
How much do you wish to risk

331
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,306
on the second <i>shap?</i>

332
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:56,974
Um...

333
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:58,483
uh...

334
00:18:58,517 --> 00:19:00,007
is there a minimum wager?

335
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,854
Roll.

336
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,654
Roll? Roll?

337
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:10,662
But you haven't even
told me the rules yet.

338
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:13,665
You're required to learn
as you play.

339
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,428
Roll.

340
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,802
<i>Chula!</i>

341
00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:27,505
Did l win?

342
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:28,945
Hardly.

343
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:32,108
Your pieces
will meet the Chandra.

344
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:33,413
The Chandra?
What does that mean?

345
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:34,419
ls it good or bad?

346
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:37,955
Neither. Both.

347
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:40,253
l don't understand.

348
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,260
Ah, but there's the key.

349
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,955
Some will never understand

350
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:47,362
while others will consider it...

351
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:49,560
mere child's play.

352
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:26,622
<i>Allamaraine,</i> count to four

353
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:28,461

00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:32,327
This is Sisko.

00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,702

<i>Allamaraine,</i> if you can see

372
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:12,904
<i>Allamaraine,</i>
you'll come with me

373
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:14,104
Hello.

376
00:21:17,482 --> 00:21:18,949
Can you tell us where we are?

00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:20,575

00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:21,642

ls there a way to leave?

380
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:25,621
Do you think we're supposed
to do something?

381
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,887
Well, this is the first door
that's opened for us.

382
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:29,586
l want to know where it goes.

383
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:32,824
Are you all right?

384
00:21:32,864 --> 00:21:33,831
<i>Allamaraine...</i>

385
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,127
l'll be okay.

386
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,997
Some kind of ionic field.

387
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:40,002
She goes right through it.

388
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:42,572
The panels on the floor.

389
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,438
She steps on certain panels

390
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:46,909
which must allow her
to go through the field.

391
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:48,809
''lf you can see,
you'll come with me.''

392
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:51,007
...you'll come with me,
<i>Allamaraine...</i>

393
00:21:51,115 --> 00:21:52,673
Watch this.

400
00:22:05,563 --> 00:22:07,690
But l did everything she did.

401
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:09,962
No, Julian, you didn't.

402
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:12,969
l followed her footsteps,
exactly.

403
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:15,062
But you didn't say the rhyme.

00:23:13,564 --> 00:23:17,056
l think l'm getting
the hang of this.

426
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:29,670
Choose their path.

427
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:30,703
Path?

428
00:23:30,748 --> 00:23:32,477
Short or long.

429
00:23:32,517 --> 00:23:33,882
What's the difference?

430
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:35,408
The short path
doubles the peril

431
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:36,886
to your four players.

432
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:38,821
lt also doubles your winnings.

433
00:23:38,856 --> 00:23:41,086
Doubles my winnings?
Well, in that case...

434
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,456
Choose carefully.

435
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:44,518
lf none of your players
makes it home

436
00:23:44,562 --> 00:23:46,257
you lose everything you've won.

437
00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:48,288
Oh...

438
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:51,426
l see why you find
this game so interesting.

439
00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:52,527
Do you?

440
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,094
Yes.

441
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:56,698
You know, l might have room

442
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:59,767
for another gaming table
or two

443
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:01,870
on the second floor.

444
00:24:01,913 --> 00:24:05,644
We might, uh, negotiate
a licensing agreement.

445
00:24:05,683 --> 00:24:06,843
Perhaps we could discuss...

446
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:07,942
Quark.

447
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:10,078
l'm busy.

448
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:11,611
Yes, l can see.

449
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:13,851
When was the last time
you saw Sisko?

450
00:24:13,891 --> 00:24:15,791
Last night,
when he went home to bed.

451
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:17,886
Did he say anything to you
about leaving the station?

452
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:19,123
Not a thing.

453
00:24:19,163 --> 00:24:20,630
Choose their path.

454
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:22,132
Quark!

455
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,463
Really, Odo, you'll have to...

456
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:26,959
He's missing, and so are Kira
Dax and Bashir.

457
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:29,131
Four officers
have just disappeared.

458
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:30,401
You're sure you have no idea?

459
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:32,966
Why would l know
anything about...?

460
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,308
Four?

461
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:37,814
Did you say four officers
are missing?

462
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,373
Yes.

463
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:42,983
Double their peril...

464
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,488
double your winnings.

465
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:59,728
Bet or leave.

466
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,738
Odo...

467
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:04,605
how about taking my place, huh?

468
00:25:04,642 --> 00:25:06,633
Choose their path.

469
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:10,245
l'll, uh...

470
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:11,976
take the safer path.

471
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:16,915
Roll.

472
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:32,802
Rhymes and riddles and mazes.

473
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:35,135
What's the logic
behind all this?

474
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:37,140
What do they want from us?

475
00:25:37,174 --> 00:25:38,300
Move along home.

476
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:40,469
That's what the man
told the Commander.

477
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:41,978
A game.

478
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:44,641
Home is often the destination
in a game.

479
00:25:44,682 --> 00:25:46,309
The Wadi do love games.

480
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,749
Think of it.

481
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:52,779
We've been given directions,
clues, obstacles to overcome...

482
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,426
Pawns.

483
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:10,604
Excuse me...

484
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:11,835
Excuse me...

485
00:26:14,478 --> 00:26:16,639
This has gone far enough.

486
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:24,451
Will somebody please tell me
what is going on around here?!

487
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:26,581
Why are you doing this to us?!

488
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,255
What is wrong
with you people?!

489
00:26:32,296 --> 00:26:35,527
Madam, this is
no laughing matter.

490
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:39,962
Don't eat or drink anything.

491
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:42,529
Maybe it's the Wadi's way
of providing nourishment.

492
00:26:43,574 --> 00:26:45,872
Or maybe it's drugged...

493
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,775
or poisoned.

494
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:57,913
Falow...

495
00:26:57,955 --> 00:26:59,115
Drink?

496
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:05,425
We're not playing anymore.

497
00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:06,760
Move along.

498
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,264
Move along home.

499
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:09,766
You brought us here.

500
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,824
You take us home.

501
00:27:16,474 --> 00:27:17,771
The smoke.

502
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:20,106
Not... bothering them.

503
00:27:20,144 --> 00:27:21,611
You're hurting us.

504
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:24,136
Can't you see... that?

505
00:27:30,154 --> 00:27:31,280
Drink!

506
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:32,812
lt's the antidote.

507
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:53,409
How did you know?

508
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:54,911
Scientific method.

509
00:27:54,945 --> 00:27:56,640
Actually, l took a guess.

510
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,274
lt didn't seem like
l had much to lose.

511
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:06,214
<i>Shap...</i>

512
00:28:06,257 --> 00:28:07,451
four.

513
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:18,565
Let's go.

514
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:38,258
<i>Allamaraine!</i>

515
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:09,719
Now, wouldn't your scans pick up
human life-signs on their ship?

516
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:11,163
Usually.

517
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:13,963
But we've never encountered
Wadi technology before.

518
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:17,869
lsolate that energy flux
on their second deck.

519
00:29:17,905 --> 00:29:21,068
Some kind of intense
bipolar current.

520
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:23,770
What would cause
something like that?

521
00:29:23,811 --> 00:29:24,869
Got me.

522
00:29:24,912 --> 00:29:26,174
The only thing we've got

523
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:28,341
that would put out
that type of current

524
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:29,679
would be a transporter

525
00:29:29,717 --> 00:29:30,877
but a transporter burst

526
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:32,782
would only last
for a few seconds.

527
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,812
Huh... l think we'd
better go take a look.

528
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:37,084
No, wait a minute, Odo!

529
00:29:37,124 --> 00:29:39,490
You can't just go
storming onto their ship

530
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,892
without their permission.

531
00:29:40,928 --> 00:29:43,089
Oh, i-i-is that
Starfleet policy?

532
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,358
That's right.

533
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:46,866
Well, l'm not in Starfleet.

534
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:48,391
Set the coordinates

535
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:51,633
to midway down
the second deck corridor.

536
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:54,308
Uh...

537
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:55,468
ls it against

538
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:58,410
Starfleet policy
to press a few buttons?

539
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:03,347
Energizing.

540
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,111
Choose their path.

541
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:43,851
No! This game is finished
right now.

542
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:45,188
Stop the game

543
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:46,193
lose your players.

544
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:47,194
Odo...

545
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:48,525
just stay out of it.

546
00:30:48,562 --> 00:30:49,620
Quark!

547
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:52,189
l'm doing fine;
they're doing fine.

548
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,962
Choose their path.

549
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:57,334
Double their peril,
double your winnings.

550
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:00,868
Quark!

551
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:01,897
Fine, fine!

552
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:04,035
The safer path.

553
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:06,569
Roll.

554
00:31:14,555 --> 00:31:18,787
An unfortunate roll.

555
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:22,829
lsn't it simply a matter

556
00:31:22,863 --> 00:31:24,888
of figuring out
how to win this game?

557
00:31:24,932 --> 00:31:26,126
Simply?

558
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:27,930
l don't think we have
any other choice.

559
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:30,162
Well, seriously, we've gone
from the second <i>shap</i>

560
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:32,468
to the third <i>shap</i>
to the fourth <i>shap</i> already.

561
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:33,495
What is a <i>shap?</i>

562
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:34,872
l have no idea

563
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:36,934
but we're making progress,
whatever it is.

564
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:39,070
We're playing
for our lives here, Doctor.

565
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:41,479
l don't think you're taking this
very seriously.

566
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:43,142
On the contrary, Major.

567
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:45,175
l find the stakes
to be highly motivating.

568
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,847
Listen.

569
00:31:47,888 --> 00:31:51,756
l'm reading high
magnetic field variations.

570
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:54,283
lntense flux patterns.

571
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:55,955
lt's coming toward us.

572
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:57,759
Find cover if you can.

573
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:45,904
Falow!

574
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:48,945
Next move.

575
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:50,746
What happened to that one?

576
00:32:50,785 --> 00:32:51,752
Why is it there?

577
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:53,151
Next move.

578
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:54,381
Choose your path.

579
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:55,446
Listen to me.

580
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:57,047
l want that player back!

581
00:32:57,091 --> 00:33:00,720
lf you would care to play
the game after he's done

582
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:02,353
it can be arranged.

583
00:33:02,396 --> 00:33:03,761
Choose their path.

584
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:06,733
Double their peril,
double your winnings.

585
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:08,200
Give me the shortcut.

586
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:09,361
The shortcut?!

587
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:10,370
lt's the right thing to do.

588
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:11,302
Are you crazy?!

589
00:33:11,338 --> 00:33:12,532
Double the stakes.

590
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,631
Wait!

591
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:15,107
l know what l'm doing.

592
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:16,370
l've spent my life

593
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,207
figuring the odds
on all sorts of games.

594
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:20,213
Now, l'm just learning
this one, that's true

595
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:22,408
but l know this
is the right move.

596
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,042
The right move
to make you rich.

597
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:25,051
More than that.

598
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:27,019
Look at the board.

599
00:33:27,054 --> 00:33:31,047
The shortcut skips
a whole level.

600
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:35,118
l've learned there are risks
in every roll of the dice.

601
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:39,064
This way, they can advance
all the way home

602
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:41,624
on just one move.

603
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:44,638
Trust a gambler.

604
00:33:49,376 --> 00:33:51,139
Roll.

605
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:56,745
What?

606
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,411
Blow on them.

607
00:33:58,452 --> 00:33:59,214
Would you please just...?

608
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:01,016
Blow on them.

609
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:12,464
<i>Thialo.</i>

610
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,467
What?

611
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:14,900
What does it mean?

612
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:17,129
Sacrifice one

613
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:20,265
so that two may live.

614
00:34:32,686 --> 00:34:34,745
You can't ask him to do that.

615
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:38,622
lf you do not sacrifice one,
all three will be lost.

616
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,923
l can't. Please.

617
00:34:40,961 --> 00:34:42,223
Which player?

618
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:46,256
l don't even know
which one is which.

619
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,394
Select one to be sacrificed,
or this game is finished!

620
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:51,927
Fine! Fine!

621
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:55,873
Fine. Fine.

622
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:09,114
l can't do it.

623
00:35:09,156 --> 00:35:10,623
l beg of you.

624
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:12,785
A terrible mistake
has been made.

625
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:15,317
This is all a misunderstanding.

626
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:17,330
Please.

627
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:20,094
l-l've learned my lesson.

628
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:21,601
l'll never cheat again.

629
00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:24,900
l'll never cheat again!

630
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:26,736
Please!

631
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:29,334
Just don't make me do this.

632
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:31,742
Anything but this.

633
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:37,308
Please! Please!

634
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:40,252
Please!

635
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:41,914
Oh!

636
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,660
Plea...

637
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:54,430
Oh, please, please.

638
00:35:54,468 --> 00:35:55,799
Very well.

639
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:02,841
l don't have to sacrifice
one of them?

640
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:05,071
No. You do not.

641
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,177
We'll program the game
to select one at random.

642
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,914
Final wagers.

643
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,383
Last move.

644
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:25,089
We should have eaten
something at the party

645
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:26,613
when we had the chance.

646
00:36:26,658 --> 00:36:28,421
Commander Sisko!

647
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,518
Doctor.

648
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:31,461
Over here! Hurry!

649
00:36:31,496 --> 00:36:33,054
Where's it coming from?

650
00:36:33,098 --> 00:36:34,395
Spread out.

651
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,899
l can see it!

652
00:36:35,934 --> 00:36:38,425
l found the way home!

653
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:42,699
Over here.
l found an open door.

654
00:36:42,741 --> 00:36:44,072
Come on, Dax!

655
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:47,138
Julian!

656
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:48,908
Hurry up!

657
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:51,211
Julian, are you all right?

658
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,043
Dax!

659
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:58,954
Ah! My leg.

660
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:04,861
Don't move.

661
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,659
Nothing's broken.

662
00:37:06,698 --> 00:37:08,723
What's taking so long?

663
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:10,394
We're almost out of here.

664
00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:11,732
Can't you see it?

665
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,759
Doctor.

666
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:15,602
We need some help.

667
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,040
Dax is hurt.

668
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,277
<i>Thialo.</i>

669
00:37:24,316 --> 00:37:26,784
Move along home.

670
00:37:26,818 --> 00:37:28,046
<i>Shap...</i>

671
00:37:28,086 --> 00:37:29,781
six.

672
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,825
l'm reading a tectonic shift
of two ground masses.

673
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,987
We are directly
over the fault line.

674
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:38,427
The cavern wall structure

675
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:40,624
has been significantly
weakened by the stress.

676
00:37:40,665 --> 00:37:42,292
lt's not going
to hold much longer.

677
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:44,393
See if you can put
some weight on it.

678
00:37:45,604 --> 00:37:47,868
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

679
00:39:02,347 --> 00:39:04,110
l'll never make it across.

680
00:39:04,149 --> 00:39:05,707
There's got to be
a way around this.

681
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,843
Benjamin, you and Kira
can make that jump.

682
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:09,853
We're not leaving you here.

683
00:39:09,888 --> 00:39:11,014
This cavern is going to collapse

684
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:12,455
and kill all of us
if you don't go now.

685
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:15,984
Seven lives is more
than enough for a Trill.

686
00:39:16,027 --> 00:39:18,393
You haven't even finished one.

687
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,261
How could l live out that life

688
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:22,391
knowing l left you behind,
old man?

689
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:23,765
Don't let sentiment
get in the way...

690
00:39:23,802 --> 00:39:25,497
-...of command decisions.
-Of command decisions.

691
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:29,735
Yeah.
l've heard that one somewhere.

692
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:36,444
lf you were hurt...

693
00:39:36,481 --> 00:39:38,574
l'd leave you behind.

694
00:39:38,616 --> 00:39:41,380
Then l'm glad l'm not
the one who's hurt.

695
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:42,511
Major.

696
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:45,785
Major, you go across.

697
00:39:45,824 --> 00:39:48,122
We'll find a way around.

698
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:54,190
We'll be all right.

699
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:58,635
Major, l gave you
a direct order.

700
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,898
Court-martial me.

701
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:01,905
l can't.
You're not in Starfleet.

702
00:40:02,007 --> 00:40:03,907
lf l were a superior officer

703
00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:06,170
l'd court-martial both of you.

704
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:57,988
Oh!

705
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:29,519
Only a few meters more.

706
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:06,329
Hang on!

707
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,860
Benjamin!

708
00:42:20,578 --> 00:42:22,045
They made it!

709
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,377
l won.

710
00:42:23,414 --> 00:42:26,076
l had full confidence
in you, Commander.

711
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:28,085
There wasn't a moment's doubt

712
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:30,417
that you would prevail
in this outrageous...

713
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:31,979
No, Quark.

714
00:42:33,424 --> 00:42:37,258
l'm afraid all your players
were lost.

715
00:42:37,295 --> 00:42:39,320
What? You mean...

716
00:42:39,364 --> 00:42:42,390
we were never
in any real danger?

717
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:46,960
lt's only a game.

718
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:59,507
Time to move along home.

719
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:00,848
Not so fast.

720
00:43:00,885 --> 00:43:03,149
This may all have
been a game to you

721
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:05,986
but we take First Contact
with a new species

722
00:43:06,024 --> 00:43:07,321
very seriously

723
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:08,655
and l don't appreciate...

724
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:09,887
Excuse me, Commander.

725
00:43:09,994 --> 00:43:10,892
Yes, Odo.

726
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:13,293
Before you blame them

727
00:43:13,331 --> 00:43:16,300
you might want to ask Quark

728
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:18,302
just how this all started.

729
00:43:18,336 --> 00:43:20,668
Quark.

730
00:43:20,705 --> 00:43:22,866
l wish l could explain it.

731
00:43:22,907 --> 00:43:27,344
Uh... they just had
a run of bad luck

732
00:43:27,378 --> 00:43:28,868
and then they blamed
me for their losses.

733
00:43:28,913 --> 00:43:29,880
And, uh...

734
00:43:29,914 --> 00:43:31,313
That's not what you said

735
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:34,250
when you were groveling
on the floor.

736
00:43:34,285 --> 00:43:36,810
Oh, that's right.

737
00:43:36,854 --> 00:43:38,913
You were here for the groveling.

738
00:43:39,023 --> 00:43:40,149
Uh...

739
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:44,391
You said something
about cheating, didn't you?

740
00:43:44,524 --> 00:43:45,786
Cheating?

741
00:43:45,825 --> 00:43:48,453
l would have said anything
to end the ordeal.

742
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:50,827
lt was too much for me to bear.

743
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:52,126
You have no idea

744
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:55,293
the pressure l was under,
Commander.

745
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:58,702
lf you will excuse us...

746
00:43:58,738 --> 00:44:01,206
Perhaps someday...

747
00:44:01,241 --> 00:44:02,765
a rematch.

748
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:09,846
You know...

749
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:12,476
this game could work here.

750
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:17,416
lt really could.

751
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:18,947
Excuse me.

752
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:20,289
Falow?

753
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:22,852
Uh, Mr. Falow?

754
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:24,191
A word with you, sir.

755
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:25,823
What's your hurry?

756
00:44:25,865 --> 00:44:28,629
l think you'll like this.

757
00:44:28,668 --> 00:44:31,569
Mr. Falow!
