1
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:11,162
The usual, Odo?

2
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:12,329
Nothing.

3
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:13,668
The usual.

4
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:15,798
lf all my customers
were like you

5
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,674
my family would be begging
in the Promenade.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,439
Oh, l seriously doubt that--

7
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,175
not as long as there
is a Miradorn raider

8
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:25,182
for you to do business with.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,742
Raider? You mean the Miradorn
ship that just docked?

10
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:29,845
The raider.

11
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:32,015
lts reputation, like mine

12
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:34,423
has probably been exaggerated.

13
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:37,860
Anyway, l don't know
the ship or its crew.

14
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:40,421
You didn't make
your usual welcome call

15
00:00:40,465 --> 00:00:42,695
inviting them in
for a free drink?

16
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:45,464
The Miradorns are
a quarrelsome people.

17
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:48,200
l chose to forego
the usual amenities.

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,539
He looks away whenever
we make eye contact.

19
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:52,770
Who?

20
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:54,108
The new arrival--

21
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:56,376
the one the Klingons
brought back

22
00:00:56,415 --> 00:00:57,939
from the Gamma Quadrant.

23
00:00:57,983 --> 00:00:59,678
Croden? He's harmless.

24
00:00:59,718 --> 00:01:03,677
Really? How is it you've
come to know him so well?

25
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:07,158
A man comes in for a drink,
he wants to talk.

26
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:09,819
He didn't seem to want
to talk much to Sisko

27
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,850
when he arrived.

28
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:12,124
Who would?

29
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:14,655
All those Starfleet officers
greeting him at the airlock--

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,689
it would scare me, too.

31
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:18,032
The Federation could
learn a few things

32
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,129
from the Ferengi
about hospitality.

33
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:22,834
They scared him, huh?

34
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,171
Of course.

35
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,803
l wonder what he has
to be scared about.

36
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:44,522
Well, now.

37
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,760
l believe a pair
of twinned Miradorn

38
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,664
just nodded your way.

39
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:54,365
l'm the man behind the bar.

40
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:58,035
Obviously, they want
to use a holosuite.

41
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:02,809
You think the whole galaxy is
plotting around you, don't you?

42
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:05,476
Paranoia must run
in your species, Odo.

43
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:08,042
Maybe that's why
no one has ever seen

44
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,644
another shape-shifter--

45
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:11,155
they're all hiding!

46
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,987
l won't have you coming here
harassing my customers.

47
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:17,688
Order a drink, play the tables

48
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:20,527
or vacate the premises!

49
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:26,193
Rom, bring a flask
of my special langour.

50
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,550
1,000 bars of
gold-pressed latinum.

51
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,250
Nonnegotiable.

52
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:09,757
Ahh.

53
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:16,832
Oh, very nice.

54
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:20,329
Unfortunately, uh,
there's a problem.

55
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,842
Problem?

56
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:22,843
Langour, anyone?

57
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:23,844
What problem?

58
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:25,505
The buyer has backed out.

59
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:27,275
You guaranteed us a buyer.

60
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:29,408
A question has been raised

61
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,714
about the origin of this bauble.

62
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:34,381
A similar one was taken
during a raid

63
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:38,358
on a Vanoben transport
just two light-years from here.

64
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:40,361
lf you had a bill of sale...

65
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:43,728
You didn't ask
for any bill of sale

66
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:45,392
when we contacted you.

67
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,867
You will find another buyer.

68
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:50,393
A buyer who asks no questions?

69
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:52,770
That could take a long time.

70
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:55,367
We don't have a long time.

71
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,846
Just stay, stay,
stay where you are, please.

72
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:01,142
What's this?

73
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:02,479
Don't fire!

74
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:04,451
What do you want?

75
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:06,453
No one is going to get hurt.

76
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:08,318
Just... just give me that.

77
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:11,757
Whoever you are,
you're making a mistake.

78
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:13,488
Well, it wouldn't be the first

79
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:15,223
and probably won't be the last.

80
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:16,252
Give that to me.

81
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:41,078
Security and medical
to Holosuite One.

82
00:06:41,122 --> 00:06:44,455
Five glasses for four people?

83
00:06:46,227 --> 00:06:48,354
He's dead.

84
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:50,023
My brother.

85
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,641
Take them all to security.

86
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:04,645
Yes, take them both
to his office.

87
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,170
Thank goodness
you were close by, Odo.

88
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:08,182
All of them.

89
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:09,581
Get out. Go on.

90
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:30,262
Have you known
any twinned Miradorn, Commander?

91
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:32,067
l haven't met any before now.

92
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,735
ln my species,
we are not just twin brothers.

93
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:37,836
Together, we are
a single self...

94
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:42,674
two halves of one being.

95
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:44,480
l am incomplete now.

96
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,612
You should have
considered the risks

97
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:48,884
before trying
to sell stolen property.

98
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:49,981
You have no proof.

99
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:51,321
Two people were killed
on the transport

100
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,656
this object was taken from.

101
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:55,321
My brother and l purchased it
from a passing Altairian trader.

102
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:56,660
His name?
His ship's identification?

103
00:07:56,697 --> 00:07:58,562
l am the one whose brother
was killed, Commander!

104
00:07:58,599 --> 00:07:59,588
You have only yourself...

105
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:02,228
l'd like for you to return
to your ship now!

106
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:05,005
You have my sympathies

107
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,132
but there may be more questions.

108
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:09,302
Please don't leave the station.

109
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:12,972
l want to deal with the one
who killed my twin.

110
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:15,346
The law will deal with him.

111
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:26,656
My only purpose
in life from here on

112
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:30,186
is to see him dead.

113
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:35,532
Well...

114
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,904
can't say l didn't warn
you about Miradorns, Odo.

115
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:42,307
l assume we are free to go?

116
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:45,073
Do you have enough evidence
to hold them, Constable?

117
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:47,741
As Odo will be happy to confirm

118
00:08:47,782 --> 00:08:51,274
l was just as concerned
as everyone else

119
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:54,345
that this was
a stolen objet d'art.

120
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:58,051
Yes. Curious, but it's true.

121
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:02,127
We'll be on our way then.

122
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:04,529
You know what else is curious?

123
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:09,161
lt's curious that Croden
had a Ferengi phaser.

124
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:13,640
Available in many a port.

125
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:16,165
And it's curious that he knew

126
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,373
the Miradorn were
trying to sell you

127
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:21,472
something of value.

128
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:24,280
How dare you suggest
that my brother

129
00:09:24,318 --> 00:09:25,910
set up this robbery!

130
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:29,320
What an interesting theory, Rom.

131
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:32,884
lf that theory should
ever reach the Miradorn

132
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,191
l'd wake up dead one morning.

133
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:36,958
So, l'd appreciate

134
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:41,697
your not spreading wild
theories about casually.

135
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,938
Lobeless idiot, next time...

136
00:09:57,718 --> 00:09:59,845
Don't you feed your prisoners?

137
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:02,082
The fact that you
just killed a man

138
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,090
doesn't affect your appetite?

139
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,093
lt was him or me.

140
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:09,028
And if he had killed me,
l wouldn't be hungry now.

141
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:10,462
l want you to understand

142
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:12,261
exactly what's going to happen.

143
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,494
There will be a trial

144
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,661
to determine
your guilt or innocence.

145
00:10:15,703 --> 00:10:17,102
We can assign an advocate

146
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:19,765
or you can request one
from your home world.

147
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:23,106
l doubt if anyone on Rakhar
would much care.

148
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:24,303
Really?

149
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:26,836
lsn't murder considered
a serious crime

150
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:28,109
where you come from?

151
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:30,707
On Rakhar,
all crimes are serious...

152
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,616
only there are no trials.

153
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,712
lt's a shame that our first
encounter with your species

154
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:37,553
had to take place
under such circumstances.

155
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:39,890
l'm sorry if l made
things awkward.

156
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:42,487
l didn't have much choice.

157
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,554
Why not?

158
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:48,558
My needs exceed my skills.

159
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:52,039
Now, if l had his talents

160
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:54,303
l would have no problems at all.

161
00:10:54,342 --> 00:10:56,139
l've never heard of a changeling

162
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:58,144
with such versatility.

163
00:10:58,212 --> 00:10:59,144
A what?!

164
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:02,080
A changeling, like you.

165
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:07,581
You've heard
of other shape-shifters

166
00:11:07,622 --> 00:11:09,453
in the Gamma Quadrant?

167
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,754
Haven't they come
through the wormhole yet?

168
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:13,089
l assumed, when l saw you...

169
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,094
lt's a lie.

170
00:11:14,128 --> 00:11:16,460
He heard me talking
in the bar to Quark.

171
00:11:16,497 --> 00:11:19,796
Well, maybe l dissemble
a little.

172
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,961
''Lie'' is a hard word.

173
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:23,766
But shape-shifters

174
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:25,704
are harsh in their judgments.

175
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,538
Feed me

176
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:33,206
and maybe l'll tell you
where l met someone

177
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,579
just like you.

178
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:46,030
l don't see
that we have any choice.

179
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:47,405
We have to contact his planet.

180
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:50,036
Not the best way
of introducing ourselves.

181
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,376
Homicide as a means
to open relations--

182
00:11:52,414 --> 00:11:54,609
it's not exactly how they
teach it at the Academy, is it?

183
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,117
l think you're all wrong.

184
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:57,448
How's that?

185
00:11:57,486 --> 00:11:58,783
They're going to thank us.

186
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,117
Thank us?

187
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:01,383
Oh, that's what l'd do.

188
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:03,584
He's probably committed
all sorts of crimes

189
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,853
in their system.

190
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:07,691
They'll be glad to have the
problem taken off their hands.

191
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,526
There's only one way
to find out. Dax?

192
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:11,658
lt won't be hard to find Rakhar.

193
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,997
According to the logs

194
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:15,333
Croden was found
in a damaged shuttlecraft

195
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,668
about three light-years
from the wormhole.

196
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:21,472
There aren't many
M-Class planets in that area.

197
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,670
You're with me.

198
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:24,906
Major Kira, as long
as the Miradorn ship is here

199
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,209
there's a threat to Croden.

200
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:28,045
l don't want to have
to tell his people

201
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,244
that he was killed
while in our custody.

202
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:32,776
l'll have Odo increase security.

203
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:49,800
Stop in to see if l'd run away?

204
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:52,239
l couldn't get that lucky.

205
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,238
That Croden
is an interesting character.

206
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:00,714
l wouldn't know.

207
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:02,182
Really?

208
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:05,380
l thought you said
you got to know him rather well.

209
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,650
l never told you that.

210
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:11,216
l merely said we chatted
when he bought a drink or two.

211
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:14,888
l've talked to several people
who saw the two of you

212
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,295
engaged in heavy conversations.

213
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:19,732
Why, Morn, here, says you even
bought the fellow a meal.

214
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:23,363
Morn should keep
his big mouth shut.

215
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,079
So what were you
talking to him about?

216
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:34,047
Just being friendly.

217
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:36,710
He was...

218
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:39,277
so out of place here-- alone.

219
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:42,449
l felt sorry for him.

220
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:46,325
You should sympathize
with my kindness.

221
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:48,522
There's no profit in kindness.

222
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:51,999
You attribute odious motives
to my every charitable act.

223
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:55,401
That's because your favorite
charity is your own pocket.

224
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,270
Speaking of odious motives

225
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:00,706
l hear you've
been making inquiries

226
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:03,142
about finding a small ship
to go through the wormhole.

227
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:05,271
That has nothing to do
with any of this.

228
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:06,280
l think it does.

229
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:08,305
l think you were trying
to secure passage

230
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,147
back to the Gamma Quadrant
for Croden

231
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:13,177
in exchange for staging this
tragic little robbery of yours.

232
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:16,657
This could turn into
a much bigger tragedy for me

233
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,956
if you don't
keep your voice down.

234
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:21,462
What did Croden
tell you about himself?

235
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:22,861
Nothing.

236
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:25,662
We didn't talk about
anything except business.

237
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:27,066
lnconsequential things.

238
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:30,195
What's inconsequential to
you may be important to me.

239
00:14:30,238 --> 00:14:32,263
Did he say anything
about his home world?

240
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:34,002
No.

241
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:36,340
Other species in
the Gamma Quadrant?

242
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:38,175
No.

243
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:39,680
Security to Odo.

244
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,205
Go ahead.

245
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:44,275
Ah-Kel and his crew are blocking
the entrance to your office.

246
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,581
Should we clear them out?

247
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,019
Leave it. l'll handle them.

248
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:57,231
You were told
to stay on your ship.

249
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:58,960
Understand me, shape-shifter.

250
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,562
He killed the part of me
that made existence bearable.

251
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:07,200
l cannot stop until l kill him.

252
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:09,301
You're not going to kill anyone.

253
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:10,971
Get back to your ship
and stay there.

254
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:13,276
lf l find you here again,
l'll lock you up, too.

255
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:39,673
You've made a lot of friends
in your short stay here.

256
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,268
Well, l guess you'd
know how that feels.

257
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,677
You and l have a great deal
in common, changeling.

258
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:47,739
We have nothing in common.

259
00:15:47,783 --> 00:15:49,683
We are both aliens here...

260
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:52,312
the only ones of our kind.

261
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:54,549
Each of us is alone

262
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,352
isolated, shut out.

263
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:58,382
Others like us

264
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:00,826
only exist
in the Gamma Quadrant.

265
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,195
l have always wondered

266
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:08,999
why changelings are so
distrustful of other species.

267
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:13,498
l doubt the changelings
on your world

268
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,407
would trust you.

269
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:16,842
Of course not.

270
00:16:16,878 --> 00:16:19,312
There are no shape-shifters
on Rakhar.

271
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:20,746
You just said...

272
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:25,479
You implied there were.

273
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,920
l'm sorry if l misled you.

274
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:31,016
There were shape-shifters
on Rakhar at one time

275
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,890
but that was centuries ago.

276
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:34,395
What happened to them?

277
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:37,227
They were persecuted.

278
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:38,926
Driven out.

279
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:47,237
But l know a place
where there are still some left.

280
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:50,073
Of course,
that was a few years ago.

281
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:51,510
And if you had the chance

282
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:53,207
you'd take me there.

283
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:55,683
Sure, l would.

284
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:56,911
Why not?

285
00:16:56,952 --> 00:16:58,943
Tell me where it is,
l'll have a look.

286
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:01,751
Ah... No, l...

287
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,655
l have to show you.

288
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:06,354
There is no way that you could
find it on your own.

289
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:09,022
The next time you lie

290
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:12,032
l'll save Ah-Kel
the trouble of killing you.

291
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,193
There's that hard word again.

292
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:19,637
There are times
when l don't dissemble.

293
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:21,733
Whatever you call it

294
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:23,835
the truth isn't in you.

295
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:33,680
From the colony
of the changelings.

296
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:16,988
We're in orbit.

297
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:18,761
Open hailing frequency.

298
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,267
Open.

299
00:18:20,302 --> 00:18:22,964
This is the Federation Starship
<i>Rio Grande</i>

300
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:26,098
attempting to make contact
with the planet Rakhar.

301
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:27,301
Please respond.

302
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:34,547
One of your people
committed a homicide

303
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,346
and we have him in custody.

304
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:37,874
His name is Croden.

305
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,912
l'm picking up a signal
in the southern hemisphere.

306
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:43,481
They're hailing us.

307
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:44,958
On screen.

308
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:48,528
l am the Exarch
of Nehelik Province.

309
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:51,498
You will transport Croden
to this location.

310
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:53,433
l'm afraid we haven't
brought him with us.

311
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:55,026
Your communication
clearly stated

312
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:56,569
that he was in your custody.

313
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:57,902
On our space station.

314
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:00,635
Perhaps l should explain
where we come from.

315
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:02,575
We are well aware of the traffic

316
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:04,169
through the newly discovered
passage.

317
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:05,338
We simply have no interest

318
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,177
in contact with anyone
from your Quadrant.

319
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,739
l am sorry to hear that

320
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:11,547
but we certainly will
respect your wishes.

321
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:15,352
We just felt it was necessary
after Croden was arrested.

322
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,290
Croden is an enemy
of the Rakhari people!

323
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:19,885
We request that
he be returned immediately.

324
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:22,419
He's scheduled to be tried
for his crime on our station.

325
00:19:22,464 --> 00:19:26,230
Tried? Croden has already been
declared guilty in absentia

326
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,361
for myriad crimes on this world.

327
00:19:28,403 --> 00:19:30,928
That judgment supersedes
your charges.

328
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:34,567
Return him, and l can assure you
his punishment will be

329
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,907
appropriate to your crime
as well as ours.

330
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:38,640
l would feel more comfortable
if we could find...

331
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,012
l do not know what kind
of people you are--

332
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,109
l do not care to know--
but if your society purports

333
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:46,245
to respect the rules
of our society

334
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:48,347
you will return him
without delay.

335
00:19:52,427 --> 00:19:57,023
Expect him to return
in a vessel just like this one

336
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:58,656
within 52 hours.

337
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,339
lt's an amalgam
of organic material

338
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:16,145
and some sort of crystal.

339
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,214
You mean... it's alive.

340
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:21,483
More or less.

341
00:20:21,523 --> 00:20:23,821
lt's almost like
a transitional phase

342
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:26,190
between organic
and inorganic matter.

343
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:30,163
l've only seen one life-form
that even remotely resembles it.

344
00:20:30,198 --> 00:20:31,563
Me.

345
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,433
ln a way...

346
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:39,202
this stone might qualify
as a distant cousin of yours.

347
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,265
Maybe there's a clue
to your origins here.

348
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:42,571
Where did it come from?

349
00:20:42,611 --> 00:20:47,173
Unfortunately,
the only one who can tell me

350
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:49,706
is less reliable than Quark.

351
00:21:06,568 --> 00:21:08,729
How do you like
my stone, changeling?

352
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,794
Where'd you get it?

353
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:13,035
What would telling you get me?

354
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:14,439
Nothing.

355
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:16,137
Ah.

356
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:17,474
Well, that's too bad.

357
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:19,707
l was hoping
you'd feel sorry for me

358
00:21:19,748 --> 00:21:21,739
seeing as we're
the only two here

359
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:23,910
from the other side
of the passage.

360
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:26,147
l feel nothing
for you but contempt.

361
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:29,714
You're a thief and a killer,
and who knows what else.

362
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:31,487
Typical. lt's typical.

363
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:33,426
Of ''changeling behavior''?

364
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:34,758
Yes, l'm sure.

365
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:36,229
Uh, excuse me.

366
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:50,668
ln my sector

367
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:52,577
there is a nebula
called the Chamra Vortex.

368
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:55,276
There are millions
of asteroids in it.

369
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:57,876
l found this stone
on one of them.

370
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,581
l could take you to it,
changeling.

371
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:02,783
Others must know where it is.

372
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:06,123
No, no, the Vortex is uncharted
but, as a thief

373
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:09,961
and a killer and who knows what,
l hid there often.

374
00:22:09,998 --> 00:22:13,331
l found this colony
of changelings by chance

375
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:15,165
and l know my way back.

376
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,530
Come in.

377
00:22:28,374 --> 00:22:29,568
Yes, Commander?

378
00:22:29,608 --> 00:22:32,702
Constable, l want you
to escort the prisoner

379
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:34,508
back to his home planet.

380
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:40,742
He's... not to stand trial...
here?

381
00:22:40,786 --> 00:22:43,584
Croden apparently
committed crimes on Rakhar.

382
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:44,748
His government is adamant

383
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,781
and the Bajorans have agreed
to release him.

384
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:50,990
We're going to have trouble
getting him past the Miradorn.

385
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,258
Yes, l know.

386
00:22:52,298 --> 00:22:53,663
Ah-Kel's been
screening every ship

387
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:54,688
leaving this station.

388
00:22:56,635 --> 00:22:59,604
How soon can you be ready?

389
00:22:59,638 --> 00:23:01,196
l'm ready now.

390
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,537
There's a Rigelian freighter

391
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:04,770
leaving here for the Gamma
Quadrant in an hour.

392
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,778
Maybe we can use them
to run interference

393
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:08,507
between you
and the Miradorn ship.

394
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:12,515
l'll move the prisoner
to the runabout right away.

395
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:15,111
Constable, once you're
on the other side

396
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:16,621
you'll be on your own.

397
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:19,988
The Miradorn vessel can
outrun any of our runabouts

398
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,856
and, if they do come after you

399
00:23:21,894 --> 00:23:25,022
a warning from us will
just point an arrow to you.

400
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:26,554
Understood.

401
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,879
So you're finally
taking me up on my offer.

402
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:52,823
l'm taking you home.

403
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:58,720
Commander.

404
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,192
The Rigelian freighter's
ready for departure.

405
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:05,430
Signal Odo.

406
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,646
The Miradorn ship
is scanning the freighter.

407
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:25,623
Doesn't look like
they're reading the runabout.

408
00:24:42,575 --> 00:24:45,476
How do you stand it, changeling?

409
00:24:45,511 --> 00:24:48,241
Living where you don't belong?

410
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:55,546
Are you happy?

411
00:24:55,588 --> 00:24:58,887
l'm as much a part
of the place as anyone else.

412
00:24:58,924 --> 00:25:00,152
Oh, l doubt it.

413
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:02,820
They tolerate you,
but you're not one of them.

414
00:25:02,862 --> 00:25:04,193
Being what you are

415
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,199
you can pour your square shape
into a round hole

416
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:08,791
but you don't really fit,
do you?

417
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,131
You're like my stone.

418
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:11,500
l think l finally figured out

419
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:14,165
what crime you were
found guilty of on your world.

420
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:15,195
What's that?

421
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:16,606
You talk too much.

422
00:25:19,178 --> 00:25:21,476
Maybe you're right.

423
00:25:21,514 --> 00:25:24,142
Perhaps that is how it started.

424
00:25:24,183 --> 00:25:28,483
Perhaps l asked
one question too many.

425
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:31,888
Anyway, that's as good
an explanation as any.

426
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:34,392
Explanation for what?

427
00:25:36,028 --> 00:25:38,519
For why they came that night.

428
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:44,162
l was never told, and,
to this day, l don't know.

429
00:25:44,203 --> 00:25:46,364
They broke into my home
just before dawn

430
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:48,305
and, before l had time
to stop them

431
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,137
they had murdered both my wives.

432
00:25:52,711 --> 00:25:54,338
You see...

433
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,642
on my world

434
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,946
the punishment for being
an enemy of the people

435
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:01,009
is the death of your family.

436
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:03,954
l had no
sophisticated weapon...

437
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:06,457
only a short slaughter knife

438
00:26:06,492 --> 00:26:09,950
that l used for cutting
the necks of fowl

439
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:12,463
that we would
prepare for supper.

440
00:26:12,498 --> 00:26:15,467
lmagine my surprise
when l discovered

441
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:18,470
that the necks
of the security officers

442
00:26:18,504 --> 00:26:22,463
were no more difficult
to cut than the birds'.

443
00:26:22,508 --> 00:26:24,476
Even the sound they made

444
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:29,004
as the blade crossed
their gullets were similar.

445
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:34,474
You expect me
to believe this appalling tale?

446
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,489
Would it make any difference
if you did?

447
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:38,683
No.

448
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:45,395
Well, then believe it,
because it's true.

449
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:48,832
Oh, my return
will be celebrated, changeling.

450
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:50,164
They'll be very grateful.

451
00:26:50,202 --> 00:26:51,464
You'll be a hero.

452
00:26:51,503 --> 00:26:53,494
Perhaps
you might even use this

453
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,666
as an excuse
to exchange envoys.

454
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:57,005
lf you don't stop talking

455
00:26:57,042 --> 00:26:59,340
l could sedate you
for the rest of the trip.

456
00:27:01,814 --> 00:27:03,441
Sorry. l didn't...

457
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:05,450
l didn't know l bothered you.

458
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:16,650
Get in there!

459
00:27:16,695 --> 00:27:18,128
He's going to kill us!

460
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:20,791
He says we were in with Croden.

461
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:22,596
Where is he, Quark?

462
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:24,398
Croden? He's in security.

463
00:27:25,037 --> 00:27:26,163
You're lying!

464
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:28,966
He's gone!

465
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:30,134
You're hiding him.

466
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:32,643
You've been in this
together all along.

467
00:27:32,678 --> 00:27:35,977
You're as responsible
for my brother's death as he is.

468
00:27:36,015 --> 00:27:37,312
Ah-Kel, no.

469
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:38,976
This is Odo's doing.

470
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:40,485
Don't you see?

471
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:43,147
He wants to turn us
against each other.

472
00:27:43,188 --> 00:27:44,348
Why should l believe you?

473
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,018
Tell me where Croden is

474
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:50,152
or you can die in his place.

475
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:52,163
l don't know where he is

476
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:53,824
but maybe l could find out

477
00:27:53,866 --> 00:27:55,857
if you'll just release me.

478
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,436
Get me the security chips.

479
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:09,476
Level four clearance.

480
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,408
lt isn't at all clear...

481
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,244
The coordinates
are very clearly stated

482
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,517
right here in the log entry.

483
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:55,922
One more thing, little Ferengi--

484
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:58,156
you better be telling me
the truth

485
00:28:58,197 --> 00:29:00,188
or l'll be back...

486
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:02,957
to finish this.

487
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:14,442
Oh, you are clever, brother.

488
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,974
Now Ah-Kel will rid us
of Croden and Odo.

489
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:23,214
Unless Odo is sensible,
and gives up his prisoner.

490
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:24,779
Oh, no!

491
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:29,783
Then Croden would tell Ah-Kel
the truth about our plan.

492
00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:32,456
We're dead. We're dead.

493
00:29:32,498 --> 00:29:33,988
You shouldn't have told
him how to find them.

494
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:36,330
Be quiet.

495
00:29:36,368 --> 00:29:39,337
Odo will never give up
his prisoner.

496
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:41,862
He'll just get himself killed.

497
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:43,772
Do you really think so?

498
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:47,142
Oh, get out of here, you fool!

499
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:49,044
Get!

500
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:52,143
Yes, Chief?

501
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:54,311
The Miradorn ship
is leaving the station.

502
00:29:54,353 --> 00:29:57,151
Major, do whatever
you can to delay them.

503
00:29:57,189 --> 00:29:59,987
Ops to Miradorn ship...
please hold your position.

504
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:02,892
Stand by for
departure instructions.

505
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:03,986
No response.

506
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:05,326
They're still moving.

507
00:30:05,364 --> 00:30:08,026
Dax, how long
before Odo reaches Rakhar?

508
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:10,500
Just over five hours.

509
00:30:10,536 --> 00:30:12,003
Miradorn vessel...

510
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:14,835
you are in violation
of Bajoran transit regulations.

511
00:30:14,873 --> 00:30:17,171
Please return at once
to the docking ring.

512
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:19,177
They've increased power
to their thrusters.

513
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:20,603
On screen.

514
00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:39,476
You'd save time going
through the Vortex.

515
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:41,854
lt's a long way around it.

516
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:53,165
Aren't you the least bit curious
about your own people?

517
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:54,999
Of course, l am.

518
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:57,665
Unfortunately,
l don't have the liberty

519
00:30:57,707 --> 00:31:00,175
of pursuing that curiosity
right now.

520
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:02,439
They don't maintain
a humanoid shape, you know.

521
00:31:02,478 --> 00:31:06,209
They refused to assimilate
on my world.

522
00:31:06,248 --> 00:31:08,182
They're a proud species.

523
00:31:08,217 --> 00:31:10,981
That's why
they were so persecuted.

524
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,318
But l will say this for them--

525
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:17,815
they treated me well enough
when l landed at their colony.

526
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,293
l was badly wounded.

527
00:31:19,328 --> 00:31:21,455
They could have
allowed me to die.

528
00:31:21,497 --> 00:31:22,464
They didn't.

529
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:23,988
You're one of them.

530
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,795
That's for sure.

531
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:29,293
You have the sense
of decency, of justice...

532
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:31,738
You don't give up, do you?

533
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:35,473
Computer, what was that?

534
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,240
A temporary loss of stability

535
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,771
resulting from the impact
of a concentrated plasma charge.

536
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,807
We're being attacked?

537
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:43,978
Affirmative.

538
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:48,319
Pursuing vessel approaching
from 181 mark 12.

539
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:50,655
Put it on the monitor
and identify.

540
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:52,991
Miradorn vessel, Theta class.

541
00:31:53,028 --> 00:31:54,154
He's hailing us.

542
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:57,188
The first shot was a warning.

543
00:31:57,233 --> 00:32:00,031
You will surrender
the Rakhari prisoner to me.

544
00:32:00,102 --> 00:32:03,128
l don't give up my prisoners,
Ah-Kel.

545
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,106
Very well.

546
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:07,507
Then you can die with him.

547
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:13,975
Warning. Damage to shields.

548
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,745
Computer, evasive maneuvers!

549
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,122
Warning. Shields at 41%.

550
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:26,151
Your computer's
not going to outsmart him.

551
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,958
l'm a security chief,
not a combat pilot!

552
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:28,986
Then give me the controls!

553
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:29,998
You?!

554
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,465
l can get us through the Vortex.

555
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,524
The ionized gasses

556
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:34,968
would screen us
from his sensors.

557
00:32:35,004 --> 00:32:38,735
Drop your suspicious nature
for a minute, changeling.

558
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:42,505
Can't you see?
lt's our only chance!

559
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:05,763
Why are we slowing down?

560
00:33:05,801 --> 00:33:08,395
The Vortex is riddled
with volatile pockets

561
00:33:08,437 --> 00:33:10,098
of a gas we call <i>toh-maire.</i>

562
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:11,504
lf we destabilize them

563
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,236
they could ignite,
and blow this ship apart.

564
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:19,740
You really have been
through here before.

565
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:22,580
Sometimes l do tell the truth.

566
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:25,951
How do you remember
what's true and what isn't?

567
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,986
l thought you said they couldn't
detect us in here.

568
00:33:30,025 --> 00:33:32,289
He must be following
our impulse wake.

569
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:34,956
Computer,
disengage impulse engines.

570
00:33:34,997 --> 00:33:36,624
Go to thrusters.

571
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:37,962
Acknowledged.

572
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,160
Thrusters engaged.

573
00:33:41,036 --> 00:33:42,162
What are you doing?

574
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:43,967
Once our impulse wake drops off

575
00:33:44,006 --> 00:33:47,100
he might try to pick up
the discharge of our thrusters.

576
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:48,939
We'll be better off if we land.

577
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:51,208
So, changeling

578
00:33:51,247 --> 00:33:53,545
l guess l'm going
to take you home after all.

579
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,067
Hurry! This way!

580
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:20,439
Croden!

581
00:34:21,444 --> 00:34:22,911
Slow down, Croden!

582
00:34:22,945 --> 00:34:25,106
Stay where l can see you.

583
00:34:27,116 --> 00:34:28,743
Croden!

584
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:29,910
What's your hurry?

585
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:30,919
What's in here?

586
00:34:30,953 --> 00:34:32,420
l told you-- the colony.

587
00:34:32,455 --> 00:34:34,082
Anxious to see
them again, are you?

588
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:35,249
Yes. Of course.

589
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,191
Whatever it is you came
here for, you can forget it.

590
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:38,193
We're leaving.

591
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:39,558
-No!
-Now!

592
00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:44,262
How much of it was true?
Any of it?

593
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,597
Any of it?!

594
00:34:45,634 --> 00:34:47,101
No. No.

595
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:51,436
On Rakhar, we tell stories
about changelings.

596
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:55,274
l thought they were
myths until l met you.

597
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,335
The stone!

598
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:58,278
l have no idea
where it came from.

599
00:34:58,314 --> 00:35:00,782
Rakhari merchants
buy stones just like it

600
00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:02,215
from off-world traders.

601
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:03,377
lt's used as a key.

602
00:35:03,419 --> 00:35:04,886
A key to what?

603
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,047
To my only reason for living.

604
00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:10,081
And it's ahead,
in that cavern there.

605
00:35:25,441 --> 00:35:27,068
Please, help me.

606
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:29,600
There's been a cave-in.

607
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:32,742
What is it?

608
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:34,749
A stasis chamber.

609
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:40,052
lt's my daughter.

610
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:42,421
The only member
of my family l could save.

611
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:43,447
Help me.

612
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:55,726
lt shapes itself
to fit the lock.

613
00:36:18,294 --> 00:36:20,728
Father?

614
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:22,890
l was dreaming about you.

615
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:24,866
l'm here now, Yareth.

616
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,630
You don't have to dream anymore.

617
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,448
Hello.

618
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:49,254
This is Odo.

619
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,918
He's a security officer.

620
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,258
No, no, he's not
going to hurt you.

621
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,092
He's going to take you

622
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,325
to a place
where you'll be safe.

623
00:36:57,366 --> 00:36:58,526
Won't you?

624
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,037
Where are you going?

625
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,047
l'm going home.

626
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:14,709
But you can't.
They'll kill you.

627
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,719
Yareth, l must answer
for my crimes.

628
00:37:17,753 --> 00:37:20,916
But all you did was
try to protect us.

629
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,221
Their sensors must have
picked up our life signs.

630
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:26,750
We've got to get
back to the runabout.

631
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:31,961
Odo!

632
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:39,900
ls he badly hurt?

633
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:41,569
There's no way to tell.

634
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,204
l don't know anything
about his species.

635
00:37:44,246 --> 00:37:46,077
l'll carry him back to the ship.

636
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,152
What's the matter, Father?

637
00:37:59,294 --> 00:38:01,159
Nothing, darling.

638
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,791
Nothing.
Nothing.

639
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,562
Go! Go!

640
00:38:19,682 --> 00:38:21,741
You're heavier than you look.

641
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:29,550
You could have left me behind.

642
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:31,115
Don't thank me.

643
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,061
l already regret it.

644
00:38:34,096 --> 00:38:36,428
l haven't been able
to lose them.

645
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:38,729
Sooner or later,
one of his photons

646
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:40,394
is going trigger
a <i>toh-maire</i> explosion

647
00:38:40,436 --> 00:38:41,494
and kill us all.

648
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:49,403
Let me have the controls.

649
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:52,039
Find us
one of those <i>toh-maire</i> fields.

650
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:54,481
l just told you, you don't want
to go anywhere near one

651
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:55,574
changeling.

652
00:38:55,617 --> 00:38:58,313
Find us
the closest <i>toh-maire</i> field.

653
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:02,446
Six degrees to starboard.

654
00:39:02,491 --> 00:39:03,856
Changing course.

655
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:06,019
He's chased us everywhere else.

656
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:08,495
Maybe he'll follow us
in there, too.

657
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,861
His sensors may not be able

658
00:39:09,898 --> 00:39:11,695
to detect
how volatile the field is.

659
00:39:11,734 --> 00:39:13,793
lf he fires on us in there,
the whole thing will ignite.

660
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:15,497
That's what l'm counting on.

661
00:39:22,044 --> 00:39:24,512
Set a course
along the interior perimeter.

662
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:27,343
Done.

663
00:39:27,382 --> 00:39:29,373
Computer, shut down all engines.

664
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:31,386
Engines disengaged.

665
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,217
Maintain emergency readiness

666
00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:35,519
to reengage impulse
on my command.

667
00:39:35,557 --> 00:39:38,458
We're an awfully easy target.

668
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,058
He's hailing us.

669
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:47,363
On screen.

670
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:50,462
Are you prepared
to surrender your prisoner?

671
00:39:50,506 --> 00:39:54,306
l have a full array of Starfleet
weapons trained on you, Ah-Kel.

672
00:39:54,343 --> 00:39:55,674
Frankly, l don't
know much about them

673
00:39:55,711 --> 00:39:57,542
but l understand they
equipped this little vessel

674
00:39:57,579 --> 00:39:58,739
with some
pretty powerful stuff

675
00:39:58,781 --> 00:39:59,873
so l suggest

676
00:39:59,915 --> 00:40:02,076
you withdraw
while you still can.

677
00:40:02,117 --> 00:40:05,575
There will barely be a trace
of your little vessel

678
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:07,418
when we are finished with you.

679
00:40:10,692 --> 00:40:13,422
He's coming about.

680
00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:14,895
Powering his shields.

681
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,195
His starboard photon bank
is armed.

682
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:21,327
Computer, engage!

683
00:40:24,373 --> 00:40:26,000
He's firing photons.

684
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,838
ls everybody back there
in one piece?

685
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,465
Yes.

686
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,503
Good.

687
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:51,379
Take us out
of your precious Vortex.

688
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,826
l only have one
last favor to ask.

689
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,993
Yareth is going to be
alone on your world

690
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,730
just as you've always been.

691
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:16,733
She's going to need someone
to look after her.

692
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,644
lf you're asking me
what l think you're asking...

693
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,243
We know you could use
some company, changeling.

694
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:31,049
You'll deny it, but we
both know it's true

695
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,249
or this stone would have
meant nothing to you.

696
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,349
lncoming subspace signal.

697
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:38,362
Vulcan band frequency.

698
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:41,194
On screen.

699
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,563
Starfleet Runabout

700
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,898
this is the Vulcan Science
Vessel <i>T'Vran.</i>

701
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,425
Are you in any difficulty?

702
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,631
Chief of Security Odo
from DS9.

703
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,900
We're fine, Captain.

704
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,171
We detected a major eruption
in the Chamra Vortex.

705
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,508
l was afraid a small ship
like yours

706
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,309
might have suffered damage.

707
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,111
l appreciate your concern.

708
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,845
What's your course?

709
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,979
To the wormhole,
then home to Vulcan.

710
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,449
l've beamed over two survivors

711
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,789
from a ship
that wasn't so lucky.

712
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,886
l have to complete a mission.

713
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:15,124
Could you give them
transportation to Vulcan?

714
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,428
Easily done.

715
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,300
We will rendezvous
with you shortly.

716
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,201
Prepare for transport.

717
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,139
Don't thank me.

718
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:27,838
l already regret it.

719
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,312
How?

720
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,079
How will you explain
not delivering me?

721
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,113
l'll tell them you were killed

722
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,591
when Ah-Kel torpedoed
the asteroid.

723
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:46,153
This dissembling
must be catching.

724
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:48,825
You're going to have
to get used to living

725
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,265
in an alien society.

726
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,495
Like you...

727
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,332
but l know where my home is

728
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,837
and perhaps, someday

729
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,999
l'll be able to go back again.

730
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,837
l hope this helps you
to find where you came from.

731
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,222
<i>T'Vran</i> to <i>Ganges.</i>

732
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,350
Ready for transport.

733
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,359
Stand by.

734
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,452
Are you really a changeling?

735
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:22,023
Yes...

736
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,057
l suppose l am.

737
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:30,899
Go on.

738
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,569
We don't want to keep
the Vulcans waiting.

739
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,076
Energizing.

740
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,728
Computer, set a course
for the wormhole.

741
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,563
Course laid in.

742
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,432
Ready engines.

743
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,370
Home.

744
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,536
Where is it?

745
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,678
Someday we'll know...

746
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,380
cousin.

747
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,385
Engage.
