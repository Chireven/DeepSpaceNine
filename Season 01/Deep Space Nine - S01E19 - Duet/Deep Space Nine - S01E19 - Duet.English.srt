1
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:09,099
We never cared what we did

2
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:11,499
as long as it annoyed
the grown-ups.

3
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:13,594
All inner deflector
shield subsystems

4
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:15,229
are showing equal intensity.

5
00:00:15,272 --> 00:00:17,832
Power balance levels
are reading normal.

6
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,036
l was a champion window breaker.

7
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:23,774
On a dark night with a few
rocks, l was deadly.

8
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:27,147
Um, which you are
you talking about?

9
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:31,746
We're being hailed
by an incoming freighter.

10
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,383
Open a channel.

11
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:35,949
On screen.

12
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:37,654
Welcome to DS9.

13
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:38,787
l'm Major Kira Nerys.

14
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,127
This is the Kobheerian Freighter
<i>Rak-Miunis</i>

15
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:42,859
requesting permission to dock.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,528
Docking Port 6
is clear for approach.

17
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:46,797
Thank you.

18
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:50,398
We have a passenger on board
requiring medical assistance.

19
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:53,069
Can you tell us what's wrong
with your passenger?

20
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,476
He says it's a condition
called Kalla-Nohra.

21
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,003
lt's apparently chronic

22
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,038
but he doesn't have
his medication.

23
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,948
Beam him directly
to our lnfirmary.

24
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:02,680
We'll have our doctor
standing by.

25
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,449
Thank you, Commander.

26
00:01:04,488 --> 00:01:06,080
<i>Rak-Miunis</i> out.

27
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:07,249
Dax to lnfirmary.

28
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,986
This is Bashir.
Go ahead.

29
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:11,893
A Kobheerian transport is
about to beam a patient to you.

30
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:14,898
He's suffering from something
called Kalla-Nohra.

31
00:01:14,932 --> 00:01:16,297
l'm not aware of it.

32
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,528
l'll check the computer.

33
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:22,903
Commander, l'd like to go
down to the lnfirmary

34
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,998
and meet that patient.

35
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,440
Of course. Why?

36
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:28,274
The only cases
of Kalla-Nohra l know of

37
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:30,371
were the result
of a mining accident

38
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:33,474
at a Bajoran forced labor camp
that l helped liberate.

39
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:35,109
The survivors of Gallitep

40
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:38,087
have always been a symbol
to us of strength and courage.

41
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:39,612
By all means, Major.

42
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:42,091
Take as much time as you want.

43
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:57,638
Ah, Major.

44
00:01:57,675 --> 00:01:59,575
l'll be right with you.

45
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:04,448
Kira to Odo.

46
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:05,449
Go ahead.

47
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:06,609
l'm in the lnfirmary.

48
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,776
l need security here

49
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:08,785
on the double.

50
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:09,808
l'm on my way, Major.

51
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:13,889
What's the matter, Major?

52
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:15,720
Your patient is a criminal.

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,228
Good afternoon.

54
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,898
l assume this is the problem.

55
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,031
Problem?

56
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:32,268
Lock him up.

57
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:33,798
This is outrageous.
On what charge?

58
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:35,538
Will somebody tell me
what's going on?

59
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:36,909
This man needs medical care.

60
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:38,811
Then give it to him
in his cell.

61
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:40,543
l haven't done anything.

62
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,073
Then why did you run?

63
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:45,677
l'm trying to get away
from this Bajoran fanatic.

64
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:47,656
The look of hate in her eyes--
she'd like to kill me.

65
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,181
Oh? And why would that be?

66
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:52,524
Well, it's obvious.
l'm a Cardassian.

67
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:55,087
He's not just any Cardassian.

68
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:57,122
He's a war criminal.

69
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:07,033
So you're saying this man...
what's his name?

70
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,737
Marritza.
Aamin Marritza.

71
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:11,042
You're saying Marritza's
on the Bajorans' list

72
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:13,639
for Cardassians wanted
for war crimes?

73
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:15,310
He's not on any list

74
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,945
l've seen, Commander,
and l've got them all.

75
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:20,012
l don't care
whether he's listed or not...

76
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:21,045
Hold on, Major.

77
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,183
Marritza is traveling
on a Federation ship.

78
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:25,717
He comes here
for a medical emergency

79
00:05:25,762 --> 00:05:27,252
and we throw him
into a security cell.

80
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:28,456
l, for one, hope he's listed.

81
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:31,228
Commander, l know what l've
done isn't exactly policy

82
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:33,394
and may not even be legal,
but it's right.

83
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:35,495
All right, Major,
what do we charge him with?

84
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:38,405
l'm charging him with having
contracted Kalla-Nohra.

85
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,272
Do you want to explain
that to me?

86
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:42,743
The only way he could have
contracted that condition

87
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,872
was to have served
at the Gallitep labor camp

88
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:46,541
at the time
of the mining accident.

89
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:49,073
So, that makes him a war
criminal, just being there?

90
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:52,281
Commander, if you'd been
there 12 years ago

91
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:54,619
when we liberated that camp--

92
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:57,217
if you'd seen the things l saw--

93
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,560
all those Bajoran bodies,
starved, brutalized...

94
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:04,225
Do you know
what Cardassian policy was?

95
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:05,928
Oh, l'm not even talking
about the murder.

96
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:07,868
Murder was just the end
of the fun for them.

97
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:09,235
First came the humiliation.

98
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:12,036
Mothers raped in front
of their children

99
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:14,305
husbands beaten
until their wives

100
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:15,537
couldn't recognize them

101
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:18,479
old people buried alive because
they couldn't work anymore.

102
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:29,516
l think l'll have a talk
with our guest.

103
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,049
l'll come with you.

104
00:06:31,127 --> 00:06:32,185
No, Major.

105
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:35,686
lt'd be better
if l spoke to him alone.

106
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:47,966
How do you feel?

107
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,807
Better, thank you.

108
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:51,939
l'm Benjamin Sisko.

109
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:53,573
l'm in charge of this station.

110
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:54,913
Oh, finally.

111
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:56,646
The Federation to the rescue.

112
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:59,678
Are you going to get
me out of here?

113
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,314
l hope so.

114
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:04,758
Tell me, how did you contract
Kalla-Nohra Syndrome?

115
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:06,955
l don't have Kalla-Nohra.

116
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:08,657
l have Pottrik Syndrome.

117
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:10,791
The freighter captain said
it was Kalla-Nohra.

118
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,391
A very similar condition.

119
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:15,461
Take the same medication,
as a matter of fact.

120
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:17,871
Then you didn't serve
at the Gallitep labor camp?

121
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:19,238
Labor camp?

122
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:21,873
No.

123
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:23,879
l've never been to Bajor.

124
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:26,905
l was a military file clerk.

125
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,909
l reside now on Kora ll
where l boarded a freighter

126
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:35,048
which, unfortunately
for me, came here.

127
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:37,491
Now, Commander, if you have
no more questions

128
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:38,892
l'd like to be on my way.

129
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:40,623
Am l still drunk

130
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:44,394
or am l in jail
with a Cardassian?

131
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,832
Odo!

132
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:49,668
You're not keeping me
in here with one of those.

133
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:53,163
Odo! Odo!

134
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:57,646
l put myself in your hands,
Commander.

135
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:07,347
Let me get this straight.

136
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,255
You're saying
Marritza does have Kalla-Nohra?

137
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,691
There's no doubt about it.

138
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:11,988
He has all the symptoms.

139
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:15,156
And when l ran a lower pulmonary
bio-probe, he read positive.

140
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:17,758
And you're sure he doesn't
have Pottrik Syndrome?

141
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,767
Yes, absolutely.

142
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:19,859
lf he had Pottrik's

143
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:21,494
the bio-probe
would have been negative.

144
00:08:21,537 --> 00:08:24,870
Then he was
at the Gallitep labor camp.

145
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:26,204
Definitely.

146
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:28,733
l've cross-checked all Bajoran
and Federation medical records

147
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:30,040
and there's simply no other way

148
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:31,579
he could have gotten
this condition.

149
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:32,774
Kira to Sisko.

150
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:34,043
Yes, Major?

151
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,643
Commander, there's an incoming
transmission for you from Bajor.

152
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:38,677
lt's the Minister of State.

153
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:41,451
Thank you.
lf you'll excuse me, Doctor.

154
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:46,892
Minister Kaval.

155
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,226
Good day, sir.

156
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:49,891
And to you, Commander.

157
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:51,160
l trust you're in good health.

158
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,690
Things are going well
on the station?

159
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
Quite well, thank you.

160
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:54,997
That's wonderful.

161
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:56,800
l'm told you've performed

162
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:59,000
a special service
for Bajor today.

163
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,565
Congratulations to you.

164
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,237
l don't quite follow.

165
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:05,679
You're not holding
a certain Cardassian for us?

166
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:08,684
We are holding a Cardassian
temporarily.

167
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:11,710
By temporarily, you mean
until you are satisfied

168
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:14,222
that a verified identification
has been made.

169
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:16,225
Minister, l'm not sure
we have the grounds

170
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,317
to hold him that long.

171
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,988
l fully understand
your concerns, Commander

172
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,326
but since our Major Kira

173
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:23,662
has accepted responsibility
in this matter

174
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,462
the burden
is off your shoulders.

175
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,490
l don't agree.

176
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:27,559
Commander

177
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:29,901
if this Marritza was at Gallitep

178
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:32,430
we want him,
and we will have him.

179
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:33,772
ls that clear?

180
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,868
lt is.

181
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,879
Good.

182
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:39,938
We'll chat again soon.

183
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:41,643
Good day, Commander.

184
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,151
May l join you?

185
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:05,990
Actually, l was just about

186
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:08,496
to pay a visit to our friend,
Marritza.

187
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,158
That's what l want
to talk to you about, Major.

188
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,033
l'd like Odo to handle
this investigation.

189
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:16,037
Why?

190
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:18,232
He's our Chief of Security.

191
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:21,368
Minister Kaval put me in charge.

192
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,970
Minister Kaval
doesn't run this station.

193
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:25,344
And the Federation has no right

194
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:27,008
telling us how to deal
with our criminals.

195
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:29,176
lf it turns out
that he is a criminal

196
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:31,948
then he'll be yours,
and you're welcome to him.

197
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:34,922
Until then, he's just a traveler
under suspicion.

198
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:41,160
You think this is all

199
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:44,063
some personal vendetta
on my part, don't you?

200
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,397
l think you're too close
to be objective, yes.

201
00:10:47,436 --> 00:10:50,428
You're right.
l'm not objective.

202
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:55,068
But l'm your First Officer,
and l give you my word

203
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:57,771
l will conduct myself
accordingly.

204
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,948
You once said we were friends.

205
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:08,286
l'm asking you now,
as a friend--

206
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:13,284
please, let me conduct
this investigation.

207
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,388
l owe it to them.

208
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:18,559
You mean the victims.

209
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,568
That's right.

210
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:25,096
The ones who moved too slowly
and never moved again.

211
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:32,569
l'm asking for all the Bajorans
who can't ask.

212
00:11:32,614 --> 00:11:35,981
Let a Bajoran do this.

213
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:45,593
Sisko to Odo.

214
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:47,060
Go ahead.

215
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:50,064
Constable, Major Kira

216
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,761
will be in charge
of the Marritza investigation.

217
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:55,463
l understand.

218
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:01,065
Thank you.

219
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:15,223
Constable.

220
00:12:15,257 --> 00:12:17,225
lt's about time you let me out.

221
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:20,888
Try to stay out of trouble
for a day or two, will you?

222
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:22,726
l'll do my best.

223
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:28,101
Oh, and Odo, let me know
when you hang the Cardassian.

224
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,238
l've begun a background check
on Marritza.

225
00:12:34,276 --> 00:12:36,403
So far he is what he says he is.

226
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:39,573
He boarded that Kobheerian
freighter at Kora ll

227
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:41,913
where he's worked
as an instructor

228
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,919
at a military academy
for the past five years.

229
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,580
Keep looking.

230
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:49,318
Don't worry, Major, l intend to.

231
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:52,790
l'll be with the prisoner
if you need me.

232
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:00,827
My compliments
on your replicators, Major.

233
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:06,000
But the <i>sem'hal</i> stew
could use a little <i>yamok</i> sauce.

234
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,633
l'm glad you're enjoying it.

235
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,007
l doubt that, Major.

236
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:10,670
l doubt it very much.

237
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:12,942
l hope it won't disturb
your dinner

238
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:14,881
if l ask you a few questions.

239
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,316
lf l refuse to answer?

240
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:17,750
l'll ask them anyway.

241
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:20,380
Of course.

242
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:22,356
This is my job.

243
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:25,758
Persecuting Cardassians goes
far beyond your job, Major.

244
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:27,125
lt's your passion.

245
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:33,397
You claim you were never
at Gallitep.

246
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:35,403
l missed that honor.

247
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:38,463
And that your illness
is not Kalla-Nohra.

248
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:39,769
Again, true.

249
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:41,036
Again, false.

250
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:44,271
Our Doctor confirmed
you do have Kalla-Nohra

251
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:46,747
which means
you were at Gallitep.

252
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:49,751
lf your lies are going to be
this transparent

253
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:52,754
it's going to be
a very short interrogation.

254
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:57,248
Well, in that case, l'll try
to make my lies more opaque.

255
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:02,322
What was your rank at Gallitep?

256
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:03,831
What were your duties?

257
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,265
You don't want to know.

258
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,699
Just answer the question.

259
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:08,225
You'll be disappointed.

260
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:11,695
l'll risk it.

261
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:15,740
l had the distinction of serving

262
00:14:15,777 --> 00:14:18,746
in the exalted position
of filing clerk.

263
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,805
Filing clerk?

264
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:23,010
l told you
you'd be disappointed.

265
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:25,144
Actually, l would have preferred

266
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:27,018
to avoid military service
altogether

267
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:29,114
but l had the good fortune
to be posted

268
00:14:29,158 --> 00:14:30,648
to the records office
at Gallitep

269
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:33,183
and l turned out to be
an exemplary file clerk.

270
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:34,718
ln 14 units of service

271
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:37,027
l never misplaced
or lost a record.

272
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:39,191
l received
numerous commendations.

273
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:41,930
Gul Darhe'el, himself, called
my computer filing system

274
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,167
''a masterpiece
of meticulous exactitude.''

275
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:46,834
Well, there you are.

276
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,172
My secret's out.

277
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,008
My crimes laid bare.

278
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:53,537
l await execution.

279
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:56,050
l hope we don't
keep you waiting long.

280
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:03,651
You know, l never heard
of a filing clerk

281
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:06,661
becoming an instructor
at a military academy.

282
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:07,821
Until now.

283
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:09,160
What did you teach?

284
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:11,098
Believe it or not, filing.

285
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,600
l can verify that.

286
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:13,931
Be my guest.

287
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:16,733
l still think you're a liar.

288
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,768
So much for our search
for the truth.

289
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:22,367
Now we trade insults.

290
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:26,142
You admit
you worked under Gul Darhe'el.

291
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,012
We all did.

292
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:30,584
l take it, then,
you witnessed the atrocities.

293
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:32,177
Atrocities?

294
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:34,212
What atrocities?

295
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:41,318
Oh, l vaguely recall hearing
a scream from time to time.

296
00:15:41,363 --> 00:15:44,025
Atrocities? No.

297
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:46,033
You expect me to believe

298
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:49,593
you knew nothing of the murders,
the tortures?

299
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:51,606
You never saw the bodies?

300
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,164
Of course l saw bodies.

301
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,869
People died all the time
at Gallitep--

302
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,141
mining accidents, illnesses,
feuds among the workers.

303
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,343
You're saying
Bajorans killed each other?

304
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:02,850
At times.

305
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:06,149
Over food, a blanket, a woman.

306
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:08,656
The conditions were harsh.

307
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,158
lt was a labor camp, Major.

308
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:13,661
l helped liberate that camp.

309
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:15,492
l saw the bodies.

310
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,361
l know how they died.

311
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,629
You saw
what we wanted you to see.

312
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,465
Who do you think
started the rumors

313
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,993
about brutality at Gallitep?

314
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:25,096
lt was Gul Darhe'el himself.

315
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,471
Now, there was a leader.

316
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:28,476
Brilliant, extraordinary man.

317
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,479
He knew that to rule by fear
was to rule completely.

318
00:16:31,513 --> 00:16:34,004
Why bother
with actual mass murders

319
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:36,916
when just the reports
of such incidents

320
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,977
would have the same effect?

321
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,147
Which was?

322
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:41,815
You know as well as l do, Major.

323
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:44,724
To keep you Bajorans thinking
of yourselves as victims.

324
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,523
To keep you afraid and helpless.

325
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:50,657
Turns out
we weren't so helpless.

326
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,667
We did get rid of you.

327
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:56,569
Leaving was
a political decision, Major.

328
00:16:56,605 --> 00:16:58,835
l've enjoyed
reminiscing with you.

329
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:02,173
Now l think it's time
you let me out of here.

330
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,677
l can't do that.

331
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:05,612
Oh, no, no, no, no,
of course not.

332
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:08,616
No, you see, you're the one
who's lying now, Major.

333
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,914
lt's not the truth
you're interested in.

334
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,510
All you want is vengeance.

335
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:30,281
Commander, l was led to believe
the Federation guarantees

336
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:33,617
the safe and unrestricted
passage of all travelers

337
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:34,952
visiting your station.

338
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:36,080
That's correct.

339
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:37,352
Then, how do you explain

340
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:39,952
the detention
of a Cardassian citizen?

341
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:42,962
Marritza came here seeking
medical attention.

342
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:44,861
Right now, he's
under our Doctor's care.

343
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,368
All we're trying to do
is to verify his identity.

344
00:17:47,402 --> 00:17:50,860
A simple matter-- if you'll
give us some assistance.

345
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:54,808
l assure you, Commander,
you don't need our assistance.

346
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:58,609
lf this patient says
his name is Marritza

347
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:00,615
then that's who he is.

348
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:03,345
l hope you're not suggesting
you don't trust him

349
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:05,580
simply because he's Cardassian.

350
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,713
l don't trust him
because he's already lied

351
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:08,916
about being at Gallitep.

352
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,517
ls that what you're charging him
with, Commander?

353
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:13,858
Lying?

354
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:16,728
So far, we haven't charged him
with anything.

355
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:18,062
Then let him go.

356
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,726
l'd like nothing better.

357
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:22,498
But first, l need to know
who it is l'm letting go.

358
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:24,835
l do appreciate

359
00:18:24,873 --> 00:18:28,570
the awkwardness of your position
here, Commander.

360
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,443
This Bajoran obsession

361
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:35,040
with alleged
Cardassian improprieties

362
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:39,543
during the occupation
is really quite distasteful.

363
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:42,682
l suppose, if you're a Bajoran,
so was the occupation.

364
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:44,191
l might remind you

365
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:46,751
that neither one
of us is Bajoran

366
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:49,593
and l would hate
their bitterness

367
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:53,931
to cause conflict between
Cardassia and the Federation.

368
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:57,700
l hope to avoid that, too--
with your help.

369
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:59,297
You don't need my help

370
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:03,573
to safeguard one Cardassian
citizen on your station.

371
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:06,445
lf any of these
Bajoran hate mongers

372
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:09,109
get their hands on him

373
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,177
l'll hold you
personally responsible.

374
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:31,465
What are you looking for?

375
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:34,942
Answers.

376
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,137
Found any yet?

377
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:42,646
Marritza says l don't care
about the truth.

378
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:45,312
That all l want is vengeance.

379
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:49,312
Are you worried
that maybe he's right?

380
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:54,317
All l want
is to see him punished.

381
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:57,820
Even if he is just a file clerk?

382
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:58,958
That's just it.

383
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:01,662
l don't want him
to be just a file clerk.

384
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:02,863
l want him to be--

385
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:04,997
l don't know--
something worse.

386
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:09,969
You want him to be guilty.

387
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,672
As far as l'm concerned

388
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:14,181
if he was at Gallitep,
he is guilty.

389
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,842
They're all guilty.

390
00:20:15,884 --> 00:20:22,517
His punishment
will let Bajor feel some...

391
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:25,355
satisfaction.

392
00:20:25,393 --> 00:20:28,362
lt sounds like
you're trying too hard

393
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:30,864
to believe what you're saying.

394
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:34,528
You already know,
if you punish him without reason

395
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,196
it won't mean anything.

396
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:39,798
And you already know
vengeance...

397
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:41,672
isn't enough.

398
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,728
Reroute the signal
enhancement module

399
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:03,390
to the main sensor array.

400
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:04,921
Aye, sir.

401
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:10,664
How's it look?

402
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:12,332
Just give me a second.

403
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:14,365
l'll run a diagnostic.

404
00:21:16,478 --> 00:21:18,776
l've checked
with the Bajoran Archives

405
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:20,940
and they do have
a Marritza on record

406
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:23,280
as being a filing clerk
at Gallitep.

407
00:21:23,318 --> 00:21:25,616
l've also checked with the
military academy on Kora ll.

408
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:27,951
Marritza has been
teaching filing there

409
00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:29,115
just as he claims.

410
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:30,317
All set, Commander.

411
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:32,826
Major, how many images were sent
from the Bajoran archives?

412
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:33,987
Only one.

413
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:36,327
lt's the only picture
they could find of Gallitep

414
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:37,490
that had Marritza in it.

415
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:38,726
The Cardassians destroyed

416
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:40,496
almost all records
of the occupation.

417
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:42,503
The image enhancement
and transformation functions

418
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:44,095
are patched directly
into your console.

419
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:47,603
Major, what if this image
confirms

420
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:49,234
that Marritza was a file clerk?

421
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:51,677
What do you expect us
to do then?

422
00:21:51,713 --> 00:21:53,772
l suppose you'll let him go.

423
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:55,680
l'm glad we understand
each other.

424
00:21:55,717 --> 00:21:56,684
l've got it.

425
00:21:56,718 --> 00:21:58,515
On screen.

426
00:21:58,553 --> 00:21:59,986
Which one is Marritza?

427
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:01,818
Let's see... according
to the caption

428
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:03,881
he's the one
in the background

429
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:05,222
in the far right.

430
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,194
lsolate and magnify.

431
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:12,630
You're going to have
to do better than that.

432
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:13,634
Give me a minute.

433
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:16,102
l'm running an image
enhancement sequence.

434
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:22,400
lt's not him.

435
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:25,572
Are you sure
we're looking at the right man?

436
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:28,514
Background, far right,
Aamin Marritza.

437
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,745
lt can't be.

438
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:33,777
lf that's Marritza,
then who are we holding here?

439
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:40,857
Lieutenant,
isolate the Cardassians

440
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:42,419
in the foreground.

441
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:46,662
The one in profile on the left--
what can you give us?

442
00:22:56,778 --> 00:22:58,678
That's him.
That's Marritza.

443
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:00,578
Not according to the caption.

444
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:01,639
What do you mean?

445
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:05,084
According to this,
it's Gul Darhe'el.

446
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:12,853
Let me guess.

447
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:15,920
You've come back to learn
the secret of my filing system.

448
00:23:15,964 --> 00:23:18,228
l know all your secrets now.

449
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,233
ls that so?

450
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,234
What did you do?

451
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:22,429
Did you kill the real Marritza

452
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,495
so you could take his place?

453
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,837
Well, you'll pay for that death

454
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,969
and all the others
you're responsible for.

455
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:32,512
Oh, l don't think l could pay
for all of them, Major--

456
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:34,981
there were so many-- and you
can only execute me once.

457
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,210
That's my only regret.

458
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:41,586
But... l'll settle for knowing
that Bajor will finally have

459
00:23:41,623 --> 00:23:45,582
the satisfaction of punishing
the Butcher of Gallitep.

460
00:23:45,627 --> 00:23:47,424
Tell me, Major.

461
00:23:47,462 --> 00:23:50,260
Did you figure this out
all by yourself?

462
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:53,927
Or did you have help
from your Federation masters?

463
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:56,198
l'll let you
wonder about that.

464
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:57,329
lt'll keep you occupied

465
00:23:57,372 --> 00:23:59,465
while we're waiting
for the provisional government

466
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:01,907
to prepare
your war crimes tribunal.

467
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:03,376
War crimes?

468
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:05,879
How could there be war crimes

469
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:07,814
when there hasn't been a war?

470
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:11,307
l can understand your wish
that there had been a war.

471
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:14,150
Your need to indulge
some pathetic fantasy

472
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:18,148
about brave Bajoran soldiers
marching to honorable defeat.

473
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:19,160
But, in fact, Major

474
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:21,162
you and l know
there was no war, no glory.

475
00:24:21,196 --> 00:24:23,824
Bajor didn't resist.

476
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:25,662
lt surrendered.

477
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,725
The Bajorans were a peaceful
people before you came.

478
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:28,929
We offered no threat to you.

479
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,235
We could never understand
why you had to be so brutal.

480
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:33,672
Well, we can't have that, Major.

481
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,175
l want no more secrets
between us.

482
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,440
Anything you don't understand
l'll explain to you.

483
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:39,708
Thank you, but l think
l've heard enough of your lies.

484
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:40,805
What lies?

485
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:42,975
You mean my failure
to divulge my true identity?

486
00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:45,178
Believe me, Major,
l yearned to tell you

487
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,950
but l knew how much more
satisfaction you would have

488
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:49,354
if you found out for yourself.

489
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,823
And that was my only deception.

490
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:52,519
Marritza was
a magnificent file clerk

491
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,891
and l, Gul Darhe'el--

492
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:57,125
l hope you'll not think it
immodest of me to say so--

493
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:59,190
but l was a magnificent leader.

494
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:01,668
Oh, you never saw Gallitep
at its height.

495
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:02,931
For a labor camp

496
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:05,371
it was the very model
of order and efficiency.

497
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:06,532
And why?

498
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:08,701
For that, you have
to look to the top.

499
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:09,767
To me!

500
00:25:09,811 --> 00:25:12,644
My word,
my every glance was law

501
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,274
and the verdict
was always the same-- guilty.

502
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:16,613
You're insane.

503
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:18,118
Oh, no, no, Major.

504
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:20,279
You can't dismiss me
that easily.

505
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:22,118
l did what had to be done.

506
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:25,751
My men understood that,
and that's why they loved me.

507
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:28,421
l would order them to go out
and kill Bajoran scum

508
00:25:28,463 --> 00:25:30,863
and they'd do it,
they'd murder them

509
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:34,857
and they'd come back covered
in blood, but they felt clean.

510
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:37,700
Now, why did they feel
that way, Major?

511
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:39,536
Because they were clean.

512
00:25:39,574 --> 00:25:41,235
You admit your atrocities.

513
00:25:41,276 --> 00:25:43,369
l admit everything.

514
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:46,107
Why not?
l was the best at what l did.

515
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:48,411
My accomplishments
speak for themselves.

516
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:49,643
Can you say the same?

517
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:52,482
You and that little Shakaar
resistance cell

518
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,646
that you belonged to.

519
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:55,485
All you did was
annoy Cardassians

520
00:25:55,523 --> 00:25:57,650
while l was out
exterminating Bajorans.

521
00:25:57,692 --> 00:25:59,785
Make sure you tell that
to the tribunal.

522
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:01,089
Oh, l will.

523
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:02,790
Then they'll sentence you
to death.

524
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,797
Let them.

525
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:06,299
Don't you see, it doesn't
change anything?

526
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:08,928
Kill me, torture me--
it doesn't matter.

527
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,597
You've already lost, Major.

528
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:13,198
You can never undo
what l've accomplished.

529
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:15,038
The dead will still be dead.

530
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:19,646
What will you do now, Major?

531
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:21,672
Withhold my medicine?

532
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:43,577
Here.

533
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:44,915
This will help.

534
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:46,079
What is it?

535
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,748
Maraltian <i>seev-ale</i>

536
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:50,121
from Quark's private stock.

537
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:56,690
Better?

538
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:58,563
You know, Odo

539
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,296
l wonder how many others
like Darhe'el

540
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:02,860
are still out there...

541
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,598
still free, unpunished.

542
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:06,539
Quite a few, no doubt

543
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:10,875
but thanks to you,
there's one less out there now.

544
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:13,140
You should have heard him.

545
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:16,776
He bragged about
what happened at Gallitep--

546
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:20,254
the torture, the murders,
the humiliation.

547
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:23,155
He's proud
about what he did to us.

548
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:25,159
Why don't you go
to your quarters

549
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:27,184
and lie down for a while?

550
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,164
We'll leave him alone
with his Cardassian pride.

551
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:31,893
l don't want to lie down.

552
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,865
No, that's what he'd like--

553
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,370
another Bajoran
hiding in a corner.

554
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,373
He's probably in there
laughing at me right now.

555
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,671
He won't be laughing very long.

556
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,575
l hate him, Odo.

557
00:27:43,612 --> 00:27:48,413
l hate his smirking,
superior Cardassian face.

558
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,918
When l was fighting
with the resistance

559
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:52,852
we used to lie awake at night

560
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:56,016
plotting the assassination
of men like Darhe'el.

561
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:58,355
Now l have to stand there
and listen to him

562
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:01,055
belittle the Shakaar
and everything it stood for.

563
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,055
Perhaps you should avoid
discussing your personal history

564
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,567
with a creature like that.

565
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,569
l didn't.

566
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,972
Then how did he know
you were with the Shakaar?

567
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:16,569
l don't know...

568
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,876
he was an important
military leader.

569
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:21,780
That doesn't explain it.

570
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:25,981
lf he'd been in charge
of quelling Bajoran resistance

571
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:29,184
then he might have had
your name on file

572
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:32,057
but he commanded
a forced labor camp.

573
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:34,254
Something's not right here.

574
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:38,733
Where are you going?

575
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:41,759
To have another little chat
with Gul Darhe'el.

576
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:50,169
Computer, review
all off-station requests

577
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:53,375
for information regarding
Major Kira Nerys

578
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:55,679
within the last eight months.

579
00:28:55,717 --> 00:28:56,877
Working.

580
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:58,886
Oh, back to see the Butcher.

581
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,649
Am l really so fascinating?

582
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:04,056
How did you know
l was with the Shakaar?

583
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:07,694
This provisional
government of yours

584
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:09,128
certainly moves slowly.

585
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,496
They should have dragged me
away in chains by now.

586
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:12,864
Just answer the question!

587
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:16,200
Oh, my, my, you are
a strutting little egotist.

588
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:20,140
You forget the brilliance
of Marritza's filing system.

589
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,234
He made sure that l was provided
with information

590
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:24,541
on all your little
terrorist bands.

591
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:27,707
What l particularly enjoyed
were the termination reports.

592
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:32,812
Yes, life in a forced labor camp
can be so isolating.

593
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,515
At times, l felt that l alone

594
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:37,354
bore the burden of cleansing
Bajor of its rabble

595
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:41,328
but those reports reassured me,
l was not alone.

596
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,298
And l'm supposed to believe
you remembered my name

597
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:46,527
from some report
you read years ago?

598
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:51,536
At the risk of bruising
your vanity even further, Major

599
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:55,100
l didn't remember you at all
until l heard your name here.

600
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:57,236
l can see that disturbs you.

601
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,746
Hardly.

602
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,647
You know, Major,
they will be coming for me soon

603
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:03,150
so before we say good-bye

604
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:06,017
there are a few little questions
l should like to ask you.

605
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,352
Your questions
don't interest me.

606
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,654
How can you be so sure?

607
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:13,718
Or are you just
afraid to hear them?

608
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:39,286
Who are they?

609
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:41,881
Survivors of Gallitep.

610
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,891
They arrived early this morning.

611
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,621
l suppose they are waiting
for justice.

612
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:47,787
Gallitep.

613
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:50,798
lmagine living
through that hellhole.

614
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:52,060
The pain...

615
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,399
the sorrow...

616
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,099
Do you think
they like to gamble?

617
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,148
Doctor, l need your help.

618
00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:11,243
Of course.

619
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,414
Three months ago,
a request came from Kora ll

620
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,924
for information
concerning Kira Nerys.

621
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,924
To what purpose?

622
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:19,119
l'm not sure.

623
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,425
But the name on the request
was Aamin Marritza.

624
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,831
l've established
a subspace link with Kora ll

625
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:29,394
and l'd like you to access
his medical history there.

626
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:30,802
Dax to Odo.

627
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:34,434
Gul Dukat is responding
to your subspace transmission.

628
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,773
Could you route it
to my office?

629
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,799
Aye, sir.

630
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:41,776
l do miss working with you, Odo.

631
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:45,582
l miss our games
of Kalevian montar.

632
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,783
As l recall, Gul Dukat,
we played one game

633
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,154
and you cheated.

634
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:55,953
The same old Odo--

635
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:59,397
like a blunt instrument.

636
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:01,561
But now to your question.

637
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:06,063
l regret that l cannot give you
access to any of the files

638
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:08,405
pertaining to Gul Darhe'el.

639
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:09,774
But l assure you

640
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:13,747
the files would only tell you
what l am telling you.

641
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:16,250
Gul Darhe'el is dead.

642
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:19,014
That's not possible.

643
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:21,454
l attended his funeral myself.

644
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:24,083
As a matter of fact, he's buried

645
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:28,789
under one of the largest
military monuments on Cardassia.

646
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,594
Then who are we holding here?

647
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:34,625
Some innocent
Cardassian citizen

648
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:37,638
as l explained
to your Commander Sisko.

649
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:39,765
And we want him released.

650
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:41,503
That innocent citizen

651
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:45,070
has admitted he is Gul Darhe'el.

652
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:49,846
What... are you saying?

653
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:54,947
He says
his name is Gul Darhe'el.

654
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:56,786
Then he's lying.

655
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,520
Well, if he is,
it's the most foolish lie

656
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,527
he could have invented.

657
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,960
lt's likely to get him executed.

658
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:02,724
Why would anyone
do such a thing?

659
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:03,890
l don't know

660
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:07,798
but l tell you
l attended Darhe'el's funeral.

661
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:11,863
You're sure the man
you saw buried was Gul Darhe'el?

662
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:15,467
Half of Cardassia
viewed his body.

663
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,444
l saw a photograph
of Gul Darhe'el

664
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:19,447
taken at the Gallitep
labor camp.

665
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:21,745
lt certainly appears to be
the man we're holding.

666
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:23,080
You're mistaken.

667
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:24,142
Am l?

668
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:26,085
This is obviously some plot

669
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:28,646
to embarrass
the Cardassian Empire.

670
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,523
lt's possible.

671
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,027
Give me access to your files

672
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:35,927
and perhaps l can find
some proof

673
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:39,592
to support your claim
that Gul Darhe'el is dead.

674
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:49,372
l suppose l could grant you
limited access to the files.

675
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:53,608
l think that's wise.

676
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:00,121
l was 12
when l started fighting

677
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:02,646
but l've heard of some
who were even younger than that.

678
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,181
Yes, yes,
let's get to the real issue!

679
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:08,218
How many Cardassians
did you kill?

680
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:09,890
l mean personally.

681
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:12,525
l didn't keep count.

682
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:13,761
Oh, l think you did.

683
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,031
And l'm sure your total
wasn't limited

684
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,401
to military personnel.

685
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:20,168
After all, the most effective
terrorist weapon

686
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,436
was random violence.

687
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,773
Don't leave now, Major.

688
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,175
lt's just getting good.

689
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:26,737
How many Cardassian
civilians did you kill?

690
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:30,239
Look! l regret a lot
of what l had to do.

691
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:31,479
How convenient of you.

692
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,749
We had no choice!
We were fighting for survival.

693
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:34,812
So were we.

694
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:36,915
We had an Empire to protect.

695
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,585
We needed your resources.

696
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:39,752
Everything l did

697
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:42,262
was for the greater glory
of Cardassia!

698
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:45,266
And if you spineless scum
had to be ground under

699
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,528
so much the better.

700
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,661
All that mattered was Cardassia.

701
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:49,931
l loved my homeland.

702
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:51,802
That's what justified
my actions.

703
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,898
That's what gave me strength.

704
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:56,934
Nothing justifies genocide.

705
00:34:57,045 --> 00:35:01,038
What you call genocide,
l call a day's work.

706
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:07,248
Major, could l have
a word with you?

707
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:22,866
Dr. Bashir and l have
done some checking.

708
00:35:22,904 --> 00:35:24,531
l don't know why yet

709
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:29,669
but the man in that cell
wanted to be caught.

710
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:43,753
This certificate of death

711
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:46,726
was in the file sent
to me by Gul Dukat.

712
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,719
According to this, Gul Darhe'el
died in his sleep six years ago.

713
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:53,562
''Cause of death--
massive coleibric hemorrhage.''

714
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,626
Commander, l guarantee you
that is a forged document.

715
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,729
l think it's pretty clear
what's going on here.

716
00:35:58,772 --> 00:36:01,070
The Cardassians
are trying to trick us

717
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:02,336
into letting him go.

718
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:04,401
l wouldn't put it past
our friend Gul Dukat.

719
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:06,709
Nor would l, however...

720
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,205
The man in there confessed
he is Gul Darhe'el.

721
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,515
Major, the man in there
has Kalla-Nohra syndrome.

722
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:15,044
Of course he does.

723
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,455
According to the evidence
l've been sent

724
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:20,221
Gul Darhe'el
never contracted that condition.

725
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,661
More evidence
from our trustworthy Gul Dukat.

726
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:27,627
What have you got, Constable?

727
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:30,262
Darhe'el's progress reports
from Gallitep

728
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:33,000
show that, when
the mining accident occurred

729
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,564
he was back on Cardassia

730
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:37,441
being awarded the Proficient
Service Medallion.

731
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:40,538
lf he wasn't at Gallitep
on the day on the accident

732
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:43,243
then he couldn't have contracted
Kalla-Nohra.

733
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:44,250
Correct.

734
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:47,981
But the man we're holding
does have it.

735
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:50,649
l can't believe
l'm listening to this.

736
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:52,886
l'm afraid there's more, Major.

737
00:36:52,926 --> 00:36:56,623
l inquired about this man's
last two weeks on Kora ll.

738
00:36:56,663 --> 00:36:59,530
He resigned his position
at the military academy

739
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:01,033
put all his affairs in order

740
00:37:01,068 --> 00:37:03,502
and even provided handsomely
for his housekeeper

741
00:37:03,537 --> 00:37:04,834
l understand.

742
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:06,166
All right, all right.

743
00:37:06,206 --> 00:37:08,504
So, like any criminal,
he wanted to move on

744
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,840
before somebody traced
his whereabouts.

745
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:13,108
He specifically
requested passage

746
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,241
on a vessel that was scheduled
to stop here--

747
00:37:16,283 --> 00:37:17,750
at a Bajoran station.

748
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:21,482
Rather unusual request
for a Cardassian war criminal.

749
00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:24,582
Unless he wanted to be captured.

750
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:25,853
Wait a minute.

751
00:37:25,926 --> 00:37:27,826
Let's be clear about one thing.

752
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:30,989
This evidence may raise
some interesting questions.

753
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:34,489
Nevertheless, Darhe'el is going
to be sent back to Bajor

754
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:37,436
to stand trial
for the atrocities he committed.

755
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:39,496
Major, that is still
to be determined.

756
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,337
Well, then go talk to him.

757
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:45,607
lf you still have any doubts,
listen to what he has to say.

758
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:47,443
He was there.
He did it.

759
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:49,108
He'll tell you about it.

760
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:54,986
Constable, l've checked
on Marritza's medical record.

761
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,250
What have we got?

762
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,382
He's under treatment

763
00:37:57,424 --> 00:37:59,289
for Kalla-Nohra
syndrome, of course

764
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:02,352
and a few other minor ailments,
most relating to his age.

765
00:38:02,396 --> 00:38:05,331
lt's all pretty standard,
really, except for one thing.

766
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:06,491
Which is...?

767
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:10,094
Five years ago,
after arriving on Kora ll

768
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:14,301
he started taking massive doses
of dermatiraelian plastiscine

769
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,275
which is a dermal
regenerative agent

770
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,073
used to maintain
skin resilience

771
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:21,376
after cosmetic alteration.

772
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:25,745
You're saying
he changed his face

773
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:27,583
to look like Gul Darhe'el.

774
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:29,885
lt certainly appears that way.

775
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:44,134
How are you feeling?

776
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:45,433
l was starting to get
a little bored

777
00:38:45,472 --> 00:38:47,963
but seeing you again
brightens my day.

778
00:38:48,008 --> 00:38:50,875
l was referring
to your Kalla-Nohra Syndrome.

779
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,880
Would you like to see
Dr. Bashir?

780
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,074
Oh, so that's it.

781
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:58,278
You want to see me writhing
around the floor in pain.

782
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:00,115
A Cardassian would never put on

783
00:39:00,153 --> 00:39:02,644
such a deplorable display
in front of a Bajoran.

784
00:39:02,689 --> 00:39:04,589
You just don't
understand us at all.

785
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:08,152
l'm beginning to understand
a great deal about you.

786
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:09,958
One thing does puzzle me.

787
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:11,555
And what would that be?

788
00:39:11,598 --> 00:39:14,567
How you contracted
Kalla-Nohra Syndrome.

789
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,592
Do you think
that the mining accident

790
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:18,468
affected only
the Bajoran laborers

791
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:20,268
and not
their Cardassian masters?

792
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:21,638
That would be very nice.

793
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:23,267
So you're saying
you were at Gallitep

794
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,834
when that mining accident
occurred.

795
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:25,845
Of course.

796
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,471
Why are we going over
this again?

797
00:39:27,514 --> 00:39:29,482
Because your own progress report

798
00:39:29,516 --> 00:39:32,110
shows you were back on Cardassia
at the time of the accident.

799
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:33,414
That's ridiculous.

800
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:36,354
Receiving your
Proficient Service Medallion.

801
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,823
The reports are wrong.

802
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:39,223
l can show them to you.

803
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:40,453
That won't be necessary.

804
00:39:40,494 --> 00:39:41,688
l know where l was.

805
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:44,356
Why were you taking
a dermal regenerative?

806
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:46,696
l don't know
what you're talking about.

807
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:47,995
Then let me help you.

808
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:51,436
Five years ago,
when you first got to Kora ll...

809
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:52,438
All right, that's enough!

810
00:39:52,472 --> 00:39:54,133
Your presence no longer
amuses me. Get out!

811
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,505
Why did you have
your face altered?

812
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:56,975
Security, get this woman
out of here!

813
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,706
Why are you pretending
to be Gul Darhe'el?

814
00:39:59,746 --> 00:40:02,340
Why don't you ask me
something intelligent?!

815
00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:03,508
As for instance, how did l feel

816
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,643
when we were withdrawing
from Bajor?

817
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:07,381
The answer is l was furious.

818
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:09,981
The thought of leaving
any survivors behind

819
00:40:10,023 --> 00:40:11,217
was repulsive to me.

820
00:40:11,258 --> 00:40:13,283
So while our useless
office clerks

821
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,988
were packing
their precious files

822
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:16,893
l ordered my overseers

823
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,865
to begin slaughtering
the laborers.

824
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,494
lf you felt that way
about your filing clerks

825
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:24,003
why did you take
Marritza's name?

826
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:25,902
My plan was to do nothing less

827
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:28,168
than kill every Bajoran
in the camp

828
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:31,609
and, to this day, my one regret
is that l was not able

829
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:33,772
to accomplish
this honorable goal.

830
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:36,908
You're Marritza, aren't you?

831
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,578
You mistake me for that bug?

832
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:41,246
That whimpering nothing?

833
00:40:41,288 --> 00:40:43,222
Oh, you stupid Bajoran girl.

834
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:44,917
Don't you know who l am?

835
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,448
l'm your nemesis.

836
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:48,051
l'm your nightmare.

837
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:50,393
l'm the Butcher of Gallitep.

838
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,490
The Butcher of Gallitep
died six years ago.

839
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:56,502
You're Aamin Marritza,
his filing clerk.

840
00:40:56,536 --> 00:40:57,764
That's not true.

841
00:40:57,804 --> 00:40:58,828
l am alive.

842
00:40:58,872 --> 00:41:01,397
l will always be alive!

843
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:03,875
lt's Marritza who is dead.

844
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:06,572
Marritza,
who was good for nothing

845
00:41:06,613 --> 00:41:10,811
but cowering under his bunk
and weeping like a woman.

846
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:14,048
Who, every night,
covered his ears

847
00:41:14,087 --> 00:41:17,022
because he couldn't bear to hear

848
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:20,686
the screaming for mercy
of the Bajorans.

849
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:39,676
Covered my ears every night,
but...

850
00:41:39,713 --> 00:41:43,706
l couldn't bear to hear
those horrible screams.

851
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,880
You have no idea
what it's like to be a coward...

852
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:51,049
to see these horrors...

853
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,683
and do nothing.

854
00:41:52,726 --> 00:41:54,023
Marritza's dead.

855
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:56,086
He deserves to be dead.

856
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:04,370
What are you doing?

857
00:42:04,404 --> 00:42:07,134
l'm letting you go.

858
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:09,369
Security?

859
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:11,070
Get in here.

860
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:17,409
You didn't commit those crimes

861
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,419
and you couldn't stop them.

862
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,182
You were only one man.

863
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:22,654
No, no, don't you see?

864
00:42:22,689 --> 00:42:24,122
l have to be punished.

865
00:42:24,157 --> 00:42:25,886
We all have to be punished.

866
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:28,484
Major, you have
to go out and tell them

867
00:42:28,528 --> 00:42:29,620
l'm Gul Darhe'el.

868
00:42:29,663 --> 00:42:30,857
lt's the only way.

869
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:34,298
Why are you doing this?

870
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:35,767
For Cardassia.

871
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:37,702
Cardassia will only survive

872
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:41,366
if it stands in front of Bajor
and admits the truth.

873
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:45,504
My trial will force Cardassia
to acknowledge its guilt

874
00:42:45,545 --> 00:42:48,207
and we're guilty, all of us.

875
00:42:48,248 --> 00:42:51,513
My death is necessary.

876
00:42:53,453 --> 00:42:57,082
What you're asking for
is another murder.

877
00:42:57,124 --> 00:43:02,084
Enough good people
have already died.

878
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:04,973
l won't help kill another.

879
00:43:19,921 --> 00:43:23,152
You should be back on Kora ll
in three days.

880
00:43:23,191 --> 00:43:25,955
Well, there's nothing
for me to go back to.

881
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:28,121
We've contacted officials there.

882
00:43:28,163 --> 00:43:30,222
They'll be waiting to help you.

883
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:32,961
lf they believed
that l was Gul Darhe'el

884
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:37,165
then my trial might have helped
to bring about a new Cardassia.

885
00:43:37,205 --> 00:43:40,231
Now you've told them
l was just a file clerk.

886
00:43:40,275 --> 00:43:43,005
What you tried to do
was very honorable.

887
00:43:43,044 --> 00:43:45,308
lf Cardassia is going to change

888
00:43:45,346 --> 00:43:47,746
it's going to need
people like you.

889
00:44:02,463 --> 00:44:03,589
Why?!

890
00:44:03,631 --> 00:44:05,656
He wasn't Darhe'el!
Why?!

891
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,224
He's a Cardassian!

892
00:44:07,268 --> 00:44:09,099
That's reason enough.

893
00:44:09,137 --> 00:44:10,729
No!

894
00:44:13,842 --> 00:44:16,310
lt's not.
