1
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:20,472
lt's Dr. Bashir, isn't it?

2
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:22,172
Of course it is.

3
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:24,579
May l introduce myself?

4
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,674
Uh... yes.

5
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:27,741
Yes, of course.

6
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:29,446
My name is Garak.

7
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,149
A Cardassian by birth,
obviously.

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,022
The only one of us left
on this station

9
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:36,526
as a matter of fact.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,189
So l do appreciate making
new friends whenever l can.

11
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:43,858
You are new to the station,
l believe.

12
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:45,892
l am, yes.

13
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,204
Though...
though l understand

14
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:52,209
you've been here quite a while.

15
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:54,609
Ah. You know of me then.

16
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:57,205
Would you care
for some of this Tarkalean tea?

17
00:00:57,248 --> 00:00:58,408
lt's very good.

18
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:01,043
What a thoughtful young man.

19
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:03,349
How nice that we've met.

20
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,654
You know...

21
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:10,990
some people say
that you remained on DS9

22
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:14,429
as the eyes and ears
of your fellow Cardassians.

23
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:15,727
You don't say.

24
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:20,336
Doctor-- you're not intimating

25
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,669
that l'm some sort of spy,
are you?

26
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:25,504
l wouldn't know, sir.

27
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,841
Ah. An open mind--

28
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:30,642
the essence of intellect.

29
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:32,410
As you may also know

30
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,509
l have a clothing shop nearby

31
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,020
so if you should
require any apparel

32
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:38,681
or simply wish, as l do

33
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:41,748
for a bit of enjoyable
company now and then

34
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:45,023
l'm at your disposal, Doctor.

35
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:47,530
You're very kind, Mr. Garak.

36
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:51,729
Oh, it's just Garak--
plain, simple...

37
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:53,236
-Garak.
-Garak.

38
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:56,898
Now, good day to you, Doctor.

39
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:03,679
l'm so glad to have made

40
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:06,512
such an interesting
new friend today.

41
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,257
You won't believe
who just sat down

42
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:20,661
next to me in the Replimat.

43
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:21,858
Major, Upper Pylon 3

44
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:24,663
will be shut down for
maintenance for 48 hours.

45
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:26,829
The spy.

46
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:28,338
Garak, the Cardassian.

47
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:29,339
We don't know for a fact

48
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:30,431
Garak's a spy, Doctor.

49
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,738
He is.
You should have heard him.

50
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:34,368
He-He introduced himself

51
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:36,845
and, and, and he struck up
conversation just like that.

52
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:38,178
He was making contact with me.

53
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:39,375
With me, of
all people.

54
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,112
What do you think
he might want from you, Julian?

55
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:45,014
l don't know...

56
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:47,182
Federation medical secrets.

57
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:49,351
Rest assured, they're safe
with me, Commander.

58
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:50,690
l'm sure they are, Dr. Bashir.

59
00:02:50,728 --> 00:02:52,195
ln fact, Chief O'Brien

60
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:54,857
l think you should place
a monitoring device on me.

61
00:02:57,902 --> 00:03:00,029
Well, just in case...

62
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,037
he...

63
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:02,902
he's up to something?

64
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,430
l don't think that will be
necessary, Doctor.

65
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,533
Just be very cautious when...

66
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:08,306
Commander, we have a small craft
taking evasive action.

67
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:10,472
Cardassian war vessel
in pursuit.

68
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:11,845
On screen.

69
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:17,146
That's Bajoran.

70
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:20,712
That damned Cardassian's
firing at a Bajoran scout ship

71
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:22,282
in Bajoran space.

72
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:23,350
Mr. O'Brien?

73
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:24,361
Confirmed, sir.

74
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,158
They've crossed
into Bajoran space.

75
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,165
Open a hailing frequency
to the Cardassians.

76
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,530
Channel open.

77
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:33,935
Cardassian vessel,
you are violating Bajoran space.

78
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:35,700
Break off your pursuit.

79
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,401
Repeat: break off now.

80
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:40,808
No reply from the Cardassians.

81
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:43,005
Bajoran vessel is hailing us.

82
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:44,275
Open the channel.

83
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:46,840
Space station, do you read?

84
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:48,010
Space station...

85
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:49,849
We can only get audio,
Commander.

86
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:51,149
This is Benjamin Sisko

87
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:53,179
Starfleet Commander
of the station.

88
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:54,383
Who are you?

89
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:56,359
Why are they pursuing?

90
00:03:56,393 --> 00:03:59,829
Please! Repeating request
for emergency docking. Please!

91
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:03,128
The Bajoran scout ship
is badly damaged.

92
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,133
Structural integrity is failing.

93
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:07,397
He's breaking up.

94
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:08,871
Get him out, Mr. O'Brien.

95
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:10,498
Aye, sir.

96
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:19,006
Medical assistance to Ops.

97
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:23,820
My name is Tahna Los.

98
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:27,255
Request political asylum.

99
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,191
Kira?

100
00:06:29,964 --> 00:06:31,761
His name is Tahna Los.

101
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:33,790
We fought together
in the underground.

102
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:36,065
Commander, the Cardassians
are hailing us.

103
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,435
Now they want to talk.

104
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:39,440
They're hopping mad.

105
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:41,635
Open the channel, Mr. O'Brien.

106
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:43,371
Federation Commander

107
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:46,278
you have taken aboard
a known criminal.

108
00:06:46,314 --> 00:06:48,509
You will turn him over to us.

109
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:50,312
He has requested asylum.

110
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:52,285
You have not granted it?

111
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,878
To be honest,
l haven't decided yet.

112
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:55,548
He is <i>Kohn-Ma.</i>

113
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,616
Not even the Bajorans
would grant his kind asylum.

114
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:03,289
He has committed heinous crimes
against the Cardassian people

115
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:04,559
and l demand

116
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,464
that you release him
to our custody.

117
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,298
l'll investigate the matter
immediately.

118
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,497
ln the interim, if you care
to dock your vessel

119
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:12,062
l'll be glad
to hear an explanation

120
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,630
for having violated
Bajoran space

121
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:16,074
and threatened
a Federation facility.

122
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:19,476
We have made no threat
to your facility.

123
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:21,482
l stand corrected.

124
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:23,211
Sisko out.

125
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:27,483
The Major and l
will be at the lnfirmary.

126
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:29,990
l'd like some time to talk
with this fellow Tahna.

127
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:31,491
When Gul Danar comes in

128
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:34,984
it would be nice if we had
a few docking regulations

129
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,997
to keep him outside a while.

130
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:38,862
Understood.

131
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:48,337
You're not seriously considering

132
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:51,106
handing Tahna over
to the Cardassians?

133
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:53,340
Were you part of
this <i>Kohn-Ma,</i> Major?

134
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,849
lf l had been,
l would not be working

135
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:58,010
with the provisional
government now.

136
00:07:58,052 --> 00:07:59,280
No, you'd still be out there

137
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,288
murdering Cardassians,
or even some Bajoran

138
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:02,812
that the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>
hold in contempt.

139
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,051
Didn't they claim responsibility

140
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,056
for the assassination

141
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,150
of one of your First Ministers
last month?

142
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,295
Look, l know Tahna.

143
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:12,959
ls he <i>Kohn-Ma?</i>

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,797
Yes, but...

145
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:17,065
l suggest you get your
priorities straight, Major

146
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:19,469
because l don't have any
room for divided loyalties

147
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:20,633
in this command

148
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:22,802
and l won't have
a <i>Kohn-Ma</i> terrorist

149
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:24,811
using this station
as a protective shield

150
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:26,574
for continuing violence.

151
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:28,479
My priorities are straight,
Commander.

152
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:30,074
Let's not be confused here.

153
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:31,811
My loyalties are to Bajor

154
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:34,082
and Bajor needs men
like Tahna Los.

155
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:36,816
Apparently, his war with the
Cardassians isn't over yet.

156
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:38,654
lf Bajor is ever to rebuild

157
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:40,820
a strong and independent
society

158
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:42,988
it will require the repatriation

159
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,328
of splinter groups
like the <i>Kohn-Ma.</i>

160
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:48,096
You have-- we have--
an opportunity here, Commander.

161
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:50,033
l hope you don't miss it.

162
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:04,596
How is he?

163
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:06,434
Second-degree burns, lacerations

164
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:07,803
a minor concussion.

165
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,037
Not much compared to what
he's been through before.

166
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:12,771
Before?

167
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:14,803
The most recent of these scars

168
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:17,407
is only two,
perhaps three years old.

169
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:20,943
Two and a half, actually.

170
00:09:20,987 --> 00:09:23,615
lt's remarkable you
lived through this.

171
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:27,615
lt's a Cardassian technique
designed to keep you alive.

172
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:31,463
l'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.

173
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:33,465
l have a few questions
for you

174
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:35,467
if you're up to answering them.

175
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,628
Commander Sisko hasn't decided

176
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,230
whether or not to grant you
asylum yet, Tahna.

177
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:42,207
Major, perhaps l should
conduct this alone.

178
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:44,472
Major?

179
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,640
l'm the liaison officer
to the Federation here...

180
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,842
Still fighting for Bajor

181
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,544
in my own way.

182
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,848
l'll stop by later.

183
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:07,925
What do you need to know,
Commander?

184
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:10,094
For starters,
why were they chasing you?

185
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:13,502
You really want to hear
the story of my life?

186
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:15,905
l assume, as a member
of the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>

187
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:17,807
you've committed serious acts
against them.

188
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:19,106
Any one of a hundred

189
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:22,613
that would lead
to a Cardassian death sentence.

190
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:25,083
Any of them since
their withdrawal from Bajor?

191
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:27,978
Frankly, yes.

192
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:29,113
Why would you

193
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:31,247
continue the violence
against them now?

194
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:37,693
To be honest,
l'm not sure anymore.

195
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,894
We say we're punishing them
for crimes committed against us

196
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,494
for over half a century

197
00:10:44,537 --> 00:10:47,734
but l've had enough
of the killing.

198
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:51,073
l'm sorry, Commander.

199
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,441
He needs rest now.

200
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:56,376
Admiral, l think Commander Sisko

201
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,384
is being incredibly
short-sighted.

202
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:01,512
He obviously doesn't understand
the issues involved.

203
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:03,920
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention, Major.

204
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:06,516
l'll stay in close touch
with the situation.

205
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,026
Thank you, Admiral.

206
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,668
Sir, the Cardassian warship
has docked.

207
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:21,003
Lieutenant Dax is making sure

208
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,668
that all procedural details
are precisely observed

209
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,678
no matter how long it takes.

210
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,111
Well done.

211
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:28,510
l have some more research

212
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:30,413
to do on the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>
before l see them.

213
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,716
Sir, l don't know much
about the Bajoran terrorists

214
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:37,348
but you've never fought
the Cardassians, have you?

215
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,721
No.

216
00:11:38,758 --> 00:11:42,353
Well, you wouldn't want
to turn a man-- any man--

217
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:44,693
over to their tender care, sir.

218
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:47,131
You just wouldn't.

219
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,530
Subspace transmission

220
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:51,036
from Admiral Rollman
for you, Commander.

221
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,731
ln my office.

222
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:00,769
Ben, that Bajoran woman

223
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:05,182
you have working for you
interrupted a staff meeting

224
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:06,981
to tell me how she disapproves

225
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,385
of your handling
of this asylum matter.

226
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:11,754
l think you have
a problem there, Commander.

227
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,986
Yes, Admiral.

228
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,326
lt's all right.

229
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:19,695
You're safe.

230
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:26,365
Strange to run
into each other here, isn't it?

231
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:28,101
lt's good to be with someone

232
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,505
who knows what it's been like
out there.

233
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:34,138
Wearing that uniform,
l thought maybe you'd forgotten.

234
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,112
Never.

235
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,113
No?

236
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,309
Working on the inside
hasn't dulled

237
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:41,013
that old fire just a little?

238
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,112
Uh... ask Sisko about that.

239
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,519
Don't get along?

240
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,718
Oil and water.

241
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:51,022
You're tired.
l should go.

242
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,088
Kira?

243
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:55,760
Do you think he'll give me
to the Cardassians?

244
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:58,396
Over my dead body.

245
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:01,100
Now, that's the Kira l remember.

246
00:13:15,788 --> 00:13:17,881
lf you require all vessels

247
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:20,859
to endure such lengthy
docking procedures, Commander

248
00:13:20,893 --> 00:13:21,860
you're going to have

249
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:23,418
a lot of impatient traffic
out there.

250
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:24,430
l apologize.

251
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:26,489
We're still trying
to repair all the damage

252
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:28,090
your forces did
before they left.

253
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:31,001
lt does create
unreasonable delays.

254
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:34,996
l accept your apology,
but not your explanation.

255
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,100
What about Tahna Los?

256
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:39,577
Well, we've got a problem.

257
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:43,343
A diplomatic insult
to the Cardassian people

258
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:45,009
would be a problem.

259
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:48,646
Delivering a wanted criminal
to us would not be.

260
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:52,681
Danar, in war, both sides
commit atrocities.

261
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:55,353
l can only tell you
that we are certain

262
00:13:55,394 --> 00:13:57,555
he plans to commit
more acts of terrorism.

263
00:13:57,597 --> 00:14:00,532
He tells me that he has
renounced the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>

264
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:02,693
and wants to help
to rebuild Bajor.

265
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:07,069
He has committed brutal acts
of destruction and murder

266
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:10,074
and he must pay
for those crimes.

267
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:13,476
l appreciate
the Cardassian position

268
00:14:13,513 --> 00:14:17,074
but l know if a Bajoran
freedom fighter

269
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:19,811
is turned over
to the Cardassians

270
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:21,319
by the Federation

271
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:24,323
that would be a mistake
that would undermine

272
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:27,326
everything that l'm trying
to accomplish here.

273
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,657
So, with apologies

274
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:31,720
l'm going to grant him asylum
for the time being.

275
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:34,995
Eventually, he'll want
to relocate to Bajor

276
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:37,662
and if you want
to pursue the matter

277
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:41,264
with the provisional government,
then that's your business.

278
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:58,783
How long since you've slept
in a comfortable bed?

279
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:03,318
l can adapt to that part
very quickly, thank you.

280
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,954
l'm glad you're here.

281
00:15:04,997 --> 00:15:07,397
We need you, Tahna.

282
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:11,028
l don't think the Federation
has any use

283
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,061
for my particular talents.

284
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,766
l mean, Bajor needs you.

285
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,691
lf you had the impression
that l'm a Federation officer

286
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:20,193
in any way, l promise you, l...

287
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:22,286
l thought you were
under Sisko's command.

288
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:23,387
l am, but...

289
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,161
Now, you see, that's something
l could never adapt to.

290
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:29,066
Someone has
to coordinate relations

291
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,037
between the Federation
and the provisional government.

292
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:33,972
At least,
with someone like me here...

293
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:35,339
Why?

294
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:37,435
Why should they be here at all?

295
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,743
What right does this so-called
provisional government have

296
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:44,512
to bring them here after
all we fought for, Kira?

297
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:45,745
Freedom from domination.

298
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:47,253
True independence.

299
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:48,755
No outsiders.

300
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,053
No Cardassians
and no Federation.

301
00:15:51,091 --> 00:15:54,652
Things have changed, Tahna.

302
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:56,993
With the discovery
of the wormhole...

303
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:59,659
Oh, yes, the wormhole.

304
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,861
Look, l don't want
the Federation here

305
00:16:01,902 --> 00:16:03,028
any more than you do

306
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:05,594
but they are serving a purpose,
for the time being at least.

307
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,038
Without the Federation

308
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:09,907
the Cardassians would
be back in a minute

309
00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:12,344
to take control of the wormhole

310
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:14,506
and the wormhole is
the future of Bajor, Tahna.

311
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:16,311
lt's bringing ships
and commerce.

312
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,784
lt's making us
a power in the quadrant.

313
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:21,049
l don't want to be a power
in the quadrant.

314
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:22,919
l want Bajor for Bajorans.

315
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:24,584
l want our homeland back.

316
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,024
We have it back.

317
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,288
And, as we grow stronger

318
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:29,387
we'll be able
to defend it ourselves

319
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,057
without having to lean
on the Federation

320
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:32,725
or anyone else.

321
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:36,065
l know it's difficult to see
after all we've been through.

322
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:37,764
We want it all now.

323
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:40,365
But with people like you
leading the way...

324
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:43,740
You have adapted, haven't you?

325
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:48,339
Tahna, l have put myself
on the line for you here.

326
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,078
You are finished
with the <i>Kohn-Ma?</i>

327
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:53,746
Yes.

328
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:56,119
Yes, l am finished
with the <i>Kohn-Ma.</i>

329
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:01,328
l've been talking
with several of the ministers

330
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:04,024
of the provisional government
about amnesty

331
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:07,465
for you and any member
of the <i>Kohn-Ma</i> who follows you.

332
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,935
Well, there are some
who might...

333
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,403
if there were assurances.

334
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,702
l'm working on it, Tahna.

335
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,733
l'll find a way
to make it happen.

336
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,223
What?

337
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,986
Sir, we've had a little problem.

338
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:36,486
These two women
are just arriving.

339
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,794
They objected to giving up
their weapons.

340
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:41,960
Klingons do not
surrender their weapons.

341
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:43,367
Who are you?

342
00:17:43,404 --> 00:17:46,669
We are Lursa and B'Etor
of the house of Duras.

343
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:48,368
And we have
specific regulations.

344
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:51,469
You can leave the weapons
or leave the station.

345
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:53,207
Your choice.

346
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:54,407
Please make it now.

347
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,779
Who are you?

348
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:59,513
l'm the one
giving you the choice.

349
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,989
Welcome to DS9.

350
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:21,332
We have some new guests
you might be interested in.

351
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,865
A couple of Klingon sisters

352
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,844
from the Duras family.

353
00:18:24,878 --> 00:18:27,039
Lursa and B'Etor.

354
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:28,513
You know them then?

355
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:31,985
They tried to grab control
of the Klingon High Council.

356
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,680
Started a brief civil war.

357
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,984
They've been out
of sight since then.

358
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:37,718
l ran a security check.

359
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:40,659
The Klingons have them
listed as renegades.

360
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:43,060
We've heard they've been
trying to raise capital

361
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:44,724
to rebuild their armies.

362
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:46,733
What are they doing here?

363
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,291
Sitting.

364
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,736
They went straight to Quark's,
but not for the gambling

365
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:54,263
and certainly not for the food.

366
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:55,741
They're just sitting.

367
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:57,607
l don't like it.

368
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,338
Why don't l... lock them up

369
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:04,976
and call the Klingons
to come get them?

370
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,280
Odo.

371
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,914
lf they're enemies
of the Klingon High Council...

372
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:11,447
They haven't broken
any laws here.

373
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:15,258
You can't just
throw them in jail.

374
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,695
You know, Cardassian rule
may have been oppressive

375
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:19,995
but at least it was simple.

376
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,228
Keep an eye on them.

377
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:25,671
As you wish, Commander.

378
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:57,661
And how are you this evening,
Mr. Garak?

379
00:19:57,704 --> 00:19:59,194
Excuse me.

380
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,730
Just plain, simple Garak,
you said.

381
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:03,572
Plain and simple.

382
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,271
Join me, Doctor.

383
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:06,904
Enhance my evening.

384
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:11,247
Keeping an eye on the ebb
and flow of things, are you?

385
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:14,254
As a clothier,
l do have a keen interest

386
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:17,314
on what the population
is wearing from day to day.

387
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:20,258
Klingons have
an odd sense of style.

388
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:22,091
Don't you agree?

389
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:23,926
Oh, yes, they do.

390
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:25,261
But intriguing.

391
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:26,493
l would say

392
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:31,527
that those two outfits
are worth studying closely.

393
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:40,469
Look.

394
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:13,842
All right, where's the payment?

395
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,347
lt's on its way.

396
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:17,077
That was not the arrangement.

397
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,311
l couldn't stop to get it.

398
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:21,412
l barely got past
the Cardassians.

399
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:23,047
Your safety is not our concern.

400
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,819
Your gold is.

401
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,723
lt will be available tomorrow.

402
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,387
Good.

403
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:31,591
Because if we have made
this trip for nothing

404
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:34,624
you will have made
a fatal mistake.

405
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:04,505
l managed to arrange a hearing
of the Ministers' Court.

406
00:22:04,543 --> 00:22:05,532
Any predictions?

407
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:07,102
Well, l have
two of the ministers--

408
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:09,011
the smart ones--
ready to vote for amnesty.

409
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:11,014
l'm sure one of the others
will fall in line.

410
00:22:11,116 --> 00:22:12,413
Good.

411
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:14,578
And Tahna says
two more of the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>

412
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,019
are willing to follow him

413
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:18,248
if you'll guarantee
their safety.

414
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,917
Done.

415
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:22,018
l have to say this, Commander.

416
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:25,585
When we first talked,
l wasn't sure you...

417
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:30,261
This wouldn't have been possible
without your support.

418
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:32,930
l want you to know
it's appreciated.

419
00:22:32,972 --> 00:22:34,030
Be sure to mention it

420
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:36,405
the next time you chat
with Admiral Rollman.

421
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:39,137
Sir?

422
00:22:39,178 --> 00:22:41,043
Go over my head again

423
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:43,671
and l'll have yours
on a platter.

424
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:56,489
So, Constable, news
about our Klingon sisters?

425
00:22:56,528 --> 00:22:58,894
They seem to make friends
easily.

426
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:00,228
Friends?

427
00:23:00,265 --> 00:23:02,665
Our reformed <i>Kohn-Ma,</i>
for example.

428
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:05,329
Tahna, with Lursa and B'Etor?

429
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:06,998
Talking about
a business arrangement.

430
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:08,505
He's paying them for something.

431
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,837
l don't know what.

432
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,843
The gold is
supposedly on its way.

433
00:23:11,877 --> 00:23:14,846
Two other members of the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>
may be bringing it.

434
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,871
How do you know that?

435
00:23:21,387 --> 00:23:24,618
Major Kira mentioned
that they were on their way.

436
00:23:24,657 --> 00:23:27,683
Do you want her
to know about this?

437
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:29,785
Not quite yet.

438
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:46,437
You are the clothier Garak?

439
00:23:46,478 --> 00:23:48,776
At your service, madam.

440
00:23:48,814 --> 00:23:52,944
May l show you some
of our latest fashions?

441
00:23:52,985 --> 00:23:57,217
Perhaps some silk lingerie
from Kraus lV?

442
00:23:57,256 --> 00:24:00,054
Watch your tongue,
Cardassian, or l'll

443
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:01,389
rip it out and eat it!

444
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:06,390
l meant no offense.

445
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:09,890
l have few Klingon patrons.

446
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:13,837
So, is there something
you wish to buy?

447
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:16,568
We're not here to buy.

448
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:19,202
We are here to sell.

449
00:24:19,244 --> 00:24:20,643
We understand

450
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,137
you still represent
Cardassian interests here.

451
00:24:24,183 --> 00:24:28,017
Ah, l am only a simple
clothing merchant.

452
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:30,749
We have no time for your games!

453
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:32,586
Do you want Tahna Los or not?!

454
00:24:32,624 --> 00:24:35,286
Are you in a position
to deliver the Bajoran

455
00:24:35,327 --> 00:24:36,760
to Cardassian authorities?

456
00:24:36,795 --> 00:24:38,160
What is he worth to them?

457
00:24:38,197 --> 00:24:40,961
ln gold-pressed latinum?

458
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:52,908
You insult us!

459
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:55,778
Ladies, ladies, please.

460
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:57,543
Everything is negotiable.

461
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,143
l am no more
than what l seem to be--

462
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:03,177
a merchant trying to make
the best transaction.

463
00:25:03,222 --> 00:25:07,921
So... let us haggle.

464
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:14,221
Yes?

465
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:20,928
l have
the third minister's vote.

466
00:25:20,973 --> 00:25:22,873
The hearing is simply
a formality now.

467
00:25:22,908 --> 00:25:25,536
You are going
to receive amnesty, Tahna.

468
00:25:25,577 --> 00:25:28,444
l never realized you were such
an accomplished politician.

469
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,415
Me? A politician?

470
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,418
No, l don't think so.

471
00:25:33,452 --> 00:25:36,012
You manipulate Sisko
and the Federation

472
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:38,180
the ministers
of the provisional government...

473
00:25:38,223 --> 00:25:39,747
l'm just determined.

474
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:43,455
l think they all simply
get tired of hearing my voice.

475
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:48,766
And here we expected to find

476
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:52,737
that Kira Nerys had lost
the fire in her heart.

477
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:54,705
What are you talking about?

478
00:25:58,076 --> 00:26:00,374
You knew l was here
before you even came.

479
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:05,349
Tahna, l trusted you.

480
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:07,215
l am <i>Kohn-Ma.</i>

481
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:09,220
l fight for the freedom
of Bajor.

482
00:26:09,254 --> 00:26:11,222
You once fought for it, as well.

483
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:12,621
l'm still fighting for it.

484
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,250
Stop deluding yourself!

485
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:17,456
You say you don't believe
in the Federation.

486
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:19,430
You say you don't believe
in the provisional government

487
00:26:19,464 --> 00:26:20,829
and yet you are
their dance instructor.

488
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:22,333
That's not fair.

489
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:23,994
Don't be naive, Major!

490
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:26,527
l don't want the Federation
here, but, for now...

491
00:26:26,572 --> 00:26:29,405
Once you're in your comfortable
bed with the Federation

492
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:30,533
you won't be able to get out.

493
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:31,668
We won't be able to get out.

494
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,234
lf you expect me to commit

495
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:35,769
some act of violence
against the Federation...

496
00:26:35,814 --> 00:26:38,009
No... no, the violence is over.

497
00:26:38,116 --> 00:26:39,413
That is the truth.

498
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:41,749
No one will get hurt in any way.

499
00:26:41,787 --> 00:26:43,015
l promise you that.

500
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:44,918
But l do need your help.

501
00:26:44,957 --> 00:26:46,925
You already lied to me, Tahna.

502
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,586
l know how the game works.

503
00:26:48,627 --> 00:26:49,651
To do what we plan

504
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:52,163
we need a small ship
capable of warp speed.

505
00:26:52,197 --> 00:26:56,190
l gambled that l could convince
you to get it for us.

506
00:26:56,235 --> 00:26:58,601
And just what is
this peaceful plan?

507
00:26:58,637 --> 00:27:00,867
ln one move, and nonviolently

508
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:04,865
we accomplish everything
both of us has ever wanted

509
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,877
for Bajor.

510
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:06,900
How?

511
00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:10,977
l know the game, too, Kira.

512
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:14,075
You know l cannot risk
telling you that.

513
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:18,078
How do you know l won't
just go straight to Sisko?

514
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:21,983
Well, if you do,
then we'll both know

515
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,152
where your loyalties are

516
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:25,254
won't we?

517
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:34,943
Ah, plain, simple Garak.

518
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,447
How are you today?

519
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:39,474
Being observant, Doctor.

520
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:40,917
l'm sure of it.

521
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:43,649
There's a time for levity,
my young friend

522
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:46,817
and a time for genuine concern.

523
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:49,851
The arrival on this station,
for instance

524
00:27:49,895 --> 00:27:52,125
of those two <i>Kohn-Ma</i> terrorists.

525
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:54,655
Terrorists?

526
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,668
What are they doing here?

527
00:27:56,702 --> 00:28:00,331
l'm not exactly sure,
but, together

528
00:28:00,372 --> 00:28:04,035
we might have some success
at finding out.

529
00:28:04,076 --> 00:28:05,839
Garak, l'm a doctor, not...

530
00:28:05,878 --> 00:28:08,676
And, once you do have
the appropriate answer

531
00:28:08,714 --> 00:28:12,514
l'm sure you'll know
what to do with it.

532
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:14,348
l really must
be getting along now.

533
00:28:14,386 --> 00:28:16,013
Uh... Doctor...

534
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:20,355
l think it's time for you
to take advantage of my shop.

535
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:24,021
lf you'll be there
at exactly 2055 hours tonight

536
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:26,361
l promise to show you a suit

537
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:29,026
that will make you
into a new man.

538
00:28:29,068 --> 00:28:30,194
A suit?

539
00:28:30,235 --> 00:28:31,702
We're talking about terrorists

540
00:28:31,737 --> 00:28:34,706
and you want me
to buy a new suit.

541
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,708
Doctor, am l making
myself clear?

542
00:28:36,742 --> 00:28:41,202
l want you to buy
a new suit tonight at 2055...

543
00:28:41,246 --> 00:28:42,713
exactly.

544
00:28:42,748 --> 00:28:44,045
Uh, yes.

545
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,380
l see.

546
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:47,715
Well, if you'll excuse me.

547
00:28:47,753 --> 00:28:49,550
Mmm.

548
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:55,823
A suit.

549
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:57,192
Mmm.

550
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,504
Major.

551
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,062
Commander.

552
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:15,637
l'd like to meet the two <i>Kohn-Ma</i>
who just arrived

553
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:16,909
as soon as possible.

554
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:18,347
Of course.

555
00:29:18,384 --> 00:29:19,681
l'll arrange it.

556
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,016
How do they seem to you?

557
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:23,180
Sir?

558
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:25,520
Do you feel as secure about them

559
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:28,025
as you do about Tahna Los?

560
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,584
Absolutely.

561
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:31,061
Commander Sisko.

562
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:37,369
l need some guidance.

563
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:38,700
Yes, Doctor.

564
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:41,069
lt's about Garak--
the Cardassian.

565
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:45,202
l'm afraid this relationship
has gotten a little out of hand.

566
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:46,211
How's that?

567
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,372
He wants me to buy a suit.

568
00:29:48,414 --> 00:29:49,381
A suit?

569
00:29:49,415 --> 00:29:50,882
At exactly 2055 tonight.

570
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:51,883
Why 2055?

571
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,316
l don't know,
but it has something to do

572
00:29:53,352 --> 00:29:55,718
with those two Bajoran
terrorists on board.

573
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:58,723
He says that, together,
he and l might discover

574
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:00,054
what they're really doing here.

575
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,151
l don't understand
why he wants me involved.

576
00:30:02,194 --> 00:30:04,389
Sometimes communications
can't be conducted

577
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,727
through official channels.

578
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:08,392
Maybe this is their way
of telling us

579
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:09,901
that we have a common enemy.

580
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:11,300
Well, what do you want me to do?

581
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:14,965
l think, Doctor, you could
definitely use a new suit.

582
00:30:22,448 --> 00:30:24,416
Busy?

583
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,749
What can l do for you?

584
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:31,415
Are, um... are all
the security measures in place

585
00:30:31,457 --> 00:30:34,119
for the trip
to the Ministers' Court?

586
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,094
l told you they'd be
taken care of and they will.

587
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:45,726
Fine.

588
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:53,000
You know, there's one thing
about you humanoids

589
00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:55,706
l can't imitate very well.

590
00:30:55,747 --> 00:30:57,237
What's that?

591
00:30:57,282 --> 00:30:59,546
Pretense.

592
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:02,577
There's a special talent to it.

593
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:04,885
lt's as hard for me

594
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:07,391
as creating one of your noses.

595
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:11,624
Maybe that's why l've learned
to respect your opinion

596
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:14,860
Constable-- never any pretense.

597
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:27,971
How much do you know about me,
Odo?

598
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:32,944
More than you probably realize.

599
00:31:34,786 --> 00:31:38,779
l've done some things
l'm not proud of.

600
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:45,761
l still have nightmares about
the raids on the Haru Outpost

601
00:31:45,797 --> 00:31:50,496
but at least l was sure
about what l was doing then.

602
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:56,897
And...

603
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:02,180
there's something
you're not sure of now.

604
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:05,183
You have no more love
for the Federation than l do.

605
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:06,343
Meaning?

606
00:32:08,086 --> 00:32:10,680
Maybe there are still wars
to be fought

607
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,122
and l'm just
making a fool of myself

608
00:32:13,158 --> 00:32:14,989
doing what l'm doing here.

609
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:22,389
lt sounds like you're trying to
talk yourself into something...

610
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:24,402
or out of something.

611
00:32:24,436 --> 00:32:27,963
Either way,
l have to betray someone.

612
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,636
The only important thing
is not to betray yourself.

613
00:32:35,113 --> 00:32:39,846
How could l possibly turn
against my own people?

614
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:41,716
Are they

615
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:43,084
your own people?

616
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:45,919
They're no different
than l used to be.

617
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:49,594
Used to be?

618
00:32:49,628 --> 00:32:52,688
l could just refuse
to help them--

619
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:54,756
ignore the whole thing.

620
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:04,373
The Joranian ostrich hides by
sticking its head underwater--

621
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:07,810
sometimes even until it drowns.

622
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:11,081
And they'd find a way

623
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:13,641
to do whatever
they want to do anyway

624
00:33:13,685 --> 00:33:17,246
and l'd still feel responsible
for the consequences.

625
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:29,093
lt was so much easier
when l knew who the enemy was.

626
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:32,062
Odo to Sisko.

627
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:34,072
Go ahead.

628
00:33:34,106 --> 00:33:35,937
There's someone down in here
in security

629
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,669
who wants to talk to you,
Commander.

630
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:44,749
Come in quickly, Doctor.

631
00:33:44,783 --> 00:33:46,080
You're late.

632
00:33:46,118 --> 00:33:47,415
lt's 2057.

633
00:33:47,452 --> 00:33:48,749
Now just take this

634
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:52,154
and try it on
as many times as you like.

635
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,521
And stay very, very quiet.

636
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:54,718
l was just...

637
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:08,369
Ah, right on time.

638
00:34:08,407 --> 00:34:09,874
Welcome.

639
00:34:09,908 --> 00:34:12,376
Save your welcome, Cardassian.

640
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:15,380
Do your people
want the Bajoran or not?

641
00:34:15,414 --> 00:34:19,043
l can now venture to say,
with some certainty

642
00:34:19,084 --> 00:34:22,053
that you will receive
the agreed-upon payment

643
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:23,384
on delivery.

644
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:26,391
We will complete
our business with Tahna Los

645
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:27,722
in four hours.

646
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:29,886
And what business might that be?

647
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:31,919
That is not your concern.

648
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:34,898
lf it requires
that those l represent

649
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:38,232
must take extra precautions,
it becomes my concern.

650
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,230
We will deliver him
a cylinder of bilitrium.

651
00:34:43,275 --> 00:34:45,243
The rendezvous will be

652
00:34:45,277 --> 00:34:48,906
on the dark side
of Bajor Vlll's lower moon.

653
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:52,542
The Cardassians
can have him then.

654
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,360
What's bilitrium?

655
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,195
Ah, a rare, crystalline element

656
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:11,691
that can be an incredibly
powerful source of energy

657
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,706
provided, of course, one has
an antimatter converter.

658
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,038
Unfortunately,
that's why Cardassians

659
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:19,737
were chasing Tahna Los
when he arrived here.

660
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:22,042
He stole one.

661
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,378
But if he's got both...

662
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,883
Quite right, Doctor.

663
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:28,147
He has the ingredients
for a bomb--

664
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:33,749
a bomb of significant
destructive capability.

665
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:46,085
We have nothing to hold them on.

666
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,087
They haven't
committed any crime yet.

667
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:49,645
Conspiracy is a crime.

668
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,917
Conspiracy to what?

669
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,820
We don't even know
what their plan is.

670
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,827
Once the switch
with the Klingons is made

671
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,328
you've got them holding
the components

672
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,386
to an explosive device.

673
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,920
That's evidence
enough right there.

674
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,464
Chief O'Brien is right.

675
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,468
We have to give them
the runabout.

676
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:03,469
Agreed.

677
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:05,869
And l have to be on it.

678
00:36:05,905 --> 00:36:07,770
Not agreed, Major.

679
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:10,401
Commander, Tahna doesn't know
if he can trust me as it is.

680
00:36:10,443 --> 00:36:12,638
lf l try to stay behind,
he won't buy into this.

681
00:36:12,678 --> 00:36:14,873
The only way to convince him
is if l'm on board.

682
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:16,245
lf Tahna fails

683
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:18,546
l promise you, others will try.

684
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:21,052
At least this way,
you can find out

685
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:22,486
what they're up to.

686
00:36:22,522 --> 00:36:24,888
Mr. O'Brien,
you and l will take a runabout

687
00:36:24,924 --> 00:36:26,687
to a point behind
the second moon of Bajor Vlll

688
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,886
to avoid detection.

689
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:28,894
Aye, sir.

690
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:31,896
Dax, stay in touch with us
on a secured channel.

691
00:36:31,964 --> 00:36:34,330
Keep an eye on the Cardassians.

692
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:36,494
They'll be coming
to the party, too.

693
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,702
You get him there, Major.

694
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,004
We'll be waiting.

695
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:54,817
They're moving
into the runabout.

696
00:36:54,854 --> 00:36:55,843
Acknowledged.

697
00:36:55,888 --> 00:36:57,014
DS9 to <i>Ganges.</i>

698
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:58,250
Go ahead.

699
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,656
They're in the <i>Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

700
00:36:59,692 --> 00:37:01,660
They're initializing
prelaunch systems now.

701
00:37:01,694 --> 00:37:03,252
Understood, Lieutenant.

702
00:37:03,296 --> 00:37:05,628
Shut down
all main power systems.

703
00:37:11,804 --> 00:37:14,864
Dead quiet.

704
00:37:20,913 --> 00:37:24,371
Bajor Vlll
in 120,000 kilometers.

705
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:26,578
Dropping to impulse.

706
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:32,691
What is that?

707
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,521
An antimatter converter.

708
00:37:36,562 --> 00:37:38,587
l'm transferring power
from the ship's warp drive

709
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,620
into the storage cells.

710
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:43,633
We've got a Klingon bird-of-prey
de-cloaking dead ahead.

711
00:37:43,669 --> 00:37:45,000
lt's all right.

712
00:37:45,037 --> 00:37:47,767
We're here to meet them.

713
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,640
Klingons? Why?

714
00:37:50,676 --> 00:37:52,735
You'll know soon enough.

715
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:03,254
The Klingons have powered up
their transporters.

716
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:05,280
Prepare to go to full impulse.

717
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:15,832
13 kilograms

718
00:38:15,868 --> 00:38:17,995
of gold-pressed latinum,
as promised.

719
00:38:18,037 --> 00:38:19,527
This is yours.

720
00:38:22,308 --> 00:38:24,299
<i>'eH. HlmaH!</i>

721
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,877
What is it?

722
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:31,643
Bajoran independence.

723
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:37,449
Bird-of-prey is moving off
and cloaking.

724
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:40,991
Set up an intercept course
for the runabout.

725
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,723
lntercept in one minute,
12 seconds.

726
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,291
DS9 to <i>Ganges.</i>

727
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:50,734
<i>Ganges.</i>

728
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,635
The Cardassian Warship <i>Aldara</i>

729
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,469
is crossing the border,
Benjamin

730
00:38:54,507 --> 00:38:57,135
on an intercept course
with the <i>Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

731
00:38:57,176 --> 00:39:00,373
They'll enter Bajoran space
in 29 seconds.

732
00:39:00,413 --> 00:39:02,142
Acknowledged.

733
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:04,979
The <i>Yangtzee's</i> sensors should
be picking us up now, sir.

734
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:10,287
What is that?

735
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:11,984
lt's another runabout.

736
00:39:12,024 --> 00:39:14,788
They must have been
waiting for us here.

737
00:39:14,827 --> 00:39:16,294
How did they know?

738
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:18,729
We also have a Cardassian
warship three minutes away.

739
00:39:18,764 --> 00:39:21,232
The Klingons must have
sold us out.

740
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,292
Prepare to engage warp engines.

741
00:39:23,336 --> 00:39:24,860
There's nowhere to run, Tahna.

742
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,131
We don't have to go far.

743
00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:34,746
l should have known.

744
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,044
Now set the course for DS9.

745
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,641
No.

746
00:39:38,684 --> 00:39:41,653
lf you don't, l'll explode
the bomb right here and destroy

747
00:39:41,687 --> 00:39:43,416
all six colonies on Bajor Vlll.

748
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:46,516
You would kill thousands
of your own people for this?

749
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:48,550
The question is
whether you would kill them

750
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,061
by refusing to set the course.

751
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,007
They've gone to warp.

752
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,339
Follow them.

753
00:40:04,377 --> 00:40:06,709
<i>Ganges</i> to <i>Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

754
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:10,876
Drop out of warp,
or we'll open fire.

755
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:13,316
Repeat:
Reduce your power immediately

756
00:40:13,352 --> 00:40:14,785
or we will open fire.

757
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,551
l doubt he'll shoot
while his Major is on board

758
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:20,081
but just in case...

759
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,923
This is the voice
of the <i>Kohn-Ma.</i>

760
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:24,394
There is an armed
bilitrium explosive device

761
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,419
on board this ship.

762
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:29,025
Fire on us,
and you will detonate it.

763
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:32,333
lf that device goes off
while they're at warp

764
00:40:32,371 --> 00:40:34,396
they'll spread radiation
across half the system.

765
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,930
He's headed straight back
to the station.

766
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,271
This is the Federation
Vessel <i>Ganges</i>

767
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,542
to the Cardassian
Warship <i>Aldara.</i>

768
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:46,915
So... we're finally allies,
Commander.

769
00:40:46,952 --> 00:40:48,146
Gul Danar

770
00:40:48,187 --> 00:40:49,950
the Federation Runabout
<i>Yangtzee Kiang</i>

771
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,923
is carrying an explosive
bilitrium device.

772
00:40:51,957 --> 00:40:53,424
Can you intercept

773
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:55,427
before it reaches
the space station?

774
00:40:55,461 --> 00:40:57,952
Our time to intercept
is two minutes, 14 seconds.

775
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,691
That's about a minute
too late, Commander.

776
00:40:59,732 --> 00:41:02,200
lf l may take
this opportunity to say

777
00:41:02,234 --> 00:41:03,861
that l warned you...

778
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:06,371
Can we get them
in a tractor beam?

779
00:41:06,405 --> 00:41:07,838
Not at these speeds.

780
00:41:07,873 --> 00:41:09,841
They have 27 seconds on us.

781
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:12,400
We may have to shoot
them down, Commander.

782
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:14,413
Ready photons, Chief.

783
00:41:14,447 --> 00:41:16,813
We'll fire as soon
as they slow to impulse.

784
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,009
Aye, sir.

785
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,551
100,000 kilometers to DS9.

786
00:41:28,594 --> 00:41:31,392
This is your idea
of a nonviolent solution?

787
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,398
You realize there are hundreds

788
00:41:33,432 --> 00:41:35,696
of Bajoran civilians
aboard the station?

789
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:38,202
No one's going to be hurt, Kira.

790
00:41:38,237 --> 00:41:41,138
Adjust your course
to take a vectored approach

791
00:41:41,173 --> 00:41:43,698
past the mouth of the wormhole.

792
00:41:43,742 --> 00:41:44,902
The wormhole...

793
00:41:44,944 --> 00:41:48,380
lt's not the space station
you're after.

794
00:41:48,414 --> 00:41:50,382
You can't possibly believe
you can destroy

795
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:52,350
the wormhole with that device?

796
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,046
l don't have to destroy it--
just collapse the entrance.

797
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:58,386
You're only hurting Bajor
by doing this, Tahna.

798
00:41:58,424 --> 00:42:00,415
No more wormhole

799
00:42:00,459 --> 00:42:03,690
no more Federation
or Cardassians...

800
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,027
or anyone.

801
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,376
Drop out of warp.

802
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:10,407
Now!

803
00:42:15,382 --> 00:42:17,043
My God, they're going
into the wormhole

804
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,311
at full impulse.

805
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:07,022
Damn you.

806
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,625
Sisko to Kira.

807
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:10,863
Are you all right, Major?

808
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:13,872
No, she's not all right,
Commander!

809
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,773
And if you want her alive,
you'll do exactly as l say!

810
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,368
Listen to me carefully, Tahna.

811
00:43:18,411 --> 00:43:20,709
You can either surrender now,
to me

812
00:43:20,747 --> 00:43:23,511
or you can wait
for the Cardassian warship

813
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,644
and l can let them
deal with you this time.

814
00:43:26,686 --> 00:43:27,710
Your choice.

815
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:46,470
There'll be no further
resistance, Commander.

816
00:44:02,322 --> 00:44:03,983
Tahna...

817
00:44:04,024 --> 00:44:06,322
the old ways don't work anymore.

818
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,520
Everything is different now.

819
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:10,859
l had to do this.

820
00:44:10,897 --> 00:44:12,888
One day, you'll understand.

821
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,225
Traitor.
