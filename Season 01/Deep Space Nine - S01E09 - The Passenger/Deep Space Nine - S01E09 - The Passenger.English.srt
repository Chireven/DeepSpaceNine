1
00:00:07,198 --> 00:00:09,325
l've never seen
anything like that.

2
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:10,493
Hmm?

3
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:12,331
l've never seen
anything like that.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,428
The woman?

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:14,597
She was dead.

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:16,105
The tricorder clearly showed...

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,437
Ah, yes, well, tricorders--

8
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,942
very accurate with live people

9
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:20,466
not so accurate with dead ones.

10
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:22,570
We learned that first
year medical school.

11
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:26,811
Well, l was
very impressed, Doctor.

12
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:28,819
Hmm, and well you
should have been.

13
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:31,447
l impressed myself
on that one, actually.

14
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,286
l can't imagine
what other doctor

15
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,986
would even consider examining
the scapular nodes

16
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:37,323
for parasitic infection.

17
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,829
l just seem to have a talent,
l suppose.

18
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:43,129
A vision that sees past
the obvious, around the mundane

19
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:45,362
right to the target.

20
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:47,803
Fate has granted me a gift,
Major.

21
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:49,829
A gift to be a healer.

22
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:54,711
l feel privileged to be
in your presence.

23
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:56,076
Oh, glad to have you along.

24
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:58,206
Did anyone ever tell you
that you're...?

25
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:01,944
Priority one
broadband distress signal.

26
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:05,888
Kobliad Transport Ship <i>Reyab</i>
to any ship.

27
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:07,948
Our central power linkage
has exploded.

28
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:09,789
We're losing life-support.

29
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:11,124
Please respond.

30
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:14,131
Just picking it up
on long-range sensors.

31
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,463
Bearing 347 mark 08.

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,798
l'm reading
massive energy leakage.

33
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:22,636
lts aft structural integrity
field is failing.

34
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:25,642
This is the Federation
Ship <i>Rio Grande.</i>

35
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:27,200
We're on our way.

36
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:39,181
O2 pressure is dropping rapidly.

37
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:41,020
Toxic gas levels are rising.

38
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,049
We've got no more
than ten minutes'

39
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:44,685
breathing time left in here.

40
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:47,697
Automatic fire suppression
must be off-line.

41
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,722
l'll check
the central power linkage.

42
00:01:57,908 --> 00:02:00,001
Relax.

43
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:02,678
l'm a doctor.

44
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:04,078
What happened?

45
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:05,581
You lost consciousness.

46
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:08,449
Now listen, is there anyone else
aboard your ship?

47
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:10,044
We've got to evacuate it.

48
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:12,248
The pilot is dead.

49
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:15,956
l'm reading another life-form.

50
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:20,720
No, don't open that.

51
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:22,391
lt's sealed.

52
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,833
The prisoner
l was transporting...

53
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:26,996
he started the fire to escape.

54
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:28,334
He's dying.

55
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:30,340
Where is the manual override?

56
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:32,171
No!

57
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:33,437
Stop.

58
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:34,705
Don't!

59
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,905
Wait.

60
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:41,543
Don't go in there.

61
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:43,746
He's dangerous.

62
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:48,521
l assure you, in this condition,
he's of no threat to anyone.

63
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:51,187
Power linkages
are completely shot.

64
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:54,629
Maneuvering subsystems
are out.

65
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:57,566
l've managed to stabilize
the structural integrity field

66
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,899
but l don't know
how long it's going to last.

67
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:01,370
We'll have to tow it in.

68
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:02,599
His synaptic field
is dissipating.

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,732
l can't get a neural reading.

70
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:06,242
l have to get him
to the emergency unit

71
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:07,244
on the runabout.

72
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:09,041
Computer, four to transport.

73
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:17,587
Make...

74
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,580
me...

75
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,355
live.

76
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:40,474
This one, l can't bring back.

77
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:56,685
Where am l?

78
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,812
You're on Station DS9.

79
00:05:57,854 --> 00:06:01,483
l'm Dr. Julian Bashir.

80
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:04,016
Ty Kajada.

81
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,392
Kobliad Security.

82
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:11,367
DS9...

83
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:13,335
but that's where he was going.

84
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,496
Where is he?

85
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:16,165
Where is Vantika?

86
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:17,503
Your prisoner?

87
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,838
He's dead.

88
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,001
You're certain?

89
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:21,874
Yes.
You were the only survivor.

90
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:23,209
Where is his body?

91
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:24,713
l have it in stasis.

92
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:26,079
l want to see it.

93
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:27,413
When you're feeling stronger.

94
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,781
Now.

95
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:30,718
Preliminary examinations
indicated

96
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:34,053
the subject died
of a massive respiratory failure

97
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,354
brought on
by the pulmonary trauma

98
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:38,020
suffered during the fire.

99
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,689
Are you sure
it's the same body?

100
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,027
Quite certain.

101
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:44,992
lt's been sealed in here
ever since our arrival.

102
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:51,157
Have you run
a retinal imaging scan?

103
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:52,665
What for?

104
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,065
To confirm that there is
no residual activity

105
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:56,466
in the visual cortex.

106
00:06:56,503 --> 00:07:00,064
Miss Kajada, l assure
you, he is dead.

107
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:03,565
He's faked his death
more times than l can tell you.

108
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,738
And the last time
someone thought he was dead

109
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,578
they didn't live
to regret the mistake.

110
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:11,015
He was a murderer?

111
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:14,918
That description
doesn't begin to do justice

112
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:18,948
to the horrors he's
responsible for on my world.

113
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:25,863
He's quite brilliant,
in his own way.

114
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,357
A man of science,
who killed others

115
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:31,701
to prolong his own life.

116
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:35,367
l've tracked him for 20 years.

117
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:40,912
Please perform an autopsy.

118
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:45,044
l want his identity confirmed
with a DNA reference scan.

119
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:47,450
Uh... of course.

120
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:51,854
And have someone scan my ship.

121
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:53,860
l want to make sure

122
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:57,227
there are no anomalous
life-forms on board.

123
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,634
Are you sure that's necessary?

124
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:04,159
Very sure.

125
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:10,609
lced <i>raktajino,</i> extra cream.

126
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:11,941
Thank you, Quark.

127
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,607
At your service, day or night.

128
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:15,979
Thanks.

129
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:19,478
Poor woman.

130
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,511
She's obviously
infatuated with me.

131
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:25,318
You're deluding yourself.

132
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:28,328
There's nothing wrong
with a good delusion.

133
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:31,627
l sell them upstairs to
dozens of people every day.

134
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:34,293
Besides, there
is something in her eyes

135
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:35,562
when she looks at me.

136
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:36,626
Mmm.

137
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,298
An allergic reaction, no doubt.

138
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,739
l think she's lonely.

139
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:45,404
Dax? She has ten lifetimes'
worth of friends to call on

140
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:47,037
before she calls you.

141
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:49,309
And every man on the station

142
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:51,977
would like to be buying her
a <i>raktajino.</i>

143
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,420
Ah, but l'm the one
with the <i>raktajino</i> machine.

144
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:59,653
She seems to prefer
spending most of her time alone

145
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:01,354
which l understand perfectly.

146
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:04,626
Then that must make her
the perfect woman for you.

147
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:08,999
l wouldn't intrude
on her privacy as some would.

148
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:10,366
You're pathetic.

149
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:12,599
You think everyone in the galaxy

150
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,006
should be as lonely
and as miserable as you are.

151
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:17,599
As hard as it may be

152
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:22,138
for you to understand,
some of us like company.

153
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:25,481
The sound
of a friendly voice.

154
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,682
The sight
of a familiar face.

155
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:34,024
The feel of smooth,
pliant flesh.

156
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:36,255
Why do you bother?

157
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:38,457
lt's good to want things.

158
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:41,023
Even things you can't have?

159
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:43,432
Especially things l can't have.

160
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,836
Like the deuridium shipment?

161
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:47,464
Deuridium shipment?

162
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:50,670
ls there a deuridium shipment
coming here?

163
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:54,477
l'm watching you, Quark.

164
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:58,541
And l'm watching you, Jadzia.

165
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:12,461
lnteresting technique.

166
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:15,332
Do you always get ready
for an important operation

167
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:18,463
by leaking word about it
to the local black market?

168
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:23,841
How l handle my business
is none of your concern.

169
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:25,504
l'm afraid that it is.

170
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:28,673
Lieutenant George Primmin,
Starfleet Security.

171
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,842
And if you don't mind,
l would like to talk to you

172
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:33,876
about the deuridium shipment
from the Gamma Quadrant.

173
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,217
There's nothing to discuss.

174
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:36,722
Security is already in place.

175
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:40,716
l would appreciate it
if we could go over it anyhow.

176
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:42,422
lt took me three weeks
to get here

177
00:10:42,462 --> 00:10:44,521
and l'd hate to think
it was for nothing.

178
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:48,226
lf you insist.

179
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:51,601
Meet me in my office
at 1700 hours.

180
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:56,235
The autopsy revealed
nothing out of the ordinary.

181
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:57,903
Fingerprints,
cerebral cortex scans

182
00:10:57,944 --> 00:10:59,673
retinal patterns
all matched up perfectly

183
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:01,340
with the records
Kajada provided.

184
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:03,508
Vantika may have faked
his death before

185
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,711
but l don't think
he's faking this time.

186
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,049
Why was he coming here?

187
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:08,281
Well, they're Kobliad.

188
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:09,788
The deuridium.

189
00:11:09,823 --> 00:11:11,188
l'm sorry...?

190
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:13,192
The Kobliad are a dying race.

191
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:16,161
They need deuridium to stabilize
their cell structure.

192
00:11:16,196 --> 00:11:17,686
lt prolongs their life-span.

193
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:20,859
The Federation's been working
to supply them with deuridium

194
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:23,062
but even the new deposits
from the Gamma Quadrant

195
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:25,434
aren't enough to service
the whole population.

196
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:27,303
lt's so scarce

197
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,070
that some of the Kobliad
have gone underground to get it.

198
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,408
So, he was coming here
to hijack a shipment?

199
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:33,743
Exactly.

200
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,805
ls Kajada satisfied
with your autopsy?

201
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:39,410
l don't think anything
is going to convince her

202
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:41,080
he's dead, Commander.

203
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:43,351
Vantika has been the focus
of Kajada's attention

204
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,687
for most of her adult life.

205
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:47,352
ln a way, they were
as intimately connected

206
00:11:47,394 --> 00:11:49,021
as any two beings could be.

207
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:53,021
Let's do her the courtesy
of granting her requests

208
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:55,000
as long as they're not
too far out of line.

209
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:57,503
A quick sweep of her ship
is not too much to ask.

210
00:11:57,537 --> 00:11:58,834
l'm more concerned

211
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:01,272
that Vantika might have
had help here

212
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:03,276
waiting to hijack the shipment.

213
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,278
Ah, Mr. Primmin.
Good. ln my office.

214
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:06,540
l want to brief you

215
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,605
on a security issue
that's arisen.

216
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:10,047
l'll get Odo up here.

217
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,447
Uh, that's okay, Major.

218
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:13,783
l'll fill him in later
on anything he needs to know.

219
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,460
How are you getting on with
the Constable, Lieutenant?

220
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,525
l'm sure he's very good
at keeping order

221
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:29,830
down there on the Promenade.

222
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,201
But...?

223
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:34,639
Frankly, isn't the security
of a deuridium shipment

224
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:36,232
a little over his head?

225
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:39,177
l mean, he was chatting about it
in the bar

226
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:40,907
with that Ferengi, Quark.

227
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:43,415
lf l could overhear it,
so could half a dozen others.

228
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,883
lt's hard to keep a secret

229
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:46,749
in a place like this,
Lieutenant.

230
00:12:46,786 --> 00:12:48,083
lt's not a starship.

231
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:49,418
l understand that.

232
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:52,721
l'm sure almost everyone knows
about the shipment by now.

233
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,192
Odo was probably making sure

234
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:55,956
that Quark knows
we know he knows.

235
00:12:55,996 --> 00:12:59,659
lt's not the way they taught us
at the Academy, is it, sir?

236
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:01,098
lf you want my opinion...

237
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:02,431
Actually, l don't.

238
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:05,734
You and l are guests
of the Bajorans, Lieutenant.

239
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:09,572
You don't have to forget what
you learned at the Academy

240
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:12,578
you just don't throw it
in anyone's face here.

241
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:14,443
lf you're really smart,
you might even learn

242
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:16,574
a few new things about station
security from our Constable.

243
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:17,605
Clear?

244
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:20,312
Very clear, sir.

245
00:13:20,353 --> 00:13:22,651
Now, regarding the shipment.

246
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:26,216
We've been made aware
of a possible Kobliad plot

247
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:28,056
to hijack the deuridium.

248
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:32,224
You and Odo ought to have
a talk with Kajada

249
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:35,098
the Kobliad Security Officer
who arrived yesterday.

250
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:59,468
Um, before we get started,
l want to apologize

251
00:13:59,502 --> 00:14:02,266
for us getting off
on the wrong foot.

252
00:14:02,305 --> 00:14:03,932
Think nothing of it.

253
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:06,601
Listen, l know
this is your bailiwick.

254
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:09,942
l don't mean to be
throwing my weight around.

255
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,446
No hard feelings.

256
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:12,948
None at all.

257
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:15,610
Just because l'm
from Starfleet Security

258
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:18,450
doesn't mean l don't
respect your opinion.

259
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:20,786
How about showing me
what you got

260
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:23,348
and l'll see if there's
anything we can work with?

261
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:28,122
Lieutenant, you're welcome
to see my plans

262
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:31,292
but l assure you,
l've taken every precaution

263
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:32,961
regarding the shipment.

264
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,300
However, if you have
any suggestions

265
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:37,238
l'd be happy to hear them.

266
00:14:38,307 --> 00:14:40,798
What?!

267
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:43,879
Odo to Ops.

268
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,210
Go ahead.

269
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:49,082
Major, are we having
some sort of computer problem?

270
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,554
Everything in active memory
has been accessed and purged.

271
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:58,593
That's impossible.

272
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:00,323
Oh, it's possible.

273
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:03,560
Vantika did the exact
same thing on Rigel Vll.

274
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:16,935
l know Vantika.

275
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:19,470
l've learned to think
as he thinks.

276
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:21,779
Kajada, our best
evidence suggests

277
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:24,378
Vantika stopped
thinking two days ago.

278
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,580
He's alive

279
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:27,145
and he's on board this station.

280
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,090
And his first thought
when he came on board

281
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,218
was to plan a way
to access your security files

282
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,922
on the deuridium shipment,
which is exactly what he's done.

283
00:15:33,963 --> 00:15:37,990
Even if he was alive,
it doesn't make sense

284
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:41,128
that he would purge
an entire computer memory

285
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,001
to go after a single file.

286
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,666
lt makes perfect sense.

287
00:15:44,707 --> 00:15:46,800
Try to access the single file

288
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:48,333
and you'd be stopped

289
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:50,572
by a dozen
different lock-outs

290
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:52,638
that l put in to protect it.

291
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:54,309
But you would never
consider locking out

292
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,011
the active memory
of your entire system.

293
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:58,815
lt would make it impossible
to use the computers at all.

294
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:00,584
So that's where
you're vulnerable.

295
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:02,750
But how would he gain access?

296
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:06,091
ln the past, he's used
a subspace shunt.

297
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,960
lt would be attached
to a secondary system

298
00:16:07,997 --> 00:16:10,329
something that runs
throughout the entire facility

299
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:11,799
but isn't covered by security.

300
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,802
The lighting controls.

301
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:15,360
Or the replicators.

302
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:19,534
l'm showing an unauthorized tap
into the computer system.

303
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:23,909
A temperature control panel,
level 21, section 10.

304
00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:25,345
-Security to level...
-Security...

305
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:28,809
To L-21, S-10.

306
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:32,184
We're looking
for a subspace crossover link

307
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:33,882
to the computer system.

308
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:34,981
Acknowledged.

309
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:37,424
Tell them to be careful.

310
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,893
Vantika undoubtedly
equipped the shunt

311
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:40,896
with an auto-destruct system.

312
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,559
You know that for certain,
without having to check?

313
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,431
l know Vantika.

314
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:48,528
Miss Kajada, l must admit

315
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:51,938
l'm having a tough time
with your theory.

316
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:54,841
Then you're making
a fatal mistake.

317
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:57,311
Three passengers
were on your ship.

318
00:16:57,346 --> 00:16:59,473
Two bodies are in our morgue.

319
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:01,881
Unless the ghost
of Vantika is...

320
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:03,715
Don't patronize me, Commander!

321
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:07,519
lsn't it more likely
that some accomplice did this?

322
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:11,789
Rao Vantika is obsessed
with his own survival.

323
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:15,525
He's prolonged his life
through the use of drugs

324
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:17,465
cryogenics, transplants.

325
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,300
As a medical supervisor
in a high-security penitentiary

326
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:22,634
he used prisoners

327
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:26,233
for his illegal experiments
in cellular longevity.

328
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,937
He's organized raids
on government labs

329
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:31,344
to steal bio-regenerative
research.

330
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,339
l promise you, when he started
that fire on board my ship

331
00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:37,147
he had a plan to survive.

332
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:41,555
l'm not sure what that plan was,
but l'm convinced it succeeded.

333
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:45,960
Doctor, how soon before we get
the results of the DNA trace?

334
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:48,555
l sent it
to Starfleet Command yesterday.

335
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:51,692
They'll have to coordinate
with Kobliad Security.

336
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:53,361
l'd say another 12 hours.

337
00:17:53,402 --> 00:17:57,600
Until then, we will operate
under the assumption

338
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,631
that Vantika is alive.

339
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:06,637
Commander.

340
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:11,312
May l have a word with you?

341
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:16,784
What's on your mind?

342
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:18,851
My resignation.

343
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:20,089
You're overreacting.

344
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:22,256
Oh, so you already
know about this.

345
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:24,266
Yes. Lieutenant Primmin
mentioned to me...

346
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,564
You asked me to stay
in charge of security

347
00:18:26,602 --> 00:18:28,194
when you took command
of this station.

348
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:29,363
l did not ask you.

349
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:32,966
Constable, no one knows
this station like you do.

350
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:34,977
Oh, yes.
l've noticed that.

351
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:37,341
''Constable.''
lt's very cute.

352
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,813
lt's an expression of affection.

353
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:40,475
l believe Major Kira
was the first...

354
00:18:40,516 --> 00:18:42,450
l don't need anyone's affection.

355
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:44,146
l do need clear jurisdiction

356
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:45,710
or l am out.

357
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:51,159
l like you, Odo.

358
00:18:51,193 --> 00:18:54,822
l like to know
where a man stands.

359
00:18:54,864 --> 00:18:58,265
There's never been
any question of that with you.

360
00:18:58,301 --> 00:19:00,428
l need you here.

361
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:03,461
No Starfleet officer
can do the job you do.

362
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:04,530
You've got that straight.

363
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:06,541
But you have to realize
that Starfleet

364
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:08,941
is not going to take command
of a station in deep space

365
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:11,605
without assigning some security
to protect its interests.

366
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:13,877
Understandable.

367
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,816
You're going to have to work
with Primmin.

368
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:18,149
The two of you have to find
a way to get along.

369
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:19,950
Tell him that.

370
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:21,957
l already have.

371
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:23,822
Who's in charge?

372
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:27,795
ln joint operations
like this one...

373
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,730
you are.

374
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,968
l can live
with that arrangement.

375
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:43,471
What have you got, Dax?

376
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:44,979
l'm not exactly sure yet.

377
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:46,572
l finished the sweep
of Kajada's ship.

378
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:48,913
No anomalous readings,
but l did notice one odd thing.

379
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:50,213
What's that?

380
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:52,413
Someone tried to break
into the ship's cargo bay.

381
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:53,922
Since it's been docked?

382
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:56,117
Kira confirmed
that there was no damage

383
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:58,149
to the cargo area
when they brought it in.

384
00:19:58,194 --> 00:19:59,855
What do you think
they were after?

385
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:02,325
This, maybe.

386
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:06,267
l found it in Vantika's
personal belongings.

387
00:20:06,302 --> 00:20:07,394
What is it?

388
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:10,064
A map of the humanoid brain.

389
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,215
You call this clean?

390
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:39,659
l've already found three coins
on the floor up here.

391
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,322
Who knows what else
there might be.

392
00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:43,456
Somebody may have lost
some valuable jewelry

393
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:44,830
or something.

394
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:47,131
Fine.

395
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:48,761
Never mind.

396
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:50,499
l'll do it myself.

397
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:53,167
And l'll keep it myself.

398
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,232
Leave!

399
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:01,476
You just can't find
good help anymore.

400
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:18,296
Have you made
the preparations?

401
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,459
Preparations?

402
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,128
What preparations?

403
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,400
The deuridium shipment.

404
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:27,466
You were to hire
mercenaries to help me.

405
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,136
Help you...

406
00:21:29,178 --> 00:21:32,306
but you can't be Vantika.

407
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:37,148
l told you to expect me
at this hour.

408
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:38,585
Yes, and l contacted

409
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,248
some very reliable
soldiers of fortune

410
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,485
in anticipation of your arrival.

411
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:47,154
But l was told you were dead.

412
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:49,824
Almost...

413
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:52,527
but not quite.

414
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:13,586
You wanted to see me?

415
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:14,919
Kajada.

416
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:17,585
l'll be right with you.

417
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:18,957
There.

418
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:21,929
Now, remember, next time,
lift with your back straight

419
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:24,159
and use the anti-gravity
generator.

420
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,666
l'm sorry.
Come in.

421
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:27,931
l have the DNA scan results.

422
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,530
l thought you might
like to see them.

423
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:33,541
ln fact, l tried
to call you last night.

424
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:36,237
But you never responded
to the com.

425
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:39,247
Um, l have a little
trouble sleeping.

426
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:41,249
Last night was particularly bad

427
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:43,979
so l used an alpha wave inducer
to help me.

428
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,611
Oh, you should
be careful with those.

429
00:22:45,654 --> 00:22:47,281
They're only meant
for occasional use.

430
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:49,119
The scan results, Doctor.

431
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:50,852
Oh, yeah.

432
00:22:50,893 --> 00:22:55,125
There wasn't even a trace
of diploid variation.

433
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:57,222
lt's definitely not a clone.

434
00:22:57,266 --> 00:23:00,793
Positive identification--
Rao Vantika.

435
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:02,326
They must have
overlooked something.

436
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:03,497
Dax to Bashir.

437
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,336
Yes, Jadzia?

438
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:06,671
l need some medical advice.

439
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:07,834
Can you come to my lab?

440
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:09,503
l'll be right there.

441
00:23:09,545 --> 00:23:10,876
Bashir out.

442
00:23:10,913 --> 00:23:14,314
Every conceivable test
has been done, Kajada.

443
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:17,909
Here's the hypothesis.

444
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:20,478
The body dies,
the consciousness lives on.

445
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:21,750
ln another brain?

446
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,814
Possible?

447
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:25,486
Well, the closest thing
l've encountered

448
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:27,654
is synaptic pattern
displacement

449
00:23:27,696 --> 00:23:29,687
but that's never been done
by a non-Vulcan.

450
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:31,699
l'm convinced Vantika
was working on it.

451
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,064
There are over 70 different

452
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:34,693
computer simulations
in his file.

453
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:37,432
All involve identifying
neural energy patterns

454
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,635
and storing them
in different areas of the brain.

455
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:42,644
Well, there's plenty of room.

456
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:45,977
A humanoid only uses
a small portion of the brain.

457
00:23:46,014 --> 00:23:49,074
What if another entity
shared the unused portion?

458
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:50,982
Hypothetically...

459
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:54,989
Vantika's consciousness could be
occupying someone else's brain

460
00:23:55,057 --> 00:23:57,924
while he waits
for the deuridium to arrive.

461
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,224
But whose?

462
00:24:00,262 --> 00:24:02,822
Kajada.

463
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:04,331
They're both Kobliad.

464
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:06,163
What better place to hide

465
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,533
than in the mind
of your worst enemy?

466
00:24:08,604 --> 00:24:10,037
lt doesn't make sense.

467
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:12,040
She's been doing
everything she can

468
00:24:12,074 --> 00:24:14,907
to convince us
that Vantika is alive.

469
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:16,934
lf Vantika's controlling her

470
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:19,343
why would he call
attention to himself?

471
00:24:19,381 --> 00:24:21,474
We're not suggesting
he's controlling her.

472
00:24:21,516 --> 00:24:23,484
This is all theoretical

473
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:25,952
but to extend the logic,
there's no reason to believe

474
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:27,818
she'd even be aware
of his presence.

475
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:30,757
Like a stowaway on a ship--
the pilot's at the helm

476
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:33,090
but someone else
is along for the ride.

477
00:24:33,128 --> 00:24:36,529
Would an examination
of Kajada confirm any of this?

478
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:39,056
We don't know
what we're looking for yet.

479
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:41,569
We still have to identify
a method of transfer first.

480
00:24:41,603 --> 00:24:43,195
l could assign some personnel

481
00:24:43,238 --> 00:24:46,765
to maintain continuous
surveillance on Kajada.

482
00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:48,605
We're already stretched
to the limit

483
00:24:48,644 --> 00:24:49,975
preparing for the shipment.

484
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:51,741
Why don't l just
set the computer

485
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,340
to track her movements
and alert us if she goes

486
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:55,509
near a secured area?

487
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,983
At the very least

488
00:24:57,052 --> 00:24:59,247
she has to be left out
of our security plans.

489
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:00,652
She won't like that.

490
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:03,055
l'm afraid we have no choice.

491
00:25:03,091 --> 00:25:04,251
What do we tell her?

492
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:06,260
Nothing.
She'll figure it out.

493
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:09,127
When she does, send her to me.

494
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:16,296
The computer security
codes have been changed.

495
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:17,737
l've been denied access.

496
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:18,899
Why?

497
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,601
Because l ordered it.

498
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:22,701
What kind of fool are you?

499
00:25:22,744 --> 00:25:25,474
My own special variety.

500
00:25:25,514 --> 00:25:28,176
l'm the only one here
who has experience with Vantika.

501
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:29,274
l'm sorry.

502
00:25:29,317 --> 00:25:33,117
l believe it's necessary
at this point to restrict access

503
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:35,623
to the security files
to four people:

504
00:25:35,657 --> 00:25:39,616
myself, Lieutenant Primmin,
Major Kira and Commander Sisko.

505
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,628
When is the shipment
scheduled to arrive?

506
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:47,032
l can't give you
that information.

507
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:52,472
What about this Ferengi-- Quark?

508
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:54,099
What about him?

509
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:55,609
From what l understand

510
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:57,942
he has his hands
into everything around here.

511
00:25:57,979 --> 00:25:59,571
ls he under surveillance?

512
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:02,082
l always keep an eye on him.

513
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:03,607
l hope so

514
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:05,620
because he's exactly the kind

515
00:26:05,654 --> 00:26:07,645
that Vantika would
use in his plans.

516
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:21,859
Everything has been
taken care of.

517
00:26:21,903 --> 00:26:24,235
That's what you said
about the job on Vener Vll.

518
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:26,934
You should thank me
for Vener Vll.

519
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,737
You got paid, didn't you?

520
00:26:28,777 --> 00:26:30,938
We almost got killed.

521
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:33,846
A normal risk
in your line of work.

522
00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:36,373
A normal risk
when we work for you.

523
00:26:36,418 --> 00:26:37,783
That's for certain.

524
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:41,084
So, when do we
meet this Kobliad?

525
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:43,956
When he decides
it's appropriate.

526
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:46,687
All right, then,
a better question--

527
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:49,390
when do we get paid?

528
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:53,128
When the job is completed,
of course.

529
00:26:53,168 --> 00:26:54,533
Not acceptable.

530
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:57,970
We'll require an advance payment
of 70%.

531
00:26:58,006 --> 00:27:00,270
Durg, wake up.

532
00:27:00,308 --> 00:27:02,799
This is Quark
you're talking to, remember?

533
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:07,372
All past debts
have been settled.

534
00:27:07,415 --> 00:27:08,905
They'll never be settled.

535
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:11,248
You'd still be rotting
in a Cardassian jail

536
00:27:11,286 --> 00:27:12,514
if l hadn't...

537
00:27:33,314 --> 00:27:34,645
Can you speak?

538
00:27:34,682 --> 00:27:37,480
Pushed.

539
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:39,110
Vantika.

540
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:42,088
l can't keep her conscious
any longer, Commander.

541
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:43,919
lf she moves too much

542
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:46,188
she could suffer
permanent paralysis.

543
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:48,353
Did you see anybody
behind her?

544
00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:52,092
l just heard the scream
and looked up.

545
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:53,690
She fell from the balcony.

546
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,702
What was she doing
up there, anyway?

547
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:57,636
She had an odd feeling
you might be

548
00:27:57,671 --> 00:28:00,265
helping someone hijack
this deuridium shipment.

549
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:01,365
l resent the inference.

550
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,397
lt's not an inference.

551
00:28:02,443 --> 00:28:03,671
lt's a definite suspicion.

552
00:28:03,711 --> 00:28:05,679
Was anyone else in the bar?

553
00:28:05,713 --> 00:28:07,180
Anyone else?

554
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:09,341
At the time of the accident.

555
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:10,350
No, just me.

556
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:11,408
Just tidying up

557
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:14,353
which, if you'll excuse me,
l really must finish.

558
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:16,015
Not so fast, Quark.

559
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:19,025
l want to take a look
at that third floor

560
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:21,550
before you get rid
of all the evidence.

561
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:22,892
Be my guest

562
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,899
but l'm telling you,
she was alone up there.

563
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:28,595
And she had no business
invading the privacy

564
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:31,196
of a law-abiding member
of the community.

565
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:34,106
What do you think, Doctor?

566
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:35,904
Could this have been
a suicide attempt?

567
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:37,773
Well, l haven't
noticed any indication

568
00:28:37,811 --> 00:28:39,779
of suicidal behavior,
but then, who knows

569
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:42,907
what the effect of sharing
one's brain might be.

570
00:28:42,983 --> 00:28:45,110
l'd still like
some confirmation of that.

571
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:47,120
l'll have to tend
to her injuries

572
00:28:47,154 --> 00:28:49,122
before l conduct
any brain scan.

573
00:28:49,156 --> 00:28:50,418
But until we find

574
00:28:50,457 --> 00:28:52,584
the transfer method
Vantika used

575
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:55,060
l'm not even sure
what to look for.

576
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:57,461
Computer, location
of Lieutenant Dax.

577
00:28:57,498 --> 00:29:00,296
Lieutenant Dax
is in the stasis room.

578
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,477
Find something
under his fingernails?

579
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:15,880
Not yet.

580
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:17,883
What are you looking for?

581
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:20,545
Confirmation of a theory,
l hope.

582
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:22,555
l've been asking myself

583
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:25,080
why would anyone induct
a bioelectrical charge

584
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,752
into a glial cell?

585
00:29:26,794 --> 00:29:29,126
A question l have
always wondered about.

586
00:29:29,163 --> 00:29:30,596
Well, it might make sense

587
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:32,656
if you wanted to send
a bio-coded message

588
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,168
along the glial cells
of someone's nervous system

589
00:29:35,202 --> 00:29:36,464
all the way to the brain.

590
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:38,130
My guess is

591
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:39,901
that's what Vantika
was trying to do.

592
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,407
Using his fingernails?

593
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:43,842
Frankly, l can't think
of another way

594
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:46,107
he could have delivered
the bio-coded message.

595
00:29:46,146 --> 00:29:49,274
He must have used
a very weak electrical charge

596
00:29:49,316 --> 00:29:52,547
or the sensors on Kajada's ship
would have detected it.

597
00:29:52,586 --> 00:29:55,851
ldeally, he would have injected

598
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:58,881
the bio-coded message directly
into his victim's skin

599
00:29:58,926 --> 00:30:01,394
but there were
no hyposprays or needles

600
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:03,293
anywhere on the ship.

601
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:09,903
A microscopic generator.

602
00:30:09,937 --> 00:30:12,405
You're suggesting he
stored his consciousness

603
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:13,906
in that thing?

604
00:30:13,941 --> 00:30:17,399
His neural patterns encoded
as bioelectrical pulses.

605
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:21,141
He could have placed that device
under his nail months ago

606
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:23,741
just in case he needed an escape
route in an emergency--

607
00:30:23,784 --> 00:30:25,752
his last resort before death.

608
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:28,084
Will this show up
in Kajada?

609
00:30:28,122 --> 00:30:30,590
Now that we know
what we're looking for

610
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:34,424
we should be able to confirm it
with a glial scan.

611
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:37,089
Do it as soon as Bashir
stabilizes her.

612
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:38,291
Nice work.

613
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:49,235
Confirm that each
distribution amplifier

614
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:51,437
is at 100% efficiency.

615
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:54,504
lf there's more
than a .03% fall-off

616
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:55,640
replace it.

617
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:57,411
And that won't mean a thing

618
00:30:57,451 --> 00:30:59,851
if the power waveguide
outlets fail.

619
00:30:59,887 --> 00:31:00,979
Double-check them.

620
00:31:01,054 --> 00:31:02,453
You better make this
the last check.

621
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:03,547
We've only got an hour.

622
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,648
Where's Primmin?

623
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:06,158
l thought he was with you.

624
00:31:06,193 --> 00:31:08,286
l sent him to help you make

625
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:10,455
the final security sweep
of the docking area.

626
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:12,761
He has not been here
all morning.

627
00:31:17,838 --> 00:31:19,806
l won't be going with you.

628
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,741
l'm simply a middleman,
a facilitator.

629
00:31:22,776 --> 00:31:24,744
A profit monger.

630
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:26,575
And proud of it.

631
00:31:26,613 --> 00:31:31,346
How did you get your hands
on a Federation runabout, Quark?

632
00:31:31,385 --> 00:31:33,819
l can't take credit for that.

633
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:36,345
Your employer
has somehow managed

634
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,517
to arrange security access.

635
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:44,719
When do we meet this employer?

636
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:48,633
His message said he'd be
waiting for us on board.

637
00:31:51,438 --> 00:31:53,406
Uh...

638
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,408
uh, l'm terribly sorry.

639
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:58,570
We seem to have made
a wrong turn.

640
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:00,739
We-we didn't mean
to disturb you

641
00:32:00,781 --> 00:32:02,248
Doctor.

642
00:32:08,455 --> 00:32:11,049
Not at all, gentlemen.

643
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:14,390
l've been expecting you.

644
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:24,230
Julian?

645
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:30,274
Computer,
location of Dr. Bashir.

646
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,837
Dr. Bashir is in the lnfirmary.

647
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:49,184
What the hell are
you doing in there?

648
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:51,959
l told you to sweep
the docking bay again.

649
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:53,965
l took a cue from you.

650
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:55,831
From me?

651
00:32:55,869 --> 00:32:58,838
You understood the logic
of Vantika's MO

652
00:32:58,872 --> 00:33:01,705
when he downloaded
the computer memory--

653
00:33:01,742 --> 00:33:04,677
avoid the single file,
attack the system.

654
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:07,145
l'm not following.

655
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,740
Vantika has to know
that all of our security efforts

656
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:11,580
will be focused
on the docking ring.

657
00:33:11,618 --> 00:33:12,778
And...?

658
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:14,514
l figured,
if he holds true to form

659
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:16,385
that's not where
he'll try to hurt us.

660
00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:18,516
So l ran a diagnostic
on all the systems

661
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:20,924
that could shut down
our whole defense array.

662
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:22,586
l've already done
that twice today.

663
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:24,824
l know. l didn't find
anything, either.

664
00:33:24,865 --> 00:33:26,924
But then l went
to the backup systems

665
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,696
and l found a glitch there
l couldn't explain.

666
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:33,638
And l tracked it back
to the waste reclamation system

667
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:36,472
where nobody would ever
think to look

668
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,343
because it's considered
nonessential.

669
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:40,869
And l found this.

670
00:33:40,914 --> 00:33:42,677
Another subspace
crossover shunt

671
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:44,411
just like the one Vantika used

672
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:46,282
when he tapped
into the computer.

673
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,947
And it's set to feed back

674
00:33:48,055 --> 00:33:51,149
into the primary command
and control functions.

675
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,052
This would have shut us
down for close to an hour.

676
00:33:56,096 --> 00:33:58,462
Long enough for him
to grab that freighter

677
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:00,329
and warp it to who knows where.

678
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,902
Yes, Major?

679
00:34:08,976 --> 00:34:11,069
The <i>Norkova's</i> just come
through the wormhole.

680
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:12,738
Requesting permission to dock.

681
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:14,610
Let's go to
a Security Alert Yellow.

682
00:34:14,648 --> 00:34:16,912
What bay do you
have assigned in the plan?

683
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:18,178
Number Eight.

684
00:34:18,218 --> 00:34:19,344
Odo...

685
00:34:19,386 --> 00:34:22,480
maintain a visible contingent
of security at Bay Eight.

686
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:25,320
But l'm sending the <i>Norkova</i>
to the second backup.

687
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,690
Bay 12.

688
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:28,888
l'll send
additional forces to 12.

689
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:31,796
Commander, your
Lieutenant Primmin there

690
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:33,424
just saved us all
a lot of problems.

691
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:36,027
Another subspace crossover
that would have crippled us

692
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:38,560
long enough for them to
escape with your deuridium.

693
00:34:38,605 --> 00:34:40,869
Odo, did you deploy
a runabout

694
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:42,340
to escort the <i>Norkova?</i>

695
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:43,934
No.

696
00:34:43,977 --> 00:34:47,140
Then how come the <i>Rio Grande's</i>
going out to meet it?

697
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,011
On screen.

698
00:34:55,756 --> 00:34:57,519
Benjamin, Julian's missing.

699
00:34:57,557 --> 00:34:58,649
Missing?

700
00:34:58,692 --> 00:35:00,853
His combadge
was in the infirmary.

701
00:35:00,894 --> 00:35:02,020
l can't find him anywhere.

702
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:04,257
Computer, who authorized access

703
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:06,458
to the Runabout <i>Rio Grande?</i>

704
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,264
Authorization:
access code 4-1-2-1.

705
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:11,293
Dr. Julian Bashir.

706
00:35:46,906 --> 00:35:48,464
lt's safe.

707
00:36:01,121 --> 00:36:03,351
Shields up.

708
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,516
Done.

709
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:07,853
Secure the rest of the ship.

710
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:11,853
Be sure to account
for all 12 members of the crew.

711
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:13,990
lf they resist, kill them.

712
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:16,264
Enter the new course.

713
00:36:16,302 --> 00:36:18,293
Aye.

714
00:36:22,142 --> 00:36:26,340
The station has locked
a tractor beam on us.

715
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:28,677
But that's not possible.

716
00:36:28,715 --> 00:36:31,582
They should be shut down by now.

717
00:36:31,618 --> 00:36:33,882
Well, they're not.

718
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:36,046
They're hailing us.

719
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:39,354
Hailing... us?

720
00:36:39,392 --> 00:36:42,361
Engage engines, full impulse.

721
00:36:42,395 --> 00:36:45,853
We're not going anywhere
with a tractor beam on us.

722
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,662
Do it!

723
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:51,364
Full impulse engaged.

724
00:36:51,404 --> 00:36:53,372
The tractor beam is holding.

725
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:57,206
But they won't be able
to pull us in.

726
00:36:57,243 --> 00:37:00,406
We can't just sit here
and wait.

727
00:37:00,447 --> 00:37:03,678
What do you intend to do?

728
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:07,979
Open a channel.

729
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:15,159
l'm Benjamin Sisko,
Commander of DS9.

730
00:37:15,195 --> 00:37:18,790
Rao Vantika is my name.

731
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:28,872
But l assume you
know that already.

732
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:32,240
l want to talk to Dr. Bashir.

733
00:37:32,278 --> 00:37:37,079
Unfortunately, he's not
available at the moment.

734
00:37:37,117 --> 00:37:38,584
ls he all right?

735
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:43,180
His body is--
how do you humans say it?

736
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:45,714
Fit as a fiddle.

737
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:49,593
Looks rather good on me,
don't you think?

738
00:37:49,629 --> 00:37:51,893
What have you done
to his mind, Vantika?

739
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:57,892
lt was necessary to render him
unconscious for the time being.

740
00:37:57,937 --> 00:38:00,497
However, l might consider

741
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,034
leaving his body
and returning him to you.

742
00:38:05,078 --> 00:38:07,842
But first, you must release

743
00:38:07,947 --> 00:38:09,676
your tractor beam.

744
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:11,115
l can't do that.

745
00:38:11,151 --> 00:38:15,713
lf you don't,
l'll take this vessel to warp.

746
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:17,780
The tractor beam
would rip apart your ship.

747
00:38:17,824 --> 00:38:20,088
And you and everybody on board
would be killed.

748
00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:22,185
Exactly.

749
00:38:22,228 --> 00:38:28,224
So if you care at all
about the welfare of your doctor

750
00:38:28,268 --> 00:38:31,863
you will release
your hold on us.

751
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:35,066
You have one minute to decide.

752
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:39,576
Can we get
a transporter lock on him?

753
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:41,876
Negative.
Their shields are up.

754
00:38:41,948 --> 00:38:43,245
Suggestions?

755
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:44,978
A small ship like a runabout

756
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:46,883
might be able
to get close enough

757
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:49,079
to overload
their shield generators

758
00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:50,680
with directed phaser fire.

759
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:53,248
We used to do it to Cardassian
freighters all the time.

760
00:38:53,293 --> 00:38:55,261
But you'd be risking
a hull breach

761
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:57,490
and with all the deuridium
on board...

762
00:38:57,597 --> 00:38:58,825
He's right.

763
00:38:58,865 --> 00:39:02,164
We can't risk releasing
deuridium into the system.

764
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:05,365
Every populated area
would have to be evacuated.

765
00:39:05,405 --> 00:39:07,839
Dax, is there
any way to disrupt

766
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:09,842
Vantika's control over Bashir?

767
00:39:09,876 --> 00:39:11,400
l have an exact model

768
00:39:11,444 --> 00:39:13,742
of Vantika's
neural energy patterns.

769
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,340
lf l can design
an electromagnetic pulse

770
00:39:16,382 --> 00:39:18,077
to disrupt those patterns

771
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:19,414
Julian might emerge.

772
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:22,285
We still need a way
to get it there.

773
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:24,654
Could we run it
along the tractor beam

774
00:39:24,691 --> 00:39:26,022
at the same frequency

775
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:27,185
as their shields?

776
00:39:27,227 --> 00:39:29,593
The pulse would resonate
off the shields

777
00:39:29,629 --> 00:39:32,530
and create a reflected EM
field inside the ship.

778
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:34,192
He's hailing us.

779
00:39:34,234 --> 00:39:36,031
l need some time.

780
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:39,163
l'll give you as much as l can.
On screen.

781
00:39:39,205 --> 00:39:41,230
Have you decided?

782
00:39:41,274 --> 00:39:43,037
lf l permit you to leave

783
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:45,636
what guarantee do l have
that you'll return Dr. Bashir?

784
00:39:45,678 --> 00:39:50,138
Oh, you're far too ready
to capitulate, Commander.

785
00:39:50,183 --> 00:39:55,280
Would you be planning
a rescue attempt, perhaps?

786
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:57,846
l'm only interested
in the safety of my doctor.

787
00:39:57,891 --> 00:40:00,689
You insult my intelligence.

788
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:02,786
Prepare to go to warp.

789
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:05,730
You've gone to great lengths
to survive, Vantika.

790
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:08,461
l don't think you're ready
to kill yourself.

791
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:12,665
And l don't think you are ready

792
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:18,234
to risk spreading deuridium
all over this system.

793
00:40:21,814 --> 00:40:25,215
Ready to engage warp engines.

794
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:26,684
You must be crazy!

795
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,744
l want no part of this!

796
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:37,061
No more middlemen, Sisko.

797
00:40:37,096 --> 00:40:38,893
No more delays.

798
00:40:43,202 --> 00:40:45,670
What's it to be?

799
00:40:45,705 --> 00:40:47,639
All right.

800
00:40:47,674 --> 00:40:50,074
We're prepared to release
the tractor beam.

801
00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:51,576
Dax?

802
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:53,169
Ready.

803
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:54,702
Do it!

804
00:41:05,558 --> 00:41:06,889
Dr. Bashir!

805
00:41:06,926 --> 00:41:08,518
Answer me.

806
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:10,028
Bashir!

807
00:41:11,998 --> 00:41:13,625
Yes?

808
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:14,894
What?

809
00:41:14,968 --> 00:41:17,801
Doctor, lower the shields!

810
00:41:17,837 --> 00:41:19,998
What?

811
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,404
What... what shields?

812
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:22,669
Where am l?

813
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:24,074
l'll explain later.

814
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,271
Lower the shields now!

815
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:36,152
The shields are down.

816
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:37,213
Get him out of there!

817
00:41:37,256 --> 00:41:38,245
Energizing.

818
00:41:45,832 --> 00:41:48,426
lt's okay.

819
00:41:48,468 --> 00:41:49,833
lt's...

820
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:51,496
me.

821
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,675
l've programmed
this transporter

822
00:42:06,716 --> 00:42:10,982
to isolate any glial cells with
Vantika's neural patterns...

823
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,750
and to beam them from Julian

824
00:42:13,789 --> 00:42:16,553
into this
micro-containment field.

825
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:25,796
Once they're out,
he should be back to normal.

826
00:43:03,973 --> 00:43:06,498
l'm only reading
human neural patterns.

827
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,873
He's clear.

828
00:43:23,693 --> 00:43:27,527
Oh, l have the worst headache.

829
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,577
Dr. Bashir, l'm so sorry
for all of this.

830
00:43:44,613 --> 00:43:46,638
Well, l suppose we should
have listened to you

831
00:43:46,682 --> 00:43:48,707
when you said he was alive.

832
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,616
There was no way
for you to control

833
00:43:50,653 --> 00:43:52,018
what he was doing to you.

834
00:43:52,054 --> 00:43:55,785
l'm afraid l don't remember it.

835
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:59,124
Actually, l feel
quite humiliated.

836
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:00,992
No one blames you, Doctor.

837
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,430
lt wasn't you.

838
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:05,366
lt was that.

839
00:44:05,401 --> 00:44:08,564
What do you intend to do
with it?

840
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,198
May l assume that you've
returned custody

841
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,708
of the prisoner to me,
Commander Sisko?

842
00:44:13,743 --> 00:44:15,074
The prisoner?

843
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,476
What's left of him.

844
00:44:16,512 --> 00:44:18,070
Good.
