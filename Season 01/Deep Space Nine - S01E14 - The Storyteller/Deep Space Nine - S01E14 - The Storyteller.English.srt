1
00:00:02,194 --> 00:00:05,823
Station Log, Stardate 46729.1.

2
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:07,593
The Bajoran government
has asked me

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:08,895
to mediate a disagreement

4
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:12,426
between two rival factions,
the Paqu and the Navot.

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,166
At issue is a land dispute

6
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:16,299
which could trigger
a civil war.

7
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:20,334
Commander, the Paqu delegation
has arrived at Docking Port 6.

8
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,937
Let's welcome them aboard.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,641
Dax, any word on the Navot?

10
00:00:23,682 --> 00:00:25,843
They should be here
within the hour.

11
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:27,181
Excuse me, Commander.

12
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:29,846
Chief, l thought you'd be
on your way to Bajor by now.

13
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:31,822
We're due to leave any moment.

14
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,484
But, sir, l was wondering

15
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:36,323
if, perhaps, Ensign Boyer
might replace me

16
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,192
on this particular mission.

17
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,198
After all, l'd be little more
than a chauffeur

18
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:42,860
and Boyer can pilot a runabout
just as well as l can.

19
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,198
Has something come up

20
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:46,464
that requires your presence
on the station, Chief?

21
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,996
No, sir. Everything's
running smoothly for a change.

22
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,066
But around here, you never know.

23
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:53,407
Ah, Chief, there you are.
All set to go?

24
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:54,537
Yes, sir.

25
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,945
Commander, did the Magistrate
give any indication

26
00:00:56,982 --> 00:00:59,143
as to the nature
of this medical emergency?

27
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,551
Only that his village
was in danger of extinction.

28
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:04,316
ln that case,
we'd better be on our way.

29
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:05,687
l agree.

30
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:06,691
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:07,817
Docking Port 6.

32
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,917
You know, Chief, in a way

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,155
l'm really looking forward
to this mission.

34
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,356
And why is that?

35
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:13,887
Well, l see it
as a wonderful opportunity

36
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:15,160
for us to get
to know each other.

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,690
Oh.

38
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,441
l'd like you to set
a preliminary meeting

39
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:26,967
with both sides
for later this afternoon.

40
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:29,879
Make sure they know that this
is an informal session.

41
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:32,440
l just want to get them
talking to each other.

42
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:35,715
Just getting them to sit down
at the same table

43
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:37,585
will be an accomplishment.

44
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:40,955
Sir, about these negotiations...

45
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:42,459
You have some advice for me?

46
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,963
There's an old saying on Bajor.

47
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:49,466
''The land and the people
are one.''

48
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:52,834
Well, the land inhabited
by the Paqu and the Navot

49
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:55,362
is some of the harshest
on the planet.

50
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:56,567
Relax, Major.

51
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:59,202
This is not my first time
up at the plate.

52
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,212
Sir...

53
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,407
Besides, l'll have you
by my side

54
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:05,678
to help me avoid
making mistakes.

55
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:08,880
Tell me what you know
about the Paqu Tetrarch.

56
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,148
Not much.

57
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:13,350
The Paqu choose to avoid
contact with outsiders.

58
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:18,757
Commander Sisko?

59
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:19,889
Yes?

60
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,458
l am Varis Sul,
Tetrarch of the Paqu.

61
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:43,694
Chief, may l ask you a question?

62
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,890
Of course.

63
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,831
And l'd like an honest answer.

64
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:48,663
You'll get one.

65
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:51,068
Do l...

66
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:53,095
annoy you?

67
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:55,107
Annoy me?

68
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:56,802
What sort of a question
is that?

69
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:58,276
Well, the thing is,
we've just spent

70
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:00,279
the last two hours alone
together in this runabout

71
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:02,338
and you've hardly said
a word to me the whole time.

72
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:04,213
Really?
l hadn't noticed.

73
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,946
Oh, l see.

74
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:09,217
l suppose it's because
l was too busy thinking.

75
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:10,347
Thinking?

76
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,482
That's right.

77
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:12,491
About what?

78
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:13,492
What?

79
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:15,050
What were you thinking about?

80
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,321
l'm just curious.

81
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:18,923
Well, let's see, um...

82
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,866
l was thinking that when
we get back to the station

83
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:24,028
l'll have to run
a level-1 diagnostic

84
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,732
on the phase coil generators.

85
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:28,536
Satisfied?

86
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:29,906
l suppose so.

87
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:31,808
Glad to hear it.

88
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:33,335
l mean, the only reason
l bring it up

89
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,075
is because your opinion
means a lot to me

90
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,514
and l'm aware
that l have a tendency

91
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:37,914
to run off at the mouth
sometimes.

92
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:38,918
ls that a fact?

93
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:40,613
l suppose it's just
a nervous habit.

94
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:42,349
l hope you don't
hold it against me.

95
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:43,549
Oh, not at all, sir.

96
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:46,791
And one more thing.

97
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:48,691
What's that, sir?

98
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:51,219
l don't think
it's really necessary

99
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,232
to call me ''sir.''

100
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,790
What should l call you?

101
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,495
You're my superior officer.

102
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:58,026
How about Julian?

103
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:00,773
ls that an order?

104
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:01,899
Oh, no, of course not.

105
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:04,307
lt's just that l'd
simply prefer it

106
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,642
if you called me
by my first name.

107
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,013
All right.

108
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:20,681
We've achieved
stable orbit around Bajor.

109
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:24,026
We can beam down any time...

110
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:25,725
Julian.

111
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,248
No sign
of any airborne infections.

112
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:44,876
The soil appears to be
free of pollutants

113
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:47,716
and the groundwater clear
of bacterial contamination.

114
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:48,880
Gentlemen.

115
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:51,322
l am Faren Kag,
the village magistrate.

116
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:53,723
l'm Dr. Bashir.
This is Chief O'Brien.

117
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,990
This village
is in great jeopardy.

118
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,088
l only hope you're not too late.

119
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:06,331
Has he shown
any sign of improvement?

120
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:07,862
None.

121
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,843
You must help him.

122
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:13,675
How many others are sick?

123
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:14,680
Others?

124
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:17,842
You said the entire village
was in jeopardy.

125
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,681
lt is.

126
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:22,381
lf he dies, we all die.

127
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,959
l'll say this
for the Cardassians--

128
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:34,023
their replicators
make a fine <i>larish</i> pie.

129
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,796
l didn't come here
to eat, Commander.

130
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:37,427
Then let's talk.

131
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,995
The official negotiations
don't begin until tonight

132
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,439
but l thought it
might be a good idea

133
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:45,069
that we meet informally
to see where we all stand.

134
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,645
According to the treaty

135
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:49,079
that has existed between you
for the past 90 years

136
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:52,175
''the border separating
the Paqu and the Navot

137
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:54,584
shall forever be
the river Glyrhond.''

138
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,282
That's correct.

139
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:59,653
Well, at least
we all agree on something.

140
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:01,990
Now, as l understand it,
during the occupation

141
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:04,019
the Cardassians
diverted the river

142
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,156
for use
in their mining operations.

143
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,292
As a result,
the Glyrhond now flows

144
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:10,894
20 kilometers west
of its former position.

145
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:13,405
20 kilometers
into Navot territory.

146
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,168
That's Paqu territory now.

147
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,470
You read the treaty, Commander.

148
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:19,672
The river is our common border.

149
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:22,681
The treaty says nothing
about stealing land.

150
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,376
lf your father was alive

151
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,044
he would give us back
what is ours.

152
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:28,052
My father would do
no such thing.

153
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:31,056
Besides, l'm Tetrarch now.

154
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:34,355
l will not be pressured
into betraying my people.

155
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,692
Let's see...

156
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,357
two Bajoran synthales

157
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,197
a glass of Gamzian wine

158
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:47,036
and a Trixian bubble juice
for the little lady.

159
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:50,406
l'm not a little lady.

160
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,011
l'm still charging her
for that drink.

161
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:19,402
Oh.

162
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,970
Nog, we've been sitting
here over an hour.

163
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,671
Let's go play some ball
in the holosuite.

164
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:26,838
No!

165
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,177
Why not?

166
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:29,841
Because baseball
is slow and boring.

167
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:31,510
And you can't hit
my curve ball.

168
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:32,848
lt's a stupid game

169
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:35,980
that even humans stopped playing
hundreds of years ago.

170
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:38,855
Maybe, but you still
can't hit my curve ball.

171
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:41,622
Mr. Sisko, Nog,
l thought l told you

172
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:44,186
no dangling over the Promenade.

173
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,061
We're not going to fall, Odo.

174
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,363
We can see things
better from down here.

175
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:52,701
And what, may l ask,
is so interesting?

176
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,536
Nothing.

177
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,872
ln that case,
you can see ''nothing''

178
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,707
just as well from up here.

179
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:01,578
Now, on your feet.

180
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:07,909
Thank you.

181
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:14,393
Are you going to come

182
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:15,985
to the holosuite
with me, or not?

183
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:19,021
Come on, we could have Buck
Bokai hit a few out to us.

184
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,625
He was the greatest
hitter of all time.

185
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:23,727
l'll even let you use my glove.

186
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,929
l have never seen anything
so beautiful.

187
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:29,257
She's all right.

188
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:30,526
All right?

189
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:32,727
l have to meet her.

190
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:50,881
Ah! The Dal'Rok.

191
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,045
Easy now.

192
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:54,715
Try not to exert yourself.

193
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:56,054
Huh? Hovath...

194
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:57,388
l'm here.
l'm right here.

195
00:10:57,426 --> 00:10:58,484
The time...

196
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,654
lt's still two hours
before nightfall.

197
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:02,493
You should have wakened me.

198
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:03,998
Help me to get dressed.

199
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:07,992
l'm afraid you're
in no shape to go anywhere.

200
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:11,165
The Prophets sent you,
didn't they?

201
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:12,468
l beg your pardon?

202
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:18,677
No, there's something wrong.

203
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:21,842
lt must be your companion.

204
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:23,681
You mean Chief O'Brien?

205
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:25,186
Bring him to me.

206
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,687
Why?

207
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:31,352
Because you are not the one
l have been waiting for.

208
00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:32,860
Chief?

209
00:11:32,895 --> 00:11:35,363
He wants to see you.

210
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:37,388
Come.

211
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:43,394
Closer.

212
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:50,711
Oh, l knew.

213
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:55,877
l knew the Prophets
would not fail us.

214
00:11:55,918 --> 00:11:58,648
You may leave now.

215
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:00,678
Both of you.

216
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:05,182
See that he stays in bed.

217
00:12:09,998 --> 00:12:11,329
What was that all about?

218
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:12,492
l haven't a clue.

219
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,001
The Sirah, how is he?

220
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:15,663
l wish l had better news.

221
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:17,695
He's suffering
from systemic organ failure

222
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:20,299
brought on by an accelerated
rate of cellular decay.

223
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:22,674
His body is surrendering
to old age.

224
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:23,939
ls there anything you can do?

225
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:25,003
l can keep him comfortable

226
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:26,207
and relatively free of pain.

227
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:28,045
Other than that,
it's just a matter of time.

228
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,174
l'm sorry.

229
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:30,344
But we need him.

230
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:32,148
The Dal'Rok will be here soon.

231
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,313
What's the Dal'Rok?

232
00:12:35,357 --> 00:12:36,756
lt's a terrible creature

233
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:38,623
that lives in the woods
just north of the village.

234
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,651
Every year at the end
of harvest, it appears.

235
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:42,994
And you say
it's coming here tonight?

236
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,521
Yes, it always comes
for five nights.

237
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,056
This will be the fourth--

238
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:49,262
and only the Sirah is
strong enough to defeat it.

239
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:50,566
Well, right now

240
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:53,871
the Sirah isn't strong enough
to get out of bed.

241
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:56,036
lf what you say is true

242
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,842
this village will be
destroyed tonight.

243
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,350
You're sure this is the place?

244
00:13:11,393 --> 00:13:12,724
You saw the readout.

245
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:16,356
There's only one female her age
visiting the station

246
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:18,798
and these are her quarters.

247
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:26,031
Well, go ahead.

248
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:27,268
What?

249
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:28,401
Ring the bell.

250
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:30,843
Me? You are the one
who wants to meet her.

251
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,176
Are you afraid?

252
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:33,181
Of a girl?

253
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:34,182
Then ring.

254
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:35,205
You ring!

255
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,717
You are afraid.

256
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:38,583
No, l'm not, you are.

257
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:42,522
What are you doing?

258
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:45,724
My name's Jog...

259
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:47,558
l mean Jake.

260
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,223
l...

261
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:51,255
He's Nog.
l'm Jake Sisko.

262
00:13:54,436 --> 00:13:55,767
Sisko...

263
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:57,362
We're kind of

264
00:13:57,406 --> 00:14:00,500
the unofficial welcoming
committee around here.

265
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,032
That's right.

266
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:05,513
Welcome to DS9.

267
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:08,015
Thank you.
l'm Varis Sul.

268
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,143
Would you like a tour
of the station?

269
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:12,380
There's a Klingon freighter
leaving for the Gamma Quadrant

270
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:13,388
in a little while.

271
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:15,322
We could watch it
go through the wormhole.

272
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:16,984
Good-good-good idea.

273
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,617
Thanks.

274
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,957
So, how about it?

275
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:21,622
You want to go?

276
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:24,188
l've never seen the wormhole.

277
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,700
Then you're in luck

278
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:28,259
'cause we know
the best spot on the station

279
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:29,861
for wormhole-watching.

280
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:32,271
Unless you're busy or something.

281
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:33,968
Not at the moment.

282
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:45,646
Listen to me, Sirah.

283
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:48,178
You must return to bed.

284
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:52,057
To be out here,
in your condition...

285
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:54,358
Your concern touches me, Doctor

286
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:59,299
but l am now in the hands
of the Prophets.

287
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:00,631
We believe in you.

288
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:01,761
Help us, Sirah.

289
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,694
Strange...

290
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:36,727
l'm not registering
any atmospheric disturbance.

291
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:40,606
The Dal'Rok wakes...

292
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,272
but we are ready.

293
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:55,955
ln the shadow of the night,
he hungers.

294
00:15:55,991 --> 00:16:00,052
With a hatred of the ancients,
he rages.

295
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:04,724
From the twisted pit of chaos,
he approaches.

296
00:16:12,107 --> 00:16:13,836
ls it alive?

297
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:17,106
The tricorder's still
not picking up anything.

298
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:22,014
Could it be some kind
of holographic image?

299
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,677
No.

300
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:26,711
l'm not picking up
any power source.

301
00:16:26,755 --> 00:16:28,848
The Dal'Rok's anger

302
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,350
is like a wave crashing down
upon the village.

303
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:39,197
The weight of its fury
threatens to crush us all.

304
00:16:39,234 --> 00:16:44,103
The Dal'Rok thinks the village
is powerless to defend itself...

305
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:54,010
but the Dal'Rok is mistaken.

306
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:56,847
The village is strong--

307
00:16:56,885 --> 00:17:01,821
much stronger than the Dal'Rok
can ever imagine.

308
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,621
The village is strong!

309
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,725
The village is strong!

310
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,499
With our strength, our unity

311
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,802
we shall drive the Dal'Rok...

312
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,378
Bloody hell!

313
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,664
Chief!

314
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,100
Help us get him down from here!

315
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,601
Where is my successor?

316
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,403
Sirah...

317
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,910
No. The one
whom the Prophets sent.

318
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,778
Yes, you.

319
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,873
W-wait a second.

320
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,214
l think you got the wrong guy.

321
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,379
Say what l say.

322
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,913
The village shall
not be destroyed.

323
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:12,925
What?!

324
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,586
Quickly.

325
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,562
The village
shall not be destroyed.

326
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,498
Louder, so they can all hear.

327
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,468
The village

328
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,835
shall not be destroyed!

329
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,703
Despite our fears

330
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,369
we shall stand our ground

331
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,742
and face the Dal'Rok.

332
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,178
Despite our fears

333
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,809
we shall stand our ground

334
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,411
and face the Dal'Rok.

335
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,416
The village is strong.

336
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:54,894
More powerful than the Dal'Rok.

337
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,572
Together, we use that power

338
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,076
to drive it away.

339
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:12,074
Drive it away!
Drive it away!

340
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,827
The Dal'Rok is defeated.

341
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,559
The village is safe.

342
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,614
He's dead.

343
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,457
The Sirah has left us

344
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:57,952
but the Prophets have sent us
his successor.

345
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,098
A new Sirah to tell the story.

346
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,137
Story, the story!

347
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,505
A new Sirah
to protect the village.

348
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,612
So l sold them a whole herd
of Klingon <i>targs.</i>

349
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,126
Major, what a pleasant surprise.

350
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,593
l always look forward

351
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,858
to one
of your infrequent visits.

352
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,355
Spare me the small talk
and get me a stardrifter.

353
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,130
So, uh...

354
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,663
how are the negotiations
coming along?

355
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,572
Better make it a double.

356
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,201
Ah.

357
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,845
You asked to see me?

358
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,875
Please, sit down.

359
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,616
l just spent
the last five hours sitting.

360
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,955
Yes, five long,
unproductive hours.

361
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,790
Woban is an obstinate fool.

362
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,261
Woban is here to talk.

363
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,729
What are you here for?

364
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,789
l would think that was obvious--

365
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,358
to protect the interests
of my people.

366
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,494
How, by starting a war?

367
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,402
l object to your tone,
Commander.

368
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,997
Because if that's
what you're here for--

369
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,008
if you'd rather
fight than talk--

370
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,532
then we're just
wasting our time.

371
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,408
That land belongs to the Paqu.

372
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,845
The Navot don't agree.

373
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,577
Then they'd better be ready
to die for it.

374
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,881
l am.

375
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,443
Or don't you believe me?

376
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,352
l believe in people
working together

377
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,914
to find reasonable solutions
to their problems.

378
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,448
l hope you do as well.

379
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,462
What you hope
is no concern of mine.

380
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,124
Now, anything else
you wish to say to me

381
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,431
can be said tomorrow
across a conference table.

382
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,766
Varis...

383
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,966
are you sure your people
are as ready as you are

384
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,474
to die for that land?

385
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,611
Where do you think she is?

386
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,123
l guess if she's not here,
we'll try again at her quarters.

387
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,250
When we find her,
let me do the talking.

388
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,954
She asked me questions,
l answered them.

389
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,983
What's wrong with that?

390
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,497
Just remember, l saw her first.

391
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,691
She's mine.

392
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,996
Then how come you can barely
say two words to her

393
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,466
without getting tongue-tied?

394
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,492
That's a lie!

395
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,471
l've never seen you so nervous.

396
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,167
You must really like her.

397
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,108
l never said that!

398
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,008
All l said was...

399
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,110
We were just...

400
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,776
Looking for you.

401
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,978
l've been busy.

402
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,714
ls something wrong?

403
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,621
You seem a little depressed.

404
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,751
lt's nothing, really.

405
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,126
lt's just...

406
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:47,724
there are these people
who want something l have

407
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,200
and l refuse to give it to them.

408
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,261
How badly do they want it?

409
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,239
Very badly.

410
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:58,038
ls there anything they have
that you want?

411
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,974
That l want.

412
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,537
Maybe this isn't a problem.

413
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,639
Maybe...

414
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,150
it's an opportunity.

415
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,653
Maybe.

416
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,485
When l have a problem
l can't figure out

417
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,820
l ask my dad.

418
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,621
l ask my dad, too.

419
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,390
lt helps, doesn't it?

420
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,623
Yeah.

421
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:19,926
No.

422
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:20,989
My dad's

423
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,091
a pretty smart guy.

424
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,695
Mine, too...

425
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,002
in his own way.

426
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:31,599
My parents are dead.

427
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,943
They were killed
by the Cardassians.

428
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,448
l'm sorry.

429
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:41,783
My mom was killed
during an attack by the Borg.

430
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,186
lsn't there someone
you can talk to?

431
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,451
Someone you trust?

432
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,288
l don't trust many people.

433
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,486
My dad says...

434
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,017
Could we please talk
about something

435
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,084
besides your father?

436
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,964
You admire him very much,
don't you?

437
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,298
l trust him.

438
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,633
Mr. Sisko...

439
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,798
Odo.

440
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,602
We were just leaving.

441
00:24:09,986 --> 00:24:12,784
l wonder what was controlling
those energy creatures.

442
00:24:12,822 --> 00:24:14,790
One thing's certain--
it wasn't me.

443
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:16,451
Try telling the villagers that.

444
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:18,859
They saw the Sirah choose you
as his successor.

445
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:20,089
Well, he made a mistake.

446
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,098
You saw the way he greeted you
when we arrived.

447
00:24:22,132 --> 00:24:24,464
lt was as if he
was expecting you.

448
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:25,763
But l'll tell you this, Chief

449
00:24:25,802 --> 00:24:27,531
l'm glad you came along
on this mission

450
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,867
because if it wasn't for you

451
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:30,805
l'd have done what l could
for the Sirah and left

452
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,137
and look what l
would have missed.

453
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:34,643
Well, l'm glad you're
enjoying yourself, Julian.

454
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:37,146
Don't worry, Chief,
l have faith in you.

455
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,238
Oh, do you?!

456
00:24:38,281 --> 00:24:40,647
l mean, for all we know

457
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:42,584
you really were sent
by the Prophets.

458
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,985
l was sent by Commander Sisko.

459
00:24:45,088 --> 00:24:47,886
This Dal'Rok, or whatever

460
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:49,289
will be returning this evening

461
00:24:49,326 --> 00:24:51,920
and everybody's counting
on me to be able to stop it.

462
00:24:51,962 --> 00:24:53,554
The only trouble is

463
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:57,032
l don't have the slightest idea
how l'm supposed to do that.

464
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:01,566
These gifts are for you, Sirah.

465
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:03,299
Well, look,
tell them l don't want them.

466
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,432
Oh, bring them in.

467
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:06,169
Put them wherever you like.

468
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,608
Now, look, Julian...

469
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:13,411
We're visitors here, Chief.

470
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,941
lt would be impolite
to refuse our hosts.

471
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,884
Thank you, Sirah.

472
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:24,326
How can l help you, ladies?

473
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:28,889
l think they're the ones
offering services, Chief.

474
00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:32,663
Now, look, t-there's been
a serious misunderstanding.

475
00:25:32,702 --> 00:25:34,533
ls there a problem, Sirah?

476
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:35,936
No! They're not...

477
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:38,304
Well, yes...

478
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:40,434
l mean, they're quite...

479
00:25:40,477 --> 00:25:44,436
Look, l have a wife
and daughter back on DS9.

480
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:46,244
Of course.

481
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:49,979
You must send for them.

482
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,317
Why?

483
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:53,584
So they can live here with you.

484
00:25:53,623 --> 00:25:56,091
No, you're missing the point.

485
00:25:56,126 --> 00:25:57,559
l'm not staying.

486
00:25:57,594 --> 00:25:59,824
Then, who will tell the story?

487
00:25:59,863 --> 00:26:03,663
Well, you'll just
have to find someone else.

488
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,031
But there is no one else.

489
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:06,365
The Sirah chose you.

490
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:07,665
He made a mistake.

491
00:26:07,704 --> 00:26:09,296
But what about the Dal'Rok?

492
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:10,931
Without your protection,
it will kill us all.

493
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:14,170
Faren, l would like
to help, really l would

494
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,939
but l don't know how.

495
00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:18,037
You must tell the story.

496
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:20,174
Simple as that, is it?

497
00:26:21,818 --> 00:26:25,447
May the Prophets
grant you victory, Sirah.

498
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:26,978
Let's hope so.

499
00:26:42,272 --> 00:26:44,433
Now what are we going to do?

500
00:26:44,474 --> 00:26:48,274
The way l see it,
the only way out of this mess

501
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:52,179
is to find out exactly
what this Dal'Rok is

502
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:55,651
and destroy it
before it destroys us.

503
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:02,214
Station Log, supplemental.

504
00:27:02,258 --> 00:27:04,089
We have completed
a second day of talks

505
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:06,095
between the Paqu and the Navot.

506
00:27:06,129 --> 00:27:08,529
So far, we're no closer
to finding a solution

507
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:11,500
than we were
when negotiations began.

508
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:17,302
Enter.

509
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,808
Hi. You want to do something?

510
00:27:19,843 --> 00:27:22,812
Sorry, not right now.

511
00:27:24,013 --> 00:27:27,312
Okay, we'll stop by later.

512
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,514
ls there anything we can do
to cheer you up?

513
00:27:31,554 --> 00:27:34,114
l don't think so.

514
00:27:34,157 --> 00:27:36,148
You sure?

515
00:27:36,192 --> 00:27:38,160
Let's go before
you embarrass yourself.

516
00:27:38,194 --> 00:27:39,218
Wait.

517
00:27:39,262 --> 00:27:40,593
Yes?

518
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:45,593
Do you remember
that opportunity

519
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:47,967
we were discussing yesterday?

520
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:49,766
Yes.

521
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:51,296
How can you be sure

522
00:27:51,341 --> 00:27:54,310
that an opportunity
is worth the risk?

523
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:56,812
Ah. lnstinct.

524
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:59,644
The Ninth Rule of Acquisition
clearly states

525
00:27:59,682 --> 00:28:04,051
that opportunity plus instinct
equals profit.

526
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:06,385
lnstinct...

527
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:08,652
That's not going to help.

528
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:10,591
l think it does.

529
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:12,595
Thank you, Nog.

530
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:13,823
Good!

531
00:28:13,863 --> 00:28:16,559
Let's celebrate.

532
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,793
Celebrate?

533
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:19,768
l took one
of my uncle's security rods.

534
00:28:19,802 --> 00:28:22,327
What are we going
to do with that?

535
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:23,600
l don't know.

536
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,801
We could swipe Odo's bucket.

537
00:28:25,842 --> 00:28:27,104
Are you kidding?

538
00:28:27,143 --> 00:28:28,167
A bucket?

539
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:29,269
Yeah.
We'll give it back.

540
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,279
Yeah, but...

541
00:28:30,313 --> 00:28:31,280
lt'll be funny.

542
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:33,339
But we can't just walk
into Security.

543
00:28:33,383 --> 00:28:34,975
Watch me.

544
00:28:48,698 --> 00:28:52,099
Wait over there.

545
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:55,832
l still don't understand
what's so funny about a bucket.

546
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:57,339
Odo lives in it.

547
00:28:57,373 --> 00:28:58,567
He's a shape-shifter.

548
00:28:58,608 --> 00:28:59,632
Every 16 hours

549
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:01,871
he has to change back
to his original form.

550
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:03,310
lnside a bucket?

551
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:05,940
He turns
into some kind of liquid.

552
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,679
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

553
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:14,019
Watch the front door.

554
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:15,251
l'll be right back.

555
00:29:21,264 --> 00:29:23,926
Jake, are you sure
this is all right?

556
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,766
Well, it's not like we're
really stealing anything.

557
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:28,998
Found it.

558
00:29:30,073 --> 00:29:31,734
Oops!

559
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:33,435
Odo!

560
00:29:35,178 --> 00:29:37,203
Odo!

561
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:39,909
lt's oatmeal.

562
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:42,941
l filled it
from the replicator.

563
00:29:42,986 --> 00:29:44,783
Very funny!

564
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:51,052
You should have seen your face.

565
00:30:10,313 --> 00:30:12,508
l believe that belongs to me.

566
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:21,423
What's the rush?

567
00:30:47,784 --> 00:30:49,274
There's some residual
neutrino levels

568
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,843
in the microstructure
of these rocks.

569
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:52,718
But if the Dal'Rok has
no physical substance

570
00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:54,746
how can it leave
a neutrino trace?

571
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:57,351
l didn't say it made sense,
but this rock face

572
00:30:57,393 --> 00:30:59,827
didn't just spontaneously
blow itself to pieces.

573
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:01,727
Lucky for us,
you managed to stop it

574
00:31:01,764 --> 00:31:03,493
before it did any more damage.

575
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:06,058
All l did was repeat
what the Sirah told me.

576
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:08,127
ln that case, how did the
Sirah manage to stop it?

577
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:10,662
Good question.

578
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,732
Maybe there's
a control mechanism

579
00:31:12,775 --> 00:31:13,799
hidden somewhere.

580
00:31:13,843 --> 00:31:14,810
Excuse me, miss.

581
00:31:14,844 --> 00:31:16,612
Please, Sirah, for my daughter.

582
00:31:16,745 --> 00:31:17,871
What about her?

583
00:31:17,913 --> 00:31:21,872
lt looks like she wants you
to bless her child.

584
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:22,941
Me?!

585
00:31:23,052 --> 00:31:25,987
lt would mean so much.

586
00:31:33,162 --> 00:31:35,892
l'm sure she'll make
you very proud.

587
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:36,955
Oh, thank you.

588
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:38,226
Thank you.

589
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:39,234
There he is.

590
00:31:39,268 --> 00:31:40,235
You're quite welcome.

591
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:41,759
Looks like more
of your followers

592
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:43,101
are requesting an audience.

593
00:31:43,138 --> 00:31:44,298
Oh, no.
This won't do.

594
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:46,102
Um, you continue
looking around here.

595
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:47,904
l'm going to check
the Sirah's room.

596
00:31:47,943 --> 00:31:48,910
Please, please.

597
00:31:48,944 --> 00:31:52,971
l'm afraid the Sirah
is busy at the moment.

598
00:31:53,082 --> 00:31:55,073
Perhaps l could be of service.

599
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:56,516
Sirah, come back!

600
00:31:56,552 --> 00:31:57,883
Please, Sirah, a moment.

601
00:32:26,815 --> 00:32:29,807
Look, l could use some privacy.

602
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:33,447
There are more gifts
outside for you.

603
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:36,287
All right, bring them in.

604
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:37,952
Hold on.

605
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:40,460
Didn't you work for the Sirah?

606
00:32:40,496 --> 00:32:41,861
Mm-hmm.

607
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:43,524
l, um...

608
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:45,396
l was his apprentice.

609
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:50,133
Oh. Did he ever reveal
any of his secrets?

610
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:53,403
How he controlled the Dal'Rok
and that sort of thing?

611
00:32:53,442 --> 00:32:54,636
Why ask me?

612
00:32:54,676 --> 00:32:57,645
Surely, the Sirah
must have taught you

613
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,271
all you need to know.

614
00:32:59,314 --> 00:33:00,372
Oh, all right!

615
00:33:00,415 --> 00:33:01,712
Have it your way.

616
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,412
Don't blame me
when that creature

617
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:07,286
goes rampaging
through your village.

618
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:15,790
Chief!

619
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:19,798
Careful.

620
00:33:19,835 --> 00:33:21,393
Don't hurt him.

621
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:23,131
l'll try not to.

622
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:26,498
That's enough.

623
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:27,634
Tell him that.

624
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:30,802
l said, that's enough!

625
00:33:35,918 --> 00:33:38,944
Now, you mind explaining
why you tried to kill me?

626
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:46,624
You are not the true Sirah.

627
00:33:46,662 --> 00:33:50,291
You won't get
any argument from me.

628
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,323
lf he isn't, who is?

629
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:54,494
l am.

630
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:09,847
For nine years,
l studied with the Sirah

631
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:15,517
learning the secrets
of the storyteller

632
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:19,755
only to have you come
along and take my place.

633
00:34:19,795 --> 00:34:22,025
Look, friend,
as far as l'm concerned

634
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:23,224
the job's yours.

635
00:34:23,265 --> 00:34:25,130
But if you were
supposed to take over

636
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,634
how come the Sirah chose him?

637
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:28,260
lt was his way of punishing me.

638
00:34:28,303 --> 00:34:30,931
Punishing you?

639
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:32,065
Three nights ago

640
00:34:32,107 --> 00:34:34,701
the Sirah allowed me
to tell the story

641
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:39,578
but when the Dal'Rok appeared,
l was unable to control it.

642
00:34:39,615 --> 00:34:41,947
Several people were injured.

643
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:43,382
Control it, how?

644
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:45,215
With this.

645
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:48,246
This stone is said to be
a fragment of an Orb

646
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,951
from the Celestial Temple.

647
00:34:50,058 --> 00:34:53,084
We had one of those Orbs
aboard our station.

648
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:55,619
We're aware
of how powerful they are.

649
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:58,895
Many years ago, this village
was deeply divided

650
00:34:58,934 --> 00:35:00,401
by hate and mistrust.

651
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:04,030
The first Sirah knew
that unless he could find a way

652
00:35:04,072 --> 00:35:07,303
to unite the people, the village
would destroy itself

653
00:35:07,342 --> 00:35:10,641
so he used the Orb fragment
as a catalyst

654
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:13,614
to give their fears
a physical form.

655
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:17,244
So the villagers' thoughts
create the Dal'Rok.

656
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:20,084
Yes, but they don't know that.

657
00:35:20,122 --> 00:35:24,616
lt's a secret which is passed
from Sirah to Sirah.

658
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,491
Why do they need a storyteller?

659
00:35:26,528 --> 00:35:29,793
The story helps to focus
the villagers' thoughts.

660
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:32,493
And that enables them
to defeat the Dal'Rok

661
00:35:32,534 --> 00:35:34,468
by creating
the shimmering lights.

662
00:35:36,138 --> 00:35:39,630
l know, if l had another chance,
l could control the Dal'Rok.

663
00:35:40,976 --> 00:35:42,841
Well, son

664
00:35:42,878 --> 00:35:44,573
it looks like tonight

665
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:47,241
you are going
to get that chance.

666
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,150
What is this?

667
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:58,659
You have no right
to wear those clothes.

668
00:35:58,694 --> 00:35:59,888
l have every right.

669
00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:01,395
You had your chance
to prove yourself.

670
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,397
You failed.

671
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:03,898
lt won't happen again.

672
00:36:03,932 --> 00:36:04,899
That's right--

673
00:36:04,933 --> 00:36:06,400
because you won't be allowed

674
00:36:06,435 --> 00:36:08,426
to endanger the village
a second time.

675
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,835
Now take off those robes!

676
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:16,709
Now, hold on.

677
00:36:16,745 --> 00:36:18,406
Sirah...

678
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:20,642
it's time you were
getting ready.

679
00:36:20,682 --> 00:36:23,116
The people will be assembling
soon to hear the story.

680
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:40,333
l want you to know, Commander

681
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,927
that l take
complete responsibility

682
00:36:42,037 --> 00:36:44,403
for what happened
in the Security Office.

683
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:46,669
l think that there's
more than enough blame

684
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:47,697
to spread around.

685
00:36:47,743 --> 00:36:49,677
Jake should have known better.

686
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:53,841
l'm afraid he and Nog
were just trying to impress me.

687
00:36:53,882 --> 00:36:56,112
That's not much of an excuse.

688
00:36:56,151 --> 00:36:58,847
Didn't you ever do
anything foolish

689
00:36:58,887 --> 00:37:00,320
to impress a girl?

690
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:01,686
l may have.

691
00:37:01,723 --> 00:37:03,987
Jake's a nice boy.

692
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:07,427
So is Nog... in his own way.

693
00:37:07,462 --> 00:37:10,158
l enjoy their company.

694
00:37:10,198 --> 00:37:12,393
l suppose you don't get
much of a chance

695
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:13,901
to be with people your age.

696
00:37:14,002 --> 00:37:17,130
True, but...

697
00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:20,699
that's not why l wanted
to be with them.

698
00:37:22,544 --> 00:37:24,808
l wanted to learn about you.

699
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:26,677
And?

700
00:37:26,715 --> 00:37:29,912
Jake speaks very highly of you.

701
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:31,508
He trusts you.

702
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:33,817
That's always nice to hear.

703
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:40,022
Hearing Jake speak of you...

704
00:37:40,062 --> 00:37:43,930
reminded me of how much
l miss my own parents.

705
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:47,394
My father was a great man.

706
00:37:47,436 --> 00:37:49,370
A great leader.

707
00:37:49,404 --> 00:37:51,497
l'm sure he'd be
very proud of you.

708
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,098
l try to be strong

709
00:37:53,141 --> 00:37:56,474
the way he was strong, but...

710
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,441
it's difficult.

711
00:38:00,482 --> 00:38:02,450
From what l've learned
of your father

712
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:04,158
he wasn't afraid to compromise.

713
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:06,851
That's because he knew
the Navot feared him.

714
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:10,761
lf l were to make concessions,
Woban would think l was weak.

715
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:12,789
l doubt he would be
that foolish

716
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,563
but he is determined
to get that land back.

717
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:19,039
l am not afraid
of Woban or the Navot.

718
00:38:19,073 --> 00:38:21,132
l never said you were.

719
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,973
So your answer is still no.

720
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:28,277
You don't lose by saying no.

721
00:38:28,315 --> 00:38:29,680
Maybe

722
00:38:29,717 --> 00:38:32,709
but a great leader
like your father

723
00:38:32,753 --> 00:38:36,280
is one who's willing
to risk saying yes.

724
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,267
Commander...

725
00:38:50,571 --> 00:38:52,562
l believe l know of...

726
00:38:52,606 --> 00:38:54,437
an opportunity...

727
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:58,104
that could allow both sides
to say yes.

728
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:11,953
Sirah, you'll save us.

729
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:14,187
l thought you wanted this job.

730
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,354
l do.

731
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:18,297
Then, why don't you
fight for it?

732
00:39:18,332 --> 00:39:20,061
No, Faren is right.

733
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,866
These people will never
accept me as Sirah.

734
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:25,871
Without their support

735
00:39:25,939 --> 00:39:28,874
l could never control
the Dal'Rok.

736
00:39:28,976 --> 00:39:31,274
You think l can?

737
00:39:31,312 --> 00:39:33,780
You have to.

738
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:35,509
Oh, Chief.

739
00:39:37,618 --> 00:39:38,880
Good luck.

740
00:39:54,735 --> 00:39:56,100
Tell us the story!

741
00:39:58,339 --> 00:39:59,328
Sirah, the story!

742
00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:07,844
Once upon a time...

743
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:10,543
there was a Dal'Rok

744
00:40:10,584 --> 00:40:14,850
and it lives there, in the woods

745
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:18,187
and he hated the village

746
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:21,160
and all of the villagers

747
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:25,689
and he wanted
to see them destroyed.

748
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:28,293
The Dal'Rok is here!

749
00:40:28,335 --> 00:40:32,704
Yes! The Dal'Rok is here

750
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,208
and it's hungry

751
00:40:35,242 --> 00:40:38,871
but the village
is prepared to fight

752
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,608
like it has always fought--

753
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,617
with the lights,
the shimmering lights.

754
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,848
Something's wrong.

755
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:51,949
What's wrong is that O'Brien
is not the Sirah--

756
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:53,083
you are.

757
00:40:53,127 --> 00:40:54,151
Come on, you can do it!

758
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:57,493
The village is strong

759
00:40:57,531 --> 00:41:01,331
and unafraid...
and... powerful

760
00:41:01,368 --> 00:41:04,895
and ready to face the Dal'Rok.

761
00:41:04,938 --> 00:41:08,237
Do you think that maybe
the Sirah planned all this?

762
00:41:08,275 --> 00:41:11,403
He knew the villagers
had lost confidence in you

763
00:41:11,445 --> 00:41:13,572
so he chose O'Brien
as his successor

764
00:41:13,614 --> 00:41:15,411
knowing that you would
have to rescue him.

765
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:16,473
Don't you see--

766
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:19,816
this is your chance
to prove once and for all

767
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,115
that you are the true Sirah.

768
00:41:21,155 --> 00:41:22,247
All right now...

769
00:41:22,289 --> 00:41:26,157
let's really focus
and send this one out, okay?

770
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:29,629
Let's really send
the Dal'Rok a message.

771
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:33,099
Where the hell are those lights?

772
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:50,282
Wait!

773
00:41:50,317 --> 00:41:52,547
There is no need to run!

774
00:41:52,586 --> 00:41:54,451
A new voice appears

775
00:41:54,488 --> 00:41:56,956
to challenge the Dal'Rok!

776
00:41:57,024 --> 00:41:58,184
lt's about time.

777
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:01,058
The Dal'Rok is a fearsome enemy.

778
00:42:01,094 --> 00:42:03,562
The mountains tremble
with its fury

779
00:42:03,597 --> 00:42:08,000
but our prosperity
is its misery

780
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:11,471
our unity is its vulnerability

781
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:14,997
and our strength is its doom.

782
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:19,479
Look-- the Dal'Rok trembles!

783
00:42:19,513 --> 00:42:23,040
lt fears our strength.

784
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,484
lt fears our determination.

785
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,548
lt knows
it cannot stand against us

786
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:34,356
because the village is united.

787
00:42:34,394 --> 00:42:36,021
We are as one.

788
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:50,939
You see for yourselves.

789
00:42:51,044 --> 00:42:54,070
The Dal'Rok is defeated.

790
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:57,140
This village is safe
for another year.

791
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,349
The Sirah! The Sirah!

792
00:43:01,388 --> 00:43:05,882
Let's get out of here
before they change their minds.

793
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,984
Sirah! Sirah!
Sirah!

794
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,994
Hail the Sirah.

795
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:21,633
Nervous?

796
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:24,007
Not at all.

797
00:43:24,044 --> 00:43:25,511
Maybe a little.

798
00:43:25,546 --> 00:43:28,106
Do you think Woban
will accept my proposal?

799
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:29,342
lt's very possible.

800
00:43:29,383 --> 00:43:31,851
lt would give the Navot
back their land.

801
00:43:31,885 --> 00:43:34,854
And free trade access
to both sides of the river

802
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:36,719
would mean a lot to my people.

803
00:43:36,757 --> 00:43:38,554
lt's a reasonable compromise.

804
00:43:41,228 --> 00:43:44,322
We thought we'd wish you luck
with your meeting.

805
00:43:44,364 --> 00:43:45,888
Thank you...

806
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,837
...for all your help.

807
00:43:58,979 --> 00:44:00,606
All right, let's go.

808
00:44:00,647 --> 00:44:03,878
You two are going
to clean the Security Office

809
00:44:03,984 --> 00:44:05,611
until it shines.

810
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,382
You know, Chief

811
00:44:08,422 --> 00:44:09,889
this is going to make
a fantastic story

812
00:44:09,957 --> 00:44:11,049
to tell around the station.

813
00:44:11,091 --> 00:44:12,854
Not for me.

814
00:44:12,893 --> 00:44:15,259
l've had my fill of storytelling
for the time being.

815
00:44:15,295 --> 00:44:17,286
Well, l hope you don't mind
if l mention it.

816
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:19,731
Suit yourself... Julian.

817
00:44:19,766 --> 00:44:22,132
Oh, and, Chief,
on second thought...

818
00:44:22,169 --> 00:44:25,161
you don't really have
to call me Julian.

819
00:44:26,807 --> 00:44:29,275
Right you are... sir.
