1
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:10,364
Come in.

2
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,099
Commander, l just received word

3
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,630
that a Valerian transport
has requested permission

4
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:19,643
to dock here at the station.

5
00:00:19,677 --> 00:00:21,008
Let me guess.

6
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:23,843
You're here to recommend
that we deny that request.

7
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,815
The Valerians ran
weapons-grade dolamide

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,478
to Cardassian forces
during the occupation of Bajor.

9
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,077
l'm aware of that.

10
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:31,986
l believe they're continuing

11
00:00:32,022 --> 00:00:34,252
to ship weapons
to the Cardassians--

12
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,589
weapons that could eventually
be used to attack Bajor.

13
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:38,925
l share your concern, Major,
but unless we have proof

14
00:00:38,963 --> 00:00:40,157
to back up those charges...

15
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:41,858
The proof is on that ship.

16
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,457
Let me conduct a search

17
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,833
and if l find any dolamide,
we can confiscate it.

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,064
l'm afraid it's not that simple.

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,571
Dolamide is used
for power generators

20
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:51,302
reactors and short-range
transports.

21
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,639
And for weapons.

22
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:54,974
Only if it's extremely pure.

23
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,776
So we're going to do nothing?

24
00:00:57,815 --> 00:00:59,043
l didn't say that.

25
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:02,484
We just can't board their ship
and start tearing it apart.

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,147
Well, what can we do?

27
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,685
You bring me evidence
that the Valerians

28
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:09,352
are dealing
in weapons-grade dolamide

29
00:01:09,393 --> 00:01:11,384
and l promise you
that the Federation will use

30
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,488
every kind of diplomatic
pressure to stop them.

31
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,123
You really think that'll work?

32
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:16,257
lt will if the Valerians

33
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,359
want to continue trading
with the Federation.

34
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,367
All right.

35
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:23,839
We'll try it your way.

36
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:25,136
Good.

37
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:26,506
Then you will see to it

38
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,172
that the Valerian ship
is cleared for docking.

39
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:35,243
Yes, sir.

40
00:01:35,286 --> 00:01:39,689
Chief, l have a subspace message
for you from your wife.

41
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:41,156
They've arrived safely on Bajor.

42
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:44,786
lmagine taking
1 1 bored school kids on a visit

43
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:47,127
to the grain-processing center
at Lasuma.

44
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:48,358
l'm glad it's not me.

45
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:50,893
Major.

46
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:53,028
Here's the information
you requested

47
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,163
on the Captain
of the Valerian ship.

48
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:57,174
Let me know
if you find anything else.

49
00:01:57,274 --> 00:02:00,300
Sensors are reading elevated
neutrino levels at the wormhole.

50
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:02,642
Something's coming through.

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,671
On screen.

52
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:11,985
Kira to Sisko.
You better come out here.

53
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:16,651
lt's the Klingon
Vessel <i>Toh'Kaht.</i>

54
00:02:16,694 --> 00:02:19,857
They weren't due back
for another month.

55
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:22,024
Open hailing frequencies.

56
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:28,695
l'm reading
a transporter signal.

57
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,207
Somebody must have beamed off
the ship just as it exploded.

58
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:36,406
Mr. O'Brien?

59
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,680
Something's interfering with
the rematerialization process.

60
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,381
Lock onto him
with our transporter signal.

61
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:46,048
Try boosting
the annular containment field.

62
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,455
l'm already there.

63
00:02:58,168 --> 00:02:59,635
He's been hit by weapons fire.

64
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,728
lt's severe.

65
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:02,671
We've got to get him
to cryostasis.

66
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:07,406
Victory.

67
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:14,977
He's dead.

68
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:22,609
Station Log, Stardate 46922.3.

69
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:25,049
We have identified
the dead Klingon.

70
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:28,418
His name was Hon'Tihl,
First Officer of the <i>Toh'Kaht.</i>

71
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:31,583
Why he died, and the cause
of the ship's destruction

72
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,593
is still unknown.

73
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:35,652
l found
tritanium alloy fragments

74
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:37,094
in his chest and upper arms.

75
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,098
lf that were all,
we could have saved him

76
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,100
but those weapon burns
were too severe.

77
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:43,728
ls there any way to identify
the kind of weapon used?

78
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,362
l'm running a microtissue
analysis right now.

79
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:47,100
l should have the results
in a couple of hours.

80
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:48,106
The Klingon said

81
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:49,540
''victory'' just before he died.

82
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:50,668
l wonder what he meant.

83
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,109
According
to Klingon High Command

84
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:54,579
the <i>Toh'Kaht</i> was
in the Gamma Quadrant

85
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:56,047
on a routine bio-survey mission.

86
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,551
''Victory'' during a bio-survey?

87
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:02,043
As l recall, the <i>Toh'Kaht</i> put in
for a maintenance check.

88
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:03,147
Ask around the station

89
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,522
and see what you can learn
about this bio-survey.

90
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:09,790
Dax and O'Brien, l'd like the
two of you to take a runabout

91
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,991
and try to find the <i>Toh'Kaht's</i>
mission recorder.

92
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:14,227
l want to know what caused
that ship to explode.

93
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:15,757
Aye, sir.

94
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:25,076
Lieutenant?

95
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:26,409
Yes?

96
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:27,743
You coming?

97
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:29,214
Yes.

98
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:30,546
l'm sorry.

99
00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:32,575
Never mind.

100
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:49,466
Damn it, not yet.

101
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,937
Deep Space 9, this is
Valerian Vessel <i>Sherval Das.</i>

102
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,239
We are entering
the Bajoran system.

103
00:06:57,277 --> 00:06:58,904
Clear us for docking.

104
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:00,344
Negative, <i>Sherval Das.</i>

105
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,712
There's going to be
a slight delay.

106
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:04,774
We are in need of maintenance.

107
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:06,513
lt's been a long journey.

108
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:09,989
Oh, l'm sure it has,
but we have our own problems.

109
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:12,491
You'll just have to wait.

110
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:15,586
Stand by, <i>Sherval Das.</i>

111
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,460
l'd like an explanation.

112
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:19,727
l wasn't finished running
a background check

113
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:21,063
on their ship.

114
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:22,796
We agreed there
would be no delays

115
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,064
in the docking procedure.

116
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:27,163
They just visited
Fahleena lll and Mariah lV--

117
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:28,674
the same two stops
they used to make

118
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,541
when they were running
dolamide to the Cardassians.

119
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:34,240
The last stop would be
the purification plant

120
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:35,578
at Ultima Thule.

121
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:37,082
Now, if l can place them there

122
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:41,780
then we know they're running
weapons-grade material.

123
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:44,790
Your ship has been
cleared for docking.

124
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:46,223
Thank you, Commander.

125
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,851
<i>Sherval Das</i> out.

126
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:51,358
No delays.

127
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,264
So, Quark

128
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:01,365
l heard you had some
problems with the Klingons

129
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:03,376
the last time they came through.

130
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,935
Spare me from beings
who think pain is pleasure.

131
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:12,745
ln small doses, perhaps,
but the Klingons

132
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:14,344
oh, they're hard
on the holosuites.

133
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:15,581
They wreck the furniture.

134
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:18,887
l'm still fixing
the walls of Holosuite 6.

135
00:08:18,925 --> 00:08:21,723
l'm not saying
they don't spend big.

136
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:24,457
l'm just saying, by the time
you figure in the damage

137
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:26,488
l'm lucky to break even.

138
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:29,866
They do tend toward bluster,
don't they?

139
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:32,497
Throwing their weight around,
bragging...

140
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,700
This crew was worse
than the last.

141
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:36,709
A glorious mission!

142
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:38,404
l said, ''What's so glorious

143
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:40,675
about a Gamma Quadrant
bio-survey?''

144
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:45,412
And, uh... what did they say?

145
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,560
Crafty tonight, Odo, aren't we?

146
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:58,120
Looking for clues about
the fate of the Klingons?

147
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:02,363
lf l tell you what l heard...

148
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:04,563
what do l get in return?

149
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:06,868
The chances are
what you heard won't help

150
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:09,238
so why should l give you
something for it?

151
00:09:09,276 --> 00:09:13,940
Because otherwise,
l heard nothing.

152
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,039
That damaged holosuite--

153
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,550
work crew seven
is probably doing the repairs.

154
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:20,917
Am l right?

155
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:23,286
Uh-huh.

156
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:26,656
Well, it looks as though
l might have to put in

157
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:28,991
a priority request
for work crew seven.

158
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:30,553
The bulkheads in security

159
00:09:30,597 --> 00:09:32,394
could use
a little shoring up.

160
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:38,331
They said...

161
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:41,397
they'd be coming back
through the wormhole

162
00:09:41,441 --> 00:09:43,966
with something

163
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,413
that would make the enemies
of the Klingon Empire tremble.

164
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:50,313
Their exact words?

165
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,375
Direct quote.

166
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:54,785
You've been most helpful.

167
00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:59,383
Don't let it get around.

168
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,930
Odo?

169
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:21,079
Dr. Bashir!
Dr. Bashir!

170
00:10:21,114 --> 00:10:22,547
Dr. Bashir!

171
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:48,977
Welcome back, Constable.

172
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:51,384
How am l?

173
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:53,446
How do you feel?

174
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,617
Fine.

175
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:58,218
Good, because l have
no way to know.

176
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:00,354
Your body chemistry
defies analysis.

177
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:13,802
l don't remember anything

178
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:17,006
but l'm back to normal?

179
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:18,809
Well, like l said, you tell me.

180
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:19,872
l don't know what caused it

181
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,645
and l couldn't tell you
if it'll happen again.

182
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:25,085
ln fact, there's really
nothing more l can do here.

183
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:28,352
Then thank you
for your time, Doctor.

184
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:34,053
Tell me, Odo.

185
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:39,027
Do you share my concern
over this Valerian situation?

186
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:40,865
Concern?

187
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:42,838
l think you know what l mean.

188
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:44,499
Why don't you tell me.

189
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,975
Then you can be sure l know.

190
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,637
Just don't be surprised

191
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:51,476
if the uneasy alliance
on this station

192
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:54,108
starts to show a few cracks.

193
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:57,118
What uneasy alliance?

194
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,451
Commander Sisko and Kira.

195
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,586
Mark my words,
there's going to be trouble.

196
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:13,600
What exactly are you basing
all this on, Doctor?

197
00:12:16,873 --> 00:12:19,307
Very clever, Constable.

198
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:21,867
But you're probably right.

199
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:25,540
lt's a little too early
to commit oneself either way.

200
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:28,278
Are you finished with me?

201
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:30,047
Well, unless you'd like
to pour yourself

202
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:31,348
through my phoretic analyzer.

203
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:32,649
l'd love to see the results.

204
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:34,680
Another time, perhaps.

205
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:47,499
l've got them.

206
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:50,068
Who?

207
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:51,403
The Valerians.

208
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:54,933
Their ship was at the Ultima
Thule station one week ago.

209
00:12:54,978 --> 00:12:56,275
That confirms it.

210
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:57,779
They're definitely
running dolamide.

211
00:12:57,814 --> 00:12:59,076
So?

212
00:12:59,115 --> 00:13:00,776
So l've got an armed team

213
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:02,808
ready to board their vessel.

214
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:04,479
Confiscate the material

215
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,148
and send them back
where they came from.

216
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,159
Frankly, l'm half-tempted
to take them to Bajor

217
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:11,490
and press charges.

218
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:13,757
By whose authority?

219
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:19,332
You're not going to do
anything about this.

220
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:21,337
l'm not...

221
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:24,406
and neither are you.

222
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:31,812
That ship is acting
against Bajoran interests.

223
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:36,308
This station
is Bajoran property.

224
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:40,220
Commanded
by a Federation officer.

225
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:42,724
Commanded by me.

226
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:45,193
Are you challenging that, Major?

227
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:51,263
No, sir.

228
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:55,196
Good.

229
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:01,767
Short-range sensors
are picking up some debris.

230
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:04,279
Looks like duranium alloy.

231
00:14:04,314 --> 00:14:08,546
Probably pieces
of the Klingon secondary hull.

232
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:10,552
lt's possible
their mission recorder

233
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,144
is somewhere in the debris.

234
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:13,951
The magnetic field
from the duranium

235
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,958
could be masking it.

236
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:17,983
Let's get a little closer.

237
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:23,261
Major Kira's
become awfully aggressive

238
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:27,292
toward Commander Sisko lately
about station policy.

239
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:28,998
An honest difference of opinion.

240
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:32,806
What if it's more
than a difference of opinion?

241
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:36,403
What if Kira thinks the Bajorans
don't need us on DS9?

242
00:14:36,446 --> 00:14:38,073
lt is their station.

243
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:39,741
That would be suicidal.

244
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:42,683
Without a Federation presence,
Bajor would be vulnerable

245
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,414
again to the Cardassians.

246
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:45,421
Well, that doesn't mean

247
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:47,218
there aren't plenty
of misguided Bajorans

248
00:14:47,256 --> 00:14:48,587
who think they can go it alone.

249
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:57,561
You've become quite friendly
with Major Kira, haven't you?

250
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:00,091
Have l?

251
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:04,004
Well, yes, l suppose l have,
if you say so.

252
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,029
Well, l wouldn't get

253
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:07,201
too friendly with the natives,
if l were you.

254
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:09,404
Remember
where your loyalties lie.

255
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:10,935
Of course.

256
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,416
Benjamin and l have been close
for a long time.

257
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,781
Hand and glove.

258
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:18,514
l'm on his side--
no question about it.

259
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,522
That reminds me

260
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:21,989
-of the time we found...
-Good.

261
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:26,726
Anyone who's against Sisko
is against me.

262
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:33,899
l'm picking up a weak subspace
transponder signal.

263
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,597
lt's the mission recorder.

264
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,816
Constable.

265
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,818
Can l help you, Major?

266
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:52,821
Oh, you always manage
to help me, Odo.

267
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:57,258
ln fact, l think we work
pretty well together

268
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:58,453
you and l.

269
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:02,123
Yes, l suppose our relationship

270
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:04,861
has always been... cooperative.

271
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:06,869
Exactly.

272
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:10,361
And that's just
what l need right now--

273
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:12,397
your cooperation.

274
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:17,138
l'm convinced the Valerians
have dolamide on board

275
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,343
but the evidence is
still circumstantial.

276
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:23,352
l need solid proof.

277
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:27,049
l want you to slip

278
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,524
past their security systems

279
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,027
and into their cargo bay.

280
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:34,791
l heard that Commander Sisko
was adamant

281
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:37,766
about not interfering
with the Valerian ship.

282
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,392
Has he changed his mind?

283
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:40,732
Yes.

284
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,795
How odd.

285
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,809
Very well.

286
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:52,337
l'll keep the two of you
informed about my progress.

287
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:54,349
That won't be necessary.

288
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:56,248
Commander Sisko's very busy.

289
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:58,116
No sense in disturbing him.

290
00:17:05,962 --> 00:17:08,430
l can't fool you, Odo.

291
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:15,097
You wanted me to go
behind Sisko's back, didn't you?

292
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:19,769
Forget it.

293
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:21,800
Bad idea.

294
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:29,974
What if you had to choose sides?

295
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:35,815
Just remember
who your friends are.

296
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:52,266
Personal Log, Miles O'Brien.
Stardate 46923.1.

297
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:53,637
We've managed to retrieve

298
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,972
a portion of
the Klingon officer's journal.

299
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,501
Of course, Major Kira
heard about it immediately.

300
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:01,014
She must have spies everywhere.

301
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:03,482
l believe the Captain
has gone insane.

302
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:05,918
He executed
two more crew members...

303
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:11,225
...medical officer...
... my quarters...

304
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,022
...violence

305
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:15,722
is being created by those...

306
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,527
energy spheres we brought back
from Saltah'na.

307
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:22,024
Believing him
to be the Captain's spy

308
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,594
l slit...

309
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,004
l've seen enough.

310
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,166
There's more.

311
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,540
Klingons' mission
must have failed.

312
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:31,340
That failure caused
problems on board.

313
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:34,507
l couldn't care less
what happened to a Klingon ship.

314
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,347
Well, the Klingons
might want to know.

315
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:39,250
Dax and l have set up
a data interpolation

316
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:40,413
to fill in what's missing.

317
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,546
lt might take some time.

318
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:42,886
lf you have to.

319
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:45,893
The search itself
is often reward enough.

320
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:48,293
Benjamin, do you remember
that...

321
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:50,627
Fine.
Do whatever you have to do.

322
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,633
Don't bother me with it.

323
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,548
Ah...

324
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:09,209
Here we are.

325
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,548
A Modela aperitif.

326
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:14,020
lt's bright and sweet.

327
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:15,885
Much like yourself, Lieutenant.

328
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:18,016
l'll put it on your tab.

329
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,357
The bad flattery's on the house.

330
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:23,192
The two loveliest creatures
on DS9.

331
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,028
l must be living correctly
to be so...

332
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:27,864
so blessed.

333
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:29,995
What can l do for you, Major?

334
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:32,437
Get lost.

335
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:37,267
As you wish.

336
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:46,587
How are you, Lieutenant?

337
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:48,919
You know what they say--

338
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:52,255
put the shoe
on the right foot first

339
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:55,956
but put the left foot first
into the bathtub.

340
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:59,600
l understand.

341
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:03,593
But what l really meant was...

342
00:20:03,638 --> 00:20:05,936
are you happy?

343
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:09,602
That's not a question
l get asked very often.

344
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:11,612
Oh, but it should be.

345
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:12,943
ln my opinion

346
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,780
you are the most valuable
officer on this station.

347
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:18,284
May l?

348
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,980
Please.

349
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:27,461
Not bad.

350
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:29,087
For Quark.

351
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:30,994
lt is good.

352
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:37,627
l couldn't imagine running
this station without you.

353
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:41,164
Are you trying
to tell me something?

354
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:47,106
My disagreement with Sisko
over the Valerians is no secret.

355
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:50,810
Well, you know how he gets
once he's made a decision.

356
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:53,911
Yeah, it's like talking
to a stone.

357
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:57,515
l remember a time...
on Rochani lll

358
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:00,118
we were cornered
by a party of Kaleans

359
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:03,663
who were not very happy
to see us, but Benjamin...

360
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:06,496
Y-You told me
this story this morning.

361
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,331
Oh.

362
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:11,133
l suppose l did.

363
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:16,671
lf you were to talk
to Starfleet Command

364
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:19,271
tell them how displeased
the Bajorans are

365
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:21,611
with Sisko's handling of this.

366
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:24,345
l know they'll listen to you.

367
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:28,845
l was decorated
on my very first mission.

368
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:31,187
The Admiral was a Vulcan.

369
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:34,194
So during
the presentation ceremony...

370
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:36,196
Dax.

371
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,630
We have to keep
the Valerians here

372
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:42,534
until we can search the ship
and confiscate the dolamide.

373
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,800
You've got to convince
Starfleet.

374
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:48,900
lt's for the good of Bajor...
and the Federation.

375
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:53,107
l've been friends
with Benjamin Sisko

376
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:56,706
for... many years.

377
00:21:56,751 --> 00:22:00,778
ln many ways, he's like a son...

378
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,449
or a nephew.

379
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:06,790
Some kind of close relative,
anyway.

380
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,295
Jadzia, listen to me.

381
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:13,926
l'm getting rid of Sisko,
one way or the other.

382
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:18,462
Don't force me to get
rid of you as well.

383
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,384
Would you like to join us?

384
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:33,045
Let me go!

385
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:35,055
What did you hear?

386
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:36,454
Nothing.

387
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,923
Nothing at all.

388
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,687
Good.

389
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:05,582
ls this a Ferengi fashion
l'm not aware of?

390
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:10,454
Kira tried to tear my head off.

391
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,791
l want to file charges.

392
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:16,353
Tell me about it.

393
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:19,025
l heard her plotting.

394
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:23,162
Go on.

395
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:28,471
She tried to convince Dax
to take her side against Sisko.

396
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,506
And did Dax seem persuaded?

397
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:34,241
What difference does that make?

398
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,249
l was attacked!

399
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:37,910
Answer the question.

400
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:42,414
l... l couldn't tell.

401
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:44,447
She was on the fence.

402
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,858
Doesn't Kira's behavior seem
a little out of the ordinary?

403
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:52,297
And the others...

404
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,733
at the staff briefing,
Sisko was bored

405
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:58,568
as if he couldn't be bothered
about running the station.

406
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:00,574
And Bashir...

407
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:05,011
since when is he so concerned
about station politics?

408
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:08,315
Don't look at me that way.

409
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:09,873
l'm perfectly normal.

410
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:13,409
Yes, l suppose you are.

411
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:17,151
lt's time
l had a talk with Sisko.

412
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:18,783
Odo, wait!

413
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:21,056
Odo!

414
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:23,595
Wait, Odo!

415
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:25,622
Odo!

416
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,328
l want satisfaction!

417
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:34,367
We have...
battle for decks... 12.

418
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:38,742
...armory... in the hands...
Captain Tel'Peh

419
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,508
...my death.

420
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:42,879
But still, l... confident

421
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:45,715
...gain control of this ship.

422
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:47,983
l am weakened by my wounds.

423
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:49,319
Sisko?

424
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:51,620
...my enemies closing in.

425
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:55,527
Still... hide...

426
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:58,306
Come in.

427
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:02,432
First Officer's Journal, Day 26.

428
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:04,104
Where's Commander Sisko?

429
00:25:04,145 --> 00:25:07,842
ln his quarters
where he's safe.

430
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:12,444
Still... been able to hide
a thalmerite device

431
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:16,355
under... beam near
the reactor... deck 26.

432
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,722
Rather... taken prisoner

433
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:23,389
l will blow up this ship
and transport to safety.

434
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:28,130
Perhaps Medical Officer Kee'Bhor
was correct.

435
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:32,196
Our... began when we opened
those energy spheres.

436
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,472
All l know
is that Captain Tel'Peh

437
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:39,446
must die!

438
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,914
Journal closed.

439
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:43,712
Sounds like

440
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:46,049
there was a power struggle
on board.

441
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,146
Some sort of attempted takeover.

442
00:25:48,189 --> 00:25:49,816
Management by mutiny.

443
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:53,349
Standard operating procedure
on a Klingon vessel.

444
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:58,388
But awfully unusual for a
Federation-run space station.

445
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,729
Don't worry.

446
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:03,032
lf Major Kira tries anything,
we'll be ready.

447
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:08,106
When will the other log entries
be available?

448
00:26:08,142 --> 00:26:09,439
At the current rate

449
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:12,310
of processing, it'll take
at least seven more hours.

450
00:26:12,346 --> 00:26:14,507
But the computer's taking it
one entry at a time.

451
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:17,677
l'll set it up
so you can access it as it goes.

452
00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:19,242
Thank you, Chief.

453
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,720
Of course, Constable.

454
00:26:20,755 --> 00:26:22,382
Don't the Commander and l

455
00:26:22,423 --> 00:26:24,584
always try to make you happy?

456
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:48,415
What are you doing here?

457
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:50,440
Chief O'Brien's orders.

458
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:00,520
Come in.

459
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:08,194
Commander.

460
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:09,897
Hello, Constable.

461
00:27:09,937 --> 00:27:11,905
How are you today?

462
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:13,998
Concerned, sir.

463
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:16,099
On such a fine afternoon?

464
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:18,111
How inappropriate.

465
00:27:18,145 --> 00:27:23,549
Commander, l think
something might be wrong

466
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:25,882
with... some of us.

467
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,548
Ever since the Klingon ship
exploded

468
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:31,023
and their First Officer
beamed over

469
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:36,928
certain behaviors and attitudes
have been... abnormal.

470
00:27:41,902 --> 00:27:46,134
There appears to have been
a mutiny on the Klingon ship.

471
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:48,437
l wouldn't go so far as to say

472
00:27:48,476 --> 00:27:51,036
the same thing is
happening on DS9

473
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:57,517
but l... do find
some disturbing parallels.

474
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,179
lf something's bothering you,
Odo

475
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:02,519
tell it to Mr. O'Brien.

476
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,547
That's what he's there for.

477
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:10,754
What do you think?

478
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:19,098
What is it?

479
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,767
A clock.

480
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:27,570
Fascinating, isn't it?

481
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:48,798
lt's not nice
to keep a friend waiting.

482
00:28:48,836 --> 00:28:52,738
Did we have an appointment?

483
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:59,036
When have l ever had to stand
on ceremony with you, Odo?

484
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:05,579
l need your help.

485
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:10,987
l took care of the Valerians.

486
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:12,525
What do you mean?

487
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,425
l locked down
their docking clamps.

488
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:17,431
That ship isn't leaving
until l say it is.

489
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:21,526
O'Brien will need at least a day
to do anything about it.

490
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:23,366
By then, it won't matter.

491
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:27,834
You're going after Sisko.

492
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,810
And O'Brien.

493
00:29:30,845 --> 00:29:34,406
Either we get a more reasonable
Commander from Starfleet--

494
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:37,281
someone we can control--

495
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,548
or we go it alone.

496
00:29:39,587 --> 00:29:41,555
With me running this place

497
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:44,888
you will be able to do
what needs to be done.

498
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:47,894
lf you want to toss
Quark out on his ears

499
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:49,395
toss him out.

500
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,295
lf you want to proclaim
martial law

501
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,924
on the Promenade, proclaim it.

502
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,527
This station will be yours
to protect

503
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:57,560
with no interference.

504
00:29:57,605 --> 00:30:00,574
What's your plan?

505
00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:04,938
Oh, Odo...

506
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:08,710
l trust you more than
anyone on this station

507
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:11,616
because you can't be corrupted.

508
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,587
But this is a dangerous time.

509
00:30:15,623 --> 00:30:18,683
l can't take any chances,
even with you.

510
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:22,594
When the time comes

511
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,621
you'll know it.

512
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:30,396
l'll be counting on you.

513
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:41,212
Computer, open a channel
to Starfleet Headquarters.

514
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:44,649
Subspace communication
to Federation territories

515
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:46,482
is currently unavailable.

516
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,612
Why?

517
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:49,714
By authority of Major Kira.

518
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:51,554
Ah...

519
00:30:51,592 --> 00:30:55,187
Open a channel
to the Bajoran Council.

520
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:58,790
Communication to Bajor
is currently unavailable.

521
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,734
By authority of Chief O'Brien.

522
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:05,000
That is correct.

523
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,304
Computer, are you finished
reconstructing the journal

524
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:10,970
of the Klingon First Officer?

525
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:13,309
Data interpolation is complete.

526
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:15,372
On screen.

527
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,214
Computer, scan the journal

528
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:23,519
for mention of contact
with any alien race.

529
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:25,024
One entry found.

530
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:27,459
Play it.

531
00:31:27,495 --> 00:31:31,829
First Officer's Journal, Day 22.

532
00:31:31,866 --> 00:31:36,428
Exploration of the fifth planet
proved to be a waste of time.

533
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,837
This world is not worthy
of a Klingon colony.

534
00:31:39,874 --> 00:31:43,605
All we found were
a collection of energy spheres

535
00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:47,239
which possess some type
of telepathic archive.

536
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:50,682
The spheres described
an ancient power struggle

537
00:31:50,718 --> 00:31:53,881
that destroyed a race
called the Saltah'na.

538
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:57,357
We will forward our results
to our science division.

539
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:03,912
Kira's already locked down
the Valerian ship

540
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:05,080
and she's diverted

541
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:07,750
half the station's systems
to her control.

542
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:08,849
Since when?

543
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,291
An hour ago.

544
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:11,726
l've heard
some disturbing rumors

545
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,593
from our people
on the Promenade.

546
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,033
l think she's going to make
an attempt on your life.

547
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:24,333
l want you to arrest them--

548
00:32:24,374 --> 00:32:27,343
Kira and every Bajoran
officer on this station.

549
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:29,675
l want the name
of every sympathizer.

550
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:32,204
That's not a good idea, sir.

551
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:37,346
There's a lot more of them
than there are of us.

552
00:32:37,387 --> 00:32:40,754
lf we tip our hand,
it might work against us.

553
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:44,153
What can we do?

554
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:45,525
Leave the station.

555
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:47,359
Never! Get me a phaser!

556
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:48,864
l'll get rid of Kira!

557
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:50,298
Hear me out, sir.

558
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:53,861
We leave the station,
raise a Federation attack force

559
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:55,166
and return.

560
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:56,672
And, on that day

561
00:32:56,707 --> 00:33:00,199
we'll get rid
of all your enemies.

562
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:07,909
How do we proceed?

563
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:10,613
l'll need a few more hours
to free up the Valerian ship.

564
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:12,383
l've already talked
to their Captain.

565
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:15,186
He's more than happy to take us
back to Federation space.

566
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:18,854
Call me as soon as you're ready.

567
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,971
lt'll take effect
in two minutes.

568
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:31,497
Plenty of time to get a good...

569
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:39,474
Plenty of time for you
to get a good night's sleep.

570
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:40,710
Thank you, Doctor.

571
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,447
Chronic insomnia.

572
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:47,116
l think it's hormonal.

573
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:48,784
So, how are you?

574
00:33:48,825 --> 00:33:52,022
l take it you've completed
your autopsy of the Klingon.

575
00:33:52,095 --> 00:33:53,289
Of course.

576
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,695
You know, Odo

577
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:57,029
events have been moving
rather rapidly

578
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:58,329
since our last conversation.

579
00:33:58,368 --> 00:34:00,529
l'd advise you
to choose sides now

580
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,335
or risk finding yourself
without any friends at all.

581
00:34:03,373 --> 00:34:05,637
The Klingon, Doctor--
what did you find?

582
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,144
He's still dead,
if that's what you mean.

583
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:10,373
l don't have time for jokes.

584
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:16,546
Your findings could determine
who controls this station.

585
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,588
How?

586
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:21,488
All in good time.

587
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:25,359
First, tell me
about the Klingon.

588
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:30,856
Well, l found
nothing very unusual.

589
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:33,495
The columnar cells
in his brain stem, perhaps.

590
00:34:33,537 --> 00:34:35,869
The membrane permeability
was off.

591
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:36,964
What could cause that?

592
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:37,996
Any number of things.

593
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:40,633
Could it have something
to do with telepathy?

594
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:43,145
The Klingons were studying
the telepathic archives

595
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,545
of an ancient race.

596
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:46,014
lf those archives were contained

597
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,551
in a self-sustaining
energy matrix

598
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:52,419
that could explain the changes
in the Klingon's brain.

599
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:55,482
Could that energy matrix
have somehow caused them

600
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:59,222
to reenact the power struggle
that destroyed the Saltah'nans?

601
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:00,889
Possibly.

602
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,762
What are you getting at?

603
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:07,099
Doctor, l believe the Klingon
brought the matrix with him

604
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:09,605
and everyone in Ops
was affected except me.

605
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,234
Without a humanoid brain,
my system rejected it.

606
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:15,711
An interesting theory,
Constable

607
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:19,876
but l'm certainly not behaving
out of the ordinary.

608
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:22,976
Of course not

609
00:35:23,053 --> 00:35:25,351
but what if you and l

610
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:28,415
are the only two
who aren't affected?

611
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,983
Do you think we could use this
to our advantage?

612
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:33,359
Exactly.

613
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:34,864
Tell me your plan.

614
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:36,991
The first thing we have to do
is figure out

615
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,660
how to remove the field
from everyone affected.

616
00:35:39,703 --> 00:35:41,432
Then we'd lose our advantage.

617
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:44,304
Would you prefer that someone
blew up the station?

618
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:45,638
l see your point.

619
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,645
The power to control
the energy matrix

620
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,580
is the power
to control this station.

621
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:54,175
lf l could determine the natural
resonance frequencies

622
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:55,377
of this telepathic field

623
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,785
l might be able to generate
an interference signal

624
00:35:57,821 --> 00:35:59,015
which could drive it out.

625
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:00,317
Do it.

626
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:04,088
l promise, Doctor,
you won't regret it.

627
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:13,397
O'Brien, what's taking so long?

628
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,529
Almost there, sir.

629
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:15,629
We've got one more level

630
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,333
of security lockouts
to break through

631
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:19,308
and the Valerian ship
will be ready to go.

632
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:21,810
Commander, l have
the report you asked for

633
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:23,369
on those weapon scanners.

634
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:24,971
Give it to Mr. O'Brien.

635
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:28,916
l really think
you should see this, sir.

636
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:29,680
Commander!

637
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:35,924
Dax to Kira.

638
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:41,996
ls it Kira?

639
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,589
Did Kira put you up to this?

640
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,464
No.

641
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:02,751
l want the truth!

642
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:04,777
ls that clear?!

643
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:12,422
Let's see how this works.

644
00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:17,662
Put it down...

645
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:19,362
sir.

646
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:31,578
Take them.

647
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:57,161
Dax, you were supposed
to deactivate the transporter.

648
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:59,004
l forgot.

649
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:01,670
Damn it, Kira must have
set up a force field

650
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:03,440
to keep us from beaming
onto the Valerian ship.

651
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,674
The transporter
rerouted us here.

652
00:38:04,714 --> 00:38:06,944
We've got to get to that ship.

653
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,677
Odo's our only chance.

654
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:11,687
He might be able
to override the field.

655
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:13,689
You're sure we can trust him?

656
00:38:13,723 --> 00:38:15,953
l don't see
that we have any choice.

657
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:17,253
Sisko to Odo.

658
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:21,124
Odo here.

659
00:38:21,164 --> 00:38:22,461
Kira has moved against us.

660
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:23,727
She has Dax on her side.

661
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:25,962
We need your help, Constable.

662
00:38:26,002 --> 00:38:29,301
You've got to clear us a path
to the Valerian ship.

663
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:32,274
Take Crossover Bridge 1
to the cargo bay entrance

664
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,799
into Docking Port Four.

665
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:34,970
l'll keep it open for you.

666
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:37,070
Right. Sisko out.

667
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:40,781
Leave your combadge here.

668
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:45,354
Don't look so worried, Chief.

669
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:47,288
She hasn't beaten us yet.

670
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:49,315
Yes, sir.

671
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,328
They're still
in Airlock Corridor 6.

672
00:38:52,362 --> 00:38:54,489
What could they be doing in
there?

673
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:55,998
Maybe they've given up.

674
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:58,432
Sisko would rather die...

675
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:00,265
which is fine with me.

676
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:03,170
Oh...

677
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:05,936
they must have taken off
their combadges.

678
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:07,703
That's all right.

679
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:09,541
They won't get far.

680
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:11,945
Someone's taking out
our force fields.

681
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:18,447
Whoever it is knows how
to override the security codes.

682
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:25,361
Kira to Odo.

683
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:28,690
Go ahead, Major.

684
00:39:28,732 --> 00:39:31,326
Whose side are you on,
Constable?

685
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:32,665
Yours, of course.

686
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:34,602
Really?

687
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,731
Then why are you helping
Sisko escape?

688
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:38,900
On the contrary.

689
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:42,173
You'll find him trapped
in Cargo Bay 4.

690
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:44,703
Consider it my gift to you.

691
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:46,238
Oh, my apologies.

692
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,910
We'll see you there.

693
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:49,680
Kira out.

694
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:51,754
Well done.

695
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:54,416
You certainly fooled her,
didn't you, Constable?

696
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:56,925
We're running out of time,
Doctor.

697
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,393
l'm just about finished.

698
00:39:58,428 --> 00:40:00,953
l've set up an ionic
interference signal

699
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:03,329
in Cargo Bay 4,
calibrated to lock on

700
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:06,733
to the resonance frequencies
of the telepathic field

701
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,000
and drive it out
of all those affected.

702
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:11,005
And what will happen to it then?

703
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:12,574
Well, it'll remain suspended

704
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:15,009
as long as the interference
is in effect.

705
00:40:15,111 --> 00:40:16,339
That's all l need to know.

706
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:17,368
Let's go.

707
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:26,815
What's wrong?

708
00:40:26,856 --> 00:40:27,823
lt's been sealed.

709
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:29,017
l wouldn't do that, sir.

710
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,253
You might run into Kira.

711
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:34,511
She must have realized we
removed our combadges by now.

712
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:43,793
lt's completely locked down.

713
00:40:43,827 --> 00:40:46,455
Someone's activated
a level-5 security protocol.

714
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:49,988
There's only one other person
on this station besides yourself

715
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:51,726
has that kind of access.

716
00:40:51,768 --> 00:40:52,996
Odo!

717
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:54,899
Relax, Commander.

718
00:40:54,938 --> 00:40:58,101
He'll be here any minute.

719
00:40:58,141 --> 00:41:01,599
So, this is how it all ends.

720
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:04,010
For you.

721
00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:09,715
You know what disturbs me?

722
00:41:09,752 --> 00:41:12,448
The ingratitude.

723
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:19,088
l offered you my kindness,
my help, my leadership

724
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:22,689
and how do you repay me?

725
00:41:22,732 --> 00:41:24,700
With betrayal.

726
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:28,602
But you won't
get rid of me so easily.

727
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:32,074
You see, unlike you,
l understand history.

728
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:34,736
My name will blaze
across the stars

729
00:41:34,777 --> 00:41:37,712
long after your petty
treacheries have been forgotten.

730
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:40,443
But you won't be here to see it.

731
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:43,378
Major, wait!

732
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:44,681
Glad you two could make it.

733
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:46,882
Computer, execute Odo One.

734
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:12,204
Constable?

735
00:42:12,248 --> 00:42:15,581
Everybody grab hold
of something secure.

736
00:42:57,026 --> 00:42:59,722
Welcome back, everybody.

737
00:43:06,636 --> 00:43:11,664
Commander's Log,
Stardate 46924.5.

738
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:13,767
With nothing to contain it

739
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,438
the telepathic matrix
has dispersed in space.

740
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:18,447
Meanwhile, l'm happy to report

741
00:43:18,481 --> 00:43:21,211
everything and everyone
aboard DS9

742
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,842
has returned to normal.

743
00:43:32,962 --> 00:43:34,953
Did you really build that?

744
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:36,965
Apparently so.

745
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:38,523
Why?

746
00:43:38,568 --> 00:43:40,934
l have no idea.

747
00:43:41,971 --> 00:43:45,236
l know that none of us
was really responsible

748
00:43:45,274 --> 00:43:48,971
for our actions, but...

749
00:43:49,012 --> 00:43:51,480
l feel l owe you an apology.

750
00:43:51,514 --> 00:43:53,277
For attempted mutiny.

751
00:43:53,316 --> 00:43:55,307
Well...

752
00:43:55,351 --> 00:43:56,818
yes.

753
00:43:58,121 --> 00:44:00,988
l think we'll let it go...

754
00:44:01,024 --> 00:44:03,049
this time.
