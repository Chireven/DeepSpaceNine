1
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:09,167
l'm not what a lot of people
think.

2
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:11,499
l mean, if you're a dabo girl

3
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:14,004
you know, you get a reputation.

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,507
Miss Sarda, why don't you
tell me exactly what happened.

5
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,408
When did you start
to have trouble with Quark?

6
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:22,038
About five minutes
after l got off the ship.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,911
He immediately made
sexual advances?

8
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:26,179
He said it was part of the job.

9
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:27,845
And what did you say?

10
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:31,686
l told him l'd wear the costume
and entertain the gamblers

11
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:34,191
but to keep his Ferengi
knuckles to himself.

12
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:35,521
That didn't stop him?

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,824
No. He said again that
it was part of the job.

14
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:40,593
He showed me
my employment agreement.

15
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:43,328
See, there it is
in the Ferengi print--

16
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:46,496
page 21, subsection D,
paragraph 12.

17
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,436
You're telling me the contract
you signed requires you to...

18
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:53,740
l guess l should have
read it more carefully.

19
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:55,474
l'm not a legal expert,
Commander.

20
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,574
l'm not a legal expert either,
but l can assure you

21
00:00:58,617 --> 00:01:00,084
after l talk to Quark

22
00:01:00,118 --> 00:01:02,985
he won't hold you or anyone else
to this provision concerning...

23
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,251
Commander, sensors
are picking up

24
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,917
elevated neutrino readings.

25
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,324
Something's coming
through the wormhole.

26
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,828
Excuse me.

27
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,454
Thank you, Commander.

28
00:01:12,497 --> 00:01:14,795
Are any of the transports
due back?

29
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,630
Not according to our logs.

30
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:18,499
Put us on Yellow Alert.

31
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,173
lt doesn't match anything
in Starfleet files.

32
00:01:29,247 --> 00:01:31,010
l'm getting readings
of a massive energy flux.

33
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,018
lt could be damaged.

34
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,180
Sensors indicate a single
humanoid life-form on board.

35
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:38,586
Hail it.

36
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:40,420
Aye, sir.

37
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,485
Hail acknowledged.
Response coming in.

38
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:45,189
On screen.

39
00:01:45,263 --> 00:01:47,561
Welcome to the Alpha Quadrant.

40
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,294
l'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

41
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:51,302
of the United Federation
of Planets.

42
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:53,167
Alpha Quadrant?

43
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:56,197
You've passed through a wormhole
into a new part of the galaxy.

44
00:01:56,274 --> 00:01:58,139
l saw a small ship disappear.

45
00:01:58,176 --> 00:01:59,302
l followed it.

46
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:01,244
That was one
of our patrol vessels.

47
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:03,679
You've traveled
almost 90,000 light years.

48
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:05,376
What planet do you come from?

49
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,385
How long does it last,
this anomaly?

50
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,545
lt's stable.

51
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,885
You can return
whenever you want to.

52
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,890
ln the meantime,
you're welcome to dock here

53
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,324
and we'll try
to answer all your questions.

54
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,827
No. No time.

55
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:20,161
lnertial stress is overloading
his structural capacity.

56
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:22,166
Prepare to transport him
off his ship.

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,259
l will not abandon my vessel.

58
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:25,792
Sir, your ship
is in danger of...

59
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:27,361
l will not leave!

60
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:29,271
We can use a tractor beam
to tow him in.

61
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:30,774
The beam's graviton field

62
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:33,039
should shore up
the structural integrity.

63
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:34,045
Do it.

64
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,046
Cut your engines.

65
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,308
Why?

66
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:38,543
So l can save your ship, friend.

67
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,811
We'll bring you in

68
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:41,785
try to fix you up
as good as new.

69
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:47,824
Good.

70
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,292
Engaging tractor beam.

71
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,192
Steady, now.

72
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:53,527
You feel the graviton field

73
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:55,726
taking hold?

74
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:57,064
Yes.

75
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:59,093
You'll be fine now.

76
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,698
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

77
00:03:04,843 --> 00:03:06,071
l think we might want to skip

78
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:07,806
formal first-contact
procedures for now.

79
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:09,507
Agreed.

80
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:13,048
Why don't you meet him
by yourself

81
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:15,052
at the airlock, Mr. O'Brien?

82
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:18,146
He might find that
a little less intimidating.

83
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:19,314
Aye, sir.

84
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:22,326
And, if you can...

85
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,818
find out
what he's so nervous about.

86
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:27,354
Aye, sir.

87
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:00,145
O'Brien to Ops.

88
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,239
Go ahead, Chief.

89
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:03,806
Sure you didn't

90
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,750
beam this fellow out
when l wasn't looking?

91
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:07,083
Negative.

92
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,111
He's not in here.

93
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:14,560
Sensors say
he's still on board, Chief.

94
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,966
Friend... if you're in here

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,596
you've got nothing
to worry about from me.

96
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:26,629
Understand?

97
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:39,679
l'm just going to take
a look at your ship

98
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,517
see what the problem is, okay?

99
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:51,790
And just to let you know,
l'm an engineer.

100
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:56,997
l know a little bit about ships.

101
00:06:57,037 --> 00:07:00,768
Well, more than a little,
actually.

102
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:02,775
Though l'll tell you

103
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:06,074
l've never seen anything
close to this.

104
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,811
All right, then.

105
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,308
ls this some sort
of plasma injector?

106
00:07:13,353 --> 00:07:16,789
Okay, then...

107
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:22,056
then that must be an off-axis
field controller over there.

108
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:23,494
Uh-huh.

109
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,088
Uh-huh.

110
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:28,862
The coladrium flow
has been damaged.

111
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:32,099
You can't go sneaking up
on someone like that, friend.

112
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:34,036
lt's an Alpha Quadrant rule.

113
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:39,812
Can it be repaired?

114
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:41,905
Well, that all depends.

115
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:43,506
Depends?

116
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,987
On what exactly
a coladrium flow is.

117
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,488
On my world, it would be simple.

118
00:07:49,523 --> 00:07:51,957
With proper materials,
l could do it myself.

119
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:53,118
Hang on.

120
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:55,354
l didn't say we
couldn't figure it out.

121
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:58,023
You're just going to have
to teach me as we go.

122
00:07:58,064 --> 00:07:59,531
l'm sure that we can...

123
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,193
l have no time.

124
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:02,462
l know.

125
00:08:02,502 --> 00:08:04,595
Everyone's
in a hurry these days.

126
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:05,730
We'll have you on your way

127
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:07,501
as soon as it's
humanly possible.

128
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,567
That's me, by the way--
human species.

129
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,601
Name's O'Brien.

130
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:14,807
Oh Brien.

131
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:17,316
Miles O'Brien,
Chief of Operations.

132
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,817
How about you?

133
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:21,844
l am Tosk.

134
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:25,449
That's your name
or your species?

135
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,187
l am Tosk.

136
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,389
Oh.

137
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,898
Tosk it is.

138
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,924
Come on.

139
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:41,633
There's nothing to be
afraid of out there.

140
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:44,405
We've got to wait for your
reactor to cool down anyway

141
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:46,071
before we can
do anything else.

142
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:48,410
Come on.

143
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:55,913
l've got work to do.

144
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:15,398
So, what happened
to you, anyway?

145
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:16,409
Looks like you took

146
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:17,910
some sort of a shock
to your hull.

147
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:21,072
The passage through
the anomaly was very rough.

148
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:23,207
Yeah, sure.

149
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:25,513
The wormhole can
shake you up, all right.

150
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:37,691
Security sensor.

151
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:39,255
Screens for weapons.

152
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:41,324
lt's just picking up my phaser.

153
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:43,461
You're fine.

154
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:50,873
You wear a weapon.

155
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,878
Defensive purposes only.

156
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:54,971
lt may not seem hospitable

157
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:57,347
but when you go into an alien
ship for the first time

158
00:09:57,384 --> 00:10:00,012
you never know
what might be in there.

159
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:01,850
You may even find someone

160
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:03,685
who can make
himself invisible.

161
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:05,816
You know what l mean?

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,230
l understand.

163
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,234
A health center?

164
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:27,838
Yeah. That's Dr. Bashir.

165
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:30,782
He looks after
our medical problems.

166
00:10:33,153 --> 00:10:35,781
How many live here?

167
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:38,313
Well, 300, more or less.

168
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:40,758
What is its purpose?

169
00:10:40,794 --> 00:10:42,694
Purpose?

170
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,424
Defense?

171
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:45,931
Surveillance?

172
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:48,957
Well, sometimes,
when l walk along here

173
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:50,970
l feel like we're
the flea market

174
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:51,993
to the sector.

175
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,372
But l guess our real job

176
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:57,876
is to keep an eye
on the wormhole.

177
00:10:57,911 --> 00:11:01,642
There's traffic going in
and out all the time now.

178
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:03,444
Many ships dock here.

179
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:05,110
Five or six a week.

180
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:07,779
We sometimes
have a whole convoy

181
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:10,255
on its way
through the wormhole.

182
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,258
But you have the honor

183
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:15,261
of being the first visitor
from the other side.

184
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:18,753
Others will detect ships
from your quadrant, as l did

185
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,425
and follow them here.

186
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,934
We hope so.

187
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:23,936
Our mission as
Starfleet officers

188
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,097
is to seek out new life-forms

189
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,266
so we can learn
about each other.

190
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:31,072
Madam, l distinctly saw you

191
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:33,238
move your wager
to the green line

192
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,611
after the play was completed.

193
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:37,775
l will return your currency

194
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:41,275
but you will promptly
leave the establishment.

195
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:43,812
You are not welcome here.

196
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:51,586
Well, there are some things
to learn about us that can wait.

197
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:56,025
How about you?

198
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:59,630
You an explorer?
A scientist?

199
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,606
l am Tosk.

200
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:04,605
Right.

201
00:12:06,446 --> 00:12:08,437
Computer, lights.

202
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:15,680
Oh, l wasn't the decorator.

203
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:18,816
l wish to begin work
on my ship.

204
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:21,884
Yes, well, we'll start
as soon as we can.

205
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:24,920
Now, why don't
you get some rest?

206
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:28,092
l require only 17 minutes
of sleep per rotation.

207
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:29,761
17? No kidding?

208
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:32,772
lf l don't get a good
eight hours a night

209
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:34,603
l'm not the same man.

210
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:36,108
Are you hungry?

211
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:37,439
Hungry?

212
00:12:37,477 --> 00:12:39,945
You know, would you like to eat?

213
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:41,537
Take in sustenance.

214
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:43,310
Liquid nutrients are stored

215
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:45,613
in plasmic fibers
throughout my body.

216
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:47,119
Oh.

217
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:49,781
Well, this is the food
replicator over here

218
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:51,791
in case you change your mind.

219
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:55,577
We finally got it making
a pretty good bowl of oatmeal.

220
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,271
Just ask the computer
if you need anything else.

221
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:03,173
Oh Brien...

222
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:05,152
thank you.

223
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:08,553
As the Vulcans say,
we're here to serve.

224
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:28,670
Computer...

225
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,371
State request.

226
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:34,041
l wish to see a display
of this facility.

227
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:37,882
Specify exterior
or interior display.

228
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,080
lnterior.

229
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:43,420
lnterior display available
in 19 sections.

230
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,892
Specify requirements.

231
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:48,760
Show me where
the weapons are stored.

232
00:13:48,797 --> 00:13:53,496
Habitat ring, level five,
section three.

233
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,869
Access restricted to security
clearance 7 and above.

234
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:09,044
lt's hard to say, sir.

235
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:11,244
You hate to prejudge anyone.

236
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:13,379
What are you thinking, Chief?

237
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:14,547
You know the old saying--

238
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,750
''A man who's always
looking over his shoulder

239
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,520
is waiting for trouble
to find him.''

240
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,618
You think he's on the run?

241
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,219
l'll tell you this--
he wasn't telling

242
00:14:21,262 --> 00:14:24,197
the whole truth
about the damage to his ship.

243
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:26,757
lt sure wasn't caused
by the wormhole.

244
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,666
Somebody took a shot at him.

245
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:31,536
lt came in at a 45 degree angle
to the hull

246
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:33,768
sliced through
two propulsion systems.

247
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:37,209
l'll know more when l get
a better look at it.

248
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:40,874
Stay with him as much
as possible while he's here.

249
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:43,679
l'll tell Odo
to keep an eye on him, too.

250
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:44,707
Aye, sir.

251
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:53,087
No. The coladrium flows
through the arva nodes.

252
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:54,595
What are they?

253
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,995
Some kind of high energy
magnetic coils?

254
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:58,726
For fuel replenishment.

255
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,701
Fuel?
Oh, like a ramscoop.

256
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:02,032
Ramscoop?

257
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,163
Yeah, to capture stellar gasses

258
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:06,537
and convert them
into usable fuel.

259
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:10,032
Yes. The arva nodes convert
space matter into fuel.

260
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:12,511
Ah, gotcha.

261
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:14,538
Mm, piece of cake.

262
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:17,312
Piece of cake.
Ramscoop. Arva nodes.

263
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:20,549
''Piece of cake''-- it's
an old human expression.

264
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:22,954
lt means they'll be
easy to fix.

265
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:24,959
They will be easy to fix?

266
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:26,255
Sure. Yeah.

267
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:28,888
We'll just get my crew
to remove your arva nodes

268
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,694
then we'll take them over
to the replicator center

269
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:32,757
and make new ones.

270
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:35,592
Piece of cake.

271
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:40,797
How long?

272
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:42,901
Oh...

273
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:45,071
maybe a day or two.

274
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,617
We'll want to run some tests
after the replacement unit's in.

275
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:51,448
No. No time for that.

276
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:54,216
Hey, l let you
take that unit out

277
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:55,745
without proper testing

278
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,587
it breaks down, you blame me

279
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,092
next thing l know

280
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:02,927
my work has a bad reputation
in the Gamma Quadrant.

281
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:05,694
l would not blame you.

282
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:08,201
l was joking, Tosk.

283
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:11,262
l cannot tell... Oh Brien.

284
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:13,297
Sorry, it's in my nature.

285
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:16,504
And you're the most
natural straight man

286
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:18,136
l've met in ages.

287
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:20,875
Come on, while the fellas
are working here

288
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:23,475
l'll buy you a drink
and you can tell me

289
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:25,179
why you're in such a rush.

290
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:29,387
Dabo!

291
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:46,734
Nothing like this
exists on my world.

292
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:50,210
This is where we do
most of our R&R.

293
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:52,805
What is ''R&R''?

294
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:54,644
Rest and relaxation.

295
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:56,673
You know, down time.

296
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:58,913
When we're not working.

297
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:02,912
You sleep a full third
of your rotation.

298
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:07,758
You rest and relax
while you are awake.

299
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:11,788
Alpha Quadrant has
far too much down time.

300
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:15,335
My wife would laugh at that.

301
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,533
She's barely seen me
in the last three weeks.

302
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:22,703
We are very different

303
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:25,713
Tosk and Oh Brien.

304
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:27,339
l've noticed.

305
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,315
Hey, barkeep!

306
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:31,784
Don't call me ''barkeep.''

307
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,047
l'm not a barkeep.

308
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,554
l'm your host.

309
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,955
The proprietor.

310
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:38,458
A sympathetic ear
to the wretched souls

311
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:39,687
that pass through
these portals.

312
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:44,562
And a man who will exploit
any vice you may have.

313
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:47,397
Two synthales, barkeep.

314
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:48,663
l am sorry.

315
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:51,831
l have no vices
for you to exploit.

316
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:54,665
A challenge.

317
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:58,941
Tosk is our first guest
from the Gamma Quadrant, Quark.

318
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,811
l'd take him at his word.

319
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:04,944
Perhaps a short adventure
in a holosuite?

320
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:06,977
Holosuite?

321
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:12,186
A fantasy encounter with
danger, romance, thrills

322
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:14,956
created for
your personal entertainment

323
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:16,657
by the brothers Quark.

324
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:20,896
l have no use
for fantasy adventure.

325
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:25,031
l live the greatest adventure
one could ever desire.

326
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:30,907
Then l envy you, Mr. Tosk.

327
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:43,217
What are you talking
about, Tosk?

328
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:47,523
What is this adventure
you're on?

329
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:50,463
l cannot discuss it.

330
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:52,693
Oh, sure.

331
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,065
Of course.

332
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:03,944
Sounds like you've changed
your mind about him, Chief.

333
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:05,206
Not exactly.

334
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:08,272
l mean he's running from
something, that's for sure.

335
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:09,681
And he's in danger.

336
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:12,413
And he can't, or won't
talk about it.

337
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:15,013
People tell doctors things
they wouldn't tell anyone else.

338
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:16,351
lf you could get him to have

339
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:18,291
a routine medical
examination, maybe l...

340
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:21,318
The thing is, l kind
of like the guy.

341
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:23,330
l'm not even sure why.

342
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:25,832
ln a way, he's almost naive.

343
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:29,928
l guess anyone would be
in an alien environment

344
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:32,201
but l don't sense a threat
of criminal intent

345
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,832
or dishonesty about him.

346
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,035
l thought you said
he lied about

347
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:36,838
the damage to his ship.

348
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:39,005
He didn't exactly lie.

349
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:42,983
But he didn't exactly
tell the truth either.

350
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:45,178
He keeps the truth
pretty much to himself.

351
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:47,346
When do you think
his ship will be ready?

352
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:48,355
Tomorrow.

353
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:51,620
l don't see that we have
much of a choice.

354
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:52,956
We can't hold him.

355
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:55,986
lf he wants to tell
you the truth, fine.

356
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,191
lf not...

357
00:19:58,232 --> 00:20:02,309
wish him well
and send him on his way.

358
00:20:30,137 --> 00:20:32,935
Just what do you
think you're doing?

359
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:40,608
Computer, seal off
corridor 14-A, Habitat Level 5.

360
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:41,944
Seal confirmed.

361
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:44,849
Security to Habitat 514-A.

362
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:59,322
When you get tired
of bouncing

363
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:01,334
off force fields,
we can talk, all right?

364
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:04,761
l did nothing to you.

365
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,535
lt's that security junction
l'm curious about.

366
00:21:07,574 --> 00:21:10,099
l must prepare.

367
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,735
For what?

368
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,746
l cannot discuss it.

369
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,008
l am Tosk.

370
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:18,107
l'm sure you are.

371
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,846
Why don't we go down
to my office

372
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:22,286
while your friend,
Chief O'Brien takes a look

373
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,722
to see just what you've
been doing in there?

374
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,020
Oh Brien?

375
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,220
Right.

376
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:31,753
l'm going to release
the force fields now.

377
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,393
l don't need a fight
from you, understand?

378
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:37,232
l will not fight you.

379
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,363
Good.

380
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:43,240
Computer, release
the security seals.

381
00:22:11,004 --> 00:22:12,904
l cannot discuss it.

382
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,770
And l can't accept
that as an answer.

383
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:16,503
l did nothing to you.

384
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,773
You were tampering
with the security grid.

385
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:20,006
l consider that a threat.

386
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:22,674
l think he was trying
to shut out the lock-outs

387
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,683
to section three.

388
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,843
The weapons locker.

389
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,115
What were you going
to do with the weapons?

390
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:29,144
Are you wanted by authorities

391
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:30,816
somewhere
in the Gamma Quadrant?

392
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:33,121
''Wanted?''

393
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:34,990
Have you committed crimes?

394
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,028
Never. l am Tosk.

395
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:40,999
What does that mean?

396
00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:43,195
ls that supposed
to explain all this?

397
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,397
lt is all l can say.

398
00:22:45,438 --> 00:22:48,532
Tosk, don't you think
we deserve some answers?

399
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,873
What should l do with him?

400
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,640
Hold him for now.

401
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:53,805
We'll wait to see

402
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:55,576
if someone shows up
looking for him.

403
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:10,656
Enough of this craziness, Tosk.

404
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:13,222
Tell me, what were you doing?

405
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:17,965
Oh Brien...
you must let me out.

406
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:19,972
Tell me.

407
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:22,907
Allow me to die with honor.

408
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,672
Die?

409
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:28,010
Who would want to kill you,
Tosk?

410
00:23:33,386 --> 00:23:37,083
Allow me to die with honor.

411
00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:45,190
He's climbing the walls
like a trapped animal.

412
00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:49,361
l'm sorry our jail cells
aren't to his liking.

413
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:51,802
Somehow, l feel responsible.

414
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:53,567
You do?

415
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:58,169
Yeah, well, l guess
l kind of adopted him.

416
00:23:58,211 --> 00:24:00,611
l talked him into coming
on board.

417
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,807
You didn't talk him

418
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:04,248
into breaking
into the security system.

419
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:06,479
l just feel sorry for him.

420
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,114
Somehow, l don't think
he means us any harm.

421
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:16,025
What the hell is his secret?

422
00:24:24,037 --> 00:24:27,666
Sensors are picking up
ionized L-band emissions.

423
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:29,834
The patterns match Tosk's ship.

424
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:33,107
Hail them. Maybe we'll
finally get a few answers.

425
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:35,114
No response.

426
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:37,378
Again, rotate frequencies.

427
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:41,011
lt's a modulated particle beam.

428
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:42,282
lt's scanning us.

429
00:24:42,322 --> 00:24:43,289
Ready shields.

430
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:44,347
Not yet, Major.

431
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:45,517
Let them have a good look at us.

432
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:47,856
l'm reading phased
power fluctuations.

433
00:24:47,894 --> 00:24:49,862
They may be readying
a transporter of some kind.

434
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:50,863
Now, Major.

435
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:51,864
Shields up.

436
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:53,024
Open all hailing channels.

437
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:54,158
Open.

438
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,328
This is Commander Benjamin Sisko
of the United...

439
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,462
They're bombarding us

440
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:00,473
with some kind of radiation
l've never seen before.

441
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:03,032
Very rapid magnetic
flux variations.

442
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:09,105
What the...?

443
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:11,413
They've reversed
the polarity of our shields.

444
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:13,544
l'm picking up
transporter locks.

445
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:14,917
They're beaming on board.

446
00:25:14,954 --> 00:25:15,921
Location?

447
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:17,889
Promenade.

448
00:25:17,924 --> 00:25:19,653
Security to the Promenade.

449
00:25:19,693 --> 00:25:21,320
Kira and O'Brien with me.

450
00:25:21,361 --> 00:25:23,056
Dax, you have Ops.

451
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,373
Ready phasers.

452
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:55,253
l'm Commander of this station.

453
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:57,126
Put down your weapons.

454
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,488
lncrease setting to level six.

455
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,220
lt's that Tosk they're after.

456
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:28,090
Maybe they have a right to him.

457
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,426
Nobody's abducting
a prisoner out of my brig

458
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,930
as long as l'm alive.

459
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:34,999
You may need this.

460
00:26:35,068 --> 00:26:36,000
Thanks, Major.

461
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:37,093
You know l never use them.

462
00:27:57,032 --> 00:27:58,522
l have Tosk...

463
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:00,535
...alive.

464
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:03,060
lt is over.

465
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:14,580
What a disappointment.

466
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:18,912
And after such
an entertaining beginning.

467
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:19,921
Entertaining?!

468
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,719
These aliens gave us
a great deal of resistance.

469
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:25,124
We wondered how you got
their cooperation

470
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,685
without violating
your oath of silence.

471
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,061
l told them nothing.

472
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,868
But to see you here...

473
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:35,733
caged...

474
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:37,898
helpless...

475
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,238
how could you allow this?

476
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:42,607
lt is a disgrace to all Tosk

477
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:45,614
and the most disappointing
hunt in memory.

478
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:48,549
You're saying that this
whole thing is a hunt

479
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:50,575
and Tosk is the prey?

480
00:28:54,189 --> 00:28:55,656
You are right.

481
00:28:55,691 --> 00:29:00,025
This Tosk is unworthy
of such a noble description.

482
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:05,567
For this dishonor,
you will endure

483
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:07,592
the greatest humiliation

484
00:29:07,636 --> 00:29:09,365
Tosk can know--

485
00:29:09,405 --> 00:29:13,774
to be captured
and brought home alive.

486
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:17,506
You will live out your existence
on public display

487
00:29:17,546 --> 00:29:19,104
where children
can make fun of you

488
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:21,912
toss you scraps of food

489
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,248
which is more than you deserve.

490
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:28,022
Release him.

491
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,753
You've disrupted
life on this station

492
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:33,261
for the pleasure
of your ''hunt''?

493
00:29:33,295 --> 00:29:35,889
l'm not inclined to take orders
from you.

494
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:37,398
Odo, watch the prisoner

495
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:40,869
while our guest and l
discuss this in private

496
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:43,201
unless you intend
to take him by force.

497
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:45,138
ln which case, l'm
prepared to give orders

498
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:46,732
to open fire on your ship.

499
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:48,106
Over this Tosk?!

500
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,078
Have you nothing similar
in your own society?

501
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,813
Centuries ago, people on my
world engaged in blood sports--

502
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:32,753
killing lower species
for pleasure.

503
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:34,187
A few cultures still do

504
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:37,192
but even they wouldn't consider
hunting a sentient being.

505
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:41,356
But he is sentient only because
we have made him sentient.

506
00:30:41,396 --> 00:30:44,365
He has been bred for the hunt.

507
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,527
His entire reason
to exist is the hunt--

508
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:52,302
to make it as exciting,
as interesting as he can.

509
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:54,468
Obviously, you
do not comprehend.

510
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,137
l comprehend just fine.

511
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:59,739
l have no tolerance
for the abuse of any life-form.

512
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:01,443
Abuse?

513
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:06,187
We honor Tosk.

514
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:08,712
They are the symbol of all

515
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:11,555
that is noble and courageous.

516
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:14,084
They train and condition
themselves

517
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:19,089
all their lives for this event.

518
00:31:19,134 --> 00:31:24,265
They're proud of their role
in our culture.

519
00:31:24,306 --> 00:31:28,936
l can't judge what is right
and wrong for your world

520
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:31,445
but on this station...

521
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,519
ln the future,
passage through the anomaly

522
00:31:37,553 --> 00:31:40,522
will be considered
out of bounds for the hunt.

523
00:31:40,556 --> 00:31:42,217
Will that satisfy you?

524
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:51,325
Now, you will arrange
for release of the Tosk.

525
00:31:59,408 --> 00:32:01,205
l've agreed to release him.

526
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:05,771
But, sir, Tosk is
an intelligent, living being.

527
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:06,940
lt's their custom, Chief.

528
00:32:06,982 --> 00:32:08,415
Under the Prime Directive

529
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,111
we have no right to interfere.

530
00:32:10,152 --> 00:32:13,644
What if Tosk were
to request asylum?

531
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:23,524
lf he asks for it.

532
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:35,899
All right,
l have a way out for you.

533
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:38,913
A way out...

534
00:32:38,947 --> 00:32:40,437
of here?

535
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:42,609
Request asylum.

536
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:44,642
Asylum.

537
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:47,814
You ask for the protection
of the Federation.

538
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:49,084
You understand?

539
00:32:49,124 --> 00:32:51,752
My Commander is willing
to protect you.

540
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:01,024
Oh Brien, l am Tosk.

541
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:03,697
l cannot hide here

542
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:07,038
behind the protection
of your Federation.

543
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:10,203
lt is against
everything l believe.

544
00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:11,542
You'd rather go back

545
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,878
and live in a cage
on public display?

546
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:18,046
To stay would be
a greater dishonor.

547
00:33:18,086 --> 00:33:20,680
l am Tosk

548
00:33:20,722 --> 00:33:23,088
the hunted.

549
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:29,257
l live to outwit the hunters
for another day

550
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:33,667
to survive
until l die with honor.

551
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,071
But that will not be my fate.

552
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,384
But l will not deny
my existence as Tosk.

553
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,552
Thank you, Oh Brien...

554
00:34:08,904 --> 00:34:12,897
but l cannot request asylum.

555
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,503
So far, l'm not impressed
with the tourist trade

556
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:35,702
from the Gamma Quadrant.

557
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:37,734
Not one of them has
bought a single drink.

558
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:38,904
Shut up, Quark.

559
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:42,408
More trouble
with the little woman.

560
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,678
What's that supposed to mean?

561
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:44,685
Nothing, nothing.

562
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,550
l just thought you
might want to talk.

563
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:48,782
There is nothing wrong
between my wife and l.

564
00:34:48,823 --> 00:34:50,791
And if there were,
l sure as hell

565
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:53,692
wouldn't want to talk
to some barkeep about it.

566
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:55,889
Sorry. My mistake.

567
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:00,798
What?!

568
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,802
Your face gets very...

569
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:08,536
pink when it gets aggravated.

570
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:10,441
Much more so
than most other humans.

571
00:35:10,478 --> 00:35:11,706
So stop aggravating me.

572
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:12,713
Oh, not me.

573
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:14,806
You came in the door this way.

574
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:16,282
Fine. You're right,
l'm aggravated.

575
00:35:16,317 --> 00:35:18,683
l am a keen observer
of behavior.

576
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,686
You want to talk about it?

577
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,687
No.

578
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:21,983
Why not?

579
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:24,583
Because it wouldn't do
any good talking to you.

580
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,818
Try me.

581
00:35:28,863 --> 00:35:30,262
Forget it.

582
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:33,323
lt's just the rules of the game.

583
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:34,664
Uh-huh.

584
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:38,502
Rules of the game.
Go on.

585
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:39,506
lt's a hunt.

586
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,905
Did you know that?

587
00:35:40,941 --> 00:35:43,501
They're chasing Tosk in a hunt

588
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:45,375
and everybody's
playing by the rules.

589
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:46,880
They're playing by their rules

590
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:47,903
we're playing by ours

591
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:49,472
and he's caught in the middle.

592
00:35:49,517 --> 00:35:50,484
'Course, l suppose

593
00:35:50,518 --> 00:35:52,008
if the Ferengi don't
like the rules

594
00:35:52,053 --> 00:35:53,020
they just change them.

595
00:35:53,054 --> 00:35:55,750
Well, rules, rules
are always subject to...

596
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,382
Of course.

597
00:36:00,294 --> 00:36:02,091
Change the rules.

598
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,667
Why didn't l think of that?

599
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:10,766
Thanks, barkeep.

600
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:21,004
So... what's bothering you
today?

601
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:32,486
Computer, access the power grid

602
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:35,859
to Security Checkpoint 4
on the Promenade.

603
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:40,832
That isn't necessary.

604
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:44,861
Our ritual requires it
when a Tosk is captured alive.

605
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:46,497
All right, let's go.

606
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,907
l'll escort the prisoner
to the transporter station.

607
00:36:49,944 --> 00:36:51,912
This is a security matter.

608
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:53,912
This is a Starfleet matter.

609
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:55,538
Orders from Sisko.

610
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,676
We'll see about that.

611
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,618
Do not trouble yourself.

612
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:02,383
My ship will transport us.

613
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:04,220
No, sir,
that won't be necessary.

614
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:06,317
Good relations
with other cultures

615
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,850
is our highest priority.

616
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:09,829
Commander Sisko
wants to make sure

617
00:37:09,864 --> 00:37:14,028
you understand we're sorry
we interfered with your hunt.

618
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:16,161
The least we can do is give you

619
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:18,865
an official escort
off the station.

620
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:23,000
lt's a token of goodwill
and respect in our society.

621
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:26,137
Very well.

622
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:33,616
Starfleet has no business

623
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:35,622
taking charge
of a prisoner transport.

624
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:37,851
Calm down, Constable,
what are you talking about?

625
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:39,860
l'm talking
about you ordering O'Brien

626
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:41,486
to escort Tosk off the station.

627
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:43,997
l didn't give him
any orders at all.

628
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:47,626
Sisko to O'Brien.

629
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:50,364
Mr. O'Brien,
report to Ops immediately.

630
00:37:50,404 --> 00:37:51,962
This way.

631
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:10,721
Glass jaw.

632
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:13,090
Now l know
why you wear a helmet.

633
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:14,594
Up here!

634
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:22,699
The hunt has resumed.

635
00:38:22,736 --> 00:38:24,033
Come on.

636
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:25,902
Your ship's ready.

637
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:47,889
Security reports a fight
in the Promenade. Here.

638
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:50,089
Apparently,
O'Brien set him loose.

639
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,827
l'm showing someone in an access
conduit above Quark's.

640
00:38:53,868 --> 00:38:57,395
Two life-forms.

641
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:59,372
One's human.

642
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:01,499
They're heading out
toward the docking ring.

643
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,533
l'll seal off
the adjoining corridors.

644
00:39:03,577 --> 00:39:04,669
They won't get far.

645
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:05,770
Constable...

646
00:39:07,748 --> 00:39:09,181
there's no hurry.

647
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:36,374
Here.

648
00:39:50,424 --> 00:39:52,949
Now you are Tosk
as well, Oh Brien.

649
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:01,801
The Cardies made these conduits

650
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:03,700
from two-meter thick
duranium composite.

651
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:05,261
l've never seen
a scanning device

652
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:06,466
that could penetrate it.

653
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:08,873
Ah!

654
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,342
Till now.

655
00:40:35,135 --> 00:40:36,466
Come on, Tosk.

656
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:38,562
Around this next corner
and we're there.

657
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:42,833
No, he is mine.

658
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,414
No!

659
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:01,843
Go on.

660
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:18,762
What now?

661
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:22,740
The hunt...

662
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:24,503
goes on.

663
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:29,006
You wish to come?

664
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:30,708
Oh, no, no.

665
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:32,238
l don't think so.

666
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:34,615
One day as a Tosk
is enough for me

667
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:36,051
and l've got a wife and kid

668
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:38,612
that wouldn't fit too well
into this lifestyle.

669
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:43,382
Will your Federation
punish you for helping me?

670
00:41:43,428 --> 00:41:46,761
Maybe. But if l know
my Commander...

671
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,767
Hell, those guys
wanted a hunt.

672
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:51,428
l just gave them one.

673
00:41:54,772 --> 00:41:56,603
Go on.

674
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:59,109
You better get out of here
while you still can.

675
00:41:59,143 --> 00:42:00,872
Oh Brien.

676
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:12,979
Die with honor...

677
00:42:13,024 --> 00:42:15,117
Oh Brien.

678
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:23,165
Die with honor, Tosk.

679
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:49,859
Just what did happen

680
00:42:49,894 --> 00:42:52,260
at that security
checkpoint, Chief?

681
00:42:52,296 --> 00:42:54,355
The weapons' sensors
must have overloaded

682
00:42:54,398 --> 00:42:55,888
on all his various gear, sir.

683
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:56,900
Must have?

684
00:42:56,934 --> 00:42:57,923
Yes, sir.

685
00:42:59,971 --> 00:43:04,169
''Must have,'' since
l increased their output

686
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,607
by about 200%.

687
00:43:05,643 --> 00:43:07,611
So in effect,
you assaulted him--

688
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:09,875
our first contact
with a new species.

689
00:43:09,947 --> 00:43:11,278
Yes, sir.

690
00:43:11,315 --> 00:43:13,215
We've got dozens
of top-level officials

691
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:14,513
back at Starfleet Command

692
00:43:14,552 --> 00:43:16,110
eagerly waiting to hear
about our encounter

693
00:43:16,154 --> 00:43:18,384
with the first new life-forms
to come through the wormhole.

694
00:43:18,422 --> 00:43:20,287
How do you suggest
l write up this report?

695
00:43:20,324 --> 00:43:23,760
Well, sir, l'm not
one to say, but...

696
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:25,888
well, you know

697
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,625
these hunters
weren't any happier

698
00:43:27,665 --> 00:43:29,758
than we were at having
to bring Tosk home.

699
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:32,235
lt seems to me,
in the interests

700
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,670
of mutual understanding
and future relations...

701
00:43:34,705 --> 00:43:35,899
Save it.

702
00:43:36,007 --> 00:43:37,998
You ignored your duty
to Starfleet.

703
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:40,738
You took off your combadge,
so you could ignore me.

704
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:43,576
You even ignored the Prime
Directive by interfering

705
00:43:43,614 --> 00:43:44,911
with their damned hunt.

706
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:46,007
Another stunt like this

707
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,711
and your wife won't have
to complain

708
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:49,310
about the conditions
here anymore.

709
00:43:49,353 --> 00:43:51,548
Do l make myself clear?

710
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:53,420
l understand.

711
00:43:58,963 --> 00:44:01,431
l was surprised
by one thing, sir.

712
00:44:01,465 --> 00:44:02,693
What's that?

713
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:04,826
Well, l knew l couldn't override

714
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:07,497
all the security seals
in the station

715
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:11,406
and l figured once you
and the Constable located us

716
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:13,603
well, it'd be over.

717
00:44:13,644 --> 00:44:15,236
We'd find ourselves

718
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:18,476
locked behind
some force field somewhere.

719
00:44:18,516 --> 00:44:21,644
l guess that one got by us.

720
00:44:24,255 --> 00:44:26,382
Yes, sir.

721
00:44:26,424 --> 00:44:28,289
Thank you, sir.

722
00:44:28,326 --> 00:44:29,588
Dismissed.
