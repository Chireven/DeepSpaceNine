1
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:18,944
Resistance is futile.

2
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:25,114
You will disarm your weapons
and escort us to Sector 001.

3
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:30,320
lf you attempt to intervene,
we will destroy you.

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,691
Red Alert.

5
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:34,697
Load all torpedo bays,
ready phasers.

6
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:36,995
Move us to position alpha,
Ensign.

7
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:50,235
They've locked on.

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,372
Reroute auxiliary power.

9
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,115
Our shields are being drained!

10
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,956
64 percent...

11
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:06,291
42...

12
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:08,524
Recalibrate shield nutation.

13
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:11,796
Modulation is having no effect.

14
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:13,427
Shields have failed!

15
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:14,436
Full reverse.

16
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:17,737
Maintain all...!

17
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:34,614
Damage report.

18
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:39,992
Damage report!

19
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,656
Warning. Damage to warp core.

20
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:44,997
Containment failure
in five minutes.

21
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:49,001
Direct hit...

22
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:50,970
decks one through four...

23
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:56,139
Let's get the civilians
to the escape pods, Lieutenant.

24
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:57,168
Aye, sir.

25
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:06,287
Leave everything.

26
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:08,119
Get to your assigned
evacuation area now!

27
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:09,454
Warning. Damage to warp core.

28
00:02:09,492 --> 00:02:11,084
Containment failure
in four minutes.

29
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:12,151
Dora!

30
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:14,959
l'll take care of her.
You go on.

31
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:16,295
Have you seen Jennifer?

32
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:32,943
Jennifer?!

33
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:34,176
Jake!

34
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:36,185
Warning. Damage to warp core.

35
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:38,779
Containment failure
in three minutes.

36
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:46,725
l'm going to get your mom.

37
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:48,628
You're going to be okay.

38
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:52,228
Jennifer!

39
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:53,565
Okay, Jake.

40
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:57,300
We'll get your mom out,
and we'll get out of here.

41
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:00,669
Commander!

42
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,200
Help me!

43
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:16,087
Jennifer... hold on.

44
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:19,318
Sir...

45
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:20,761
Just help me to get her free!

46
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:21,764
She's gone.

47
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:23,231
There's nothing we can do.

48
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:24,756
We have to leave!

49
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:28,767
Warning. Damage to warp core.

50
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:31,137
Containment failure
in two minutes.

51
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:32,607
Ensign, take the boy.

52
00:03:32,642 --> 00:03:33,631
Aye, sir.

53
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,776
We've got to go now, sir.

54
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:38,974
Damn it!

55
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:41,950
We just can't leave her here!

56
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:45,421
Oh! Oh, no!

57
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,635
Jake, Jake, you're okay.

58
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:08,569
Stand by to launch.

59
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:09,976
Ready.

60
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:39,526
Jake.

61
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,762
There you are.

62
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,270
How are they biting?

63
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:45,067
Small-fries.
Threw them back.

64
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:46,437
Want to go for a swim?

65
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:48,135
Don't have time.
We have to get ready.

66
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:50,701
lt won't be so bad.

67
00:04:50,745 --> 00:04:53,475
l've heard that Bajor
is a beautiful world.

68
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:55,345
So why can't we
live on the planet

69
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:57,351
instead of some
old space station?

70
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,683
The station is
in orbit of Bajor.

71
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:02,087
lt will be just like shore duty.

72
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:04,683
Will there be kids there?

73
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:06,023
Absolutely!

74
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,084
Lots of kids.

75
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:08,686
Bridge to Sisko.

76
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,890
Yes, Captain?

77
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:12,694
We're approaching
Deep Space 9, Commander.

78
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:14,759
We'll be docking
in seven minutes.

79
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:16,133
Acknowledged.

80
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:20,272
Come on.

81
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,744
What do you say?

82
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,112
We'll take the pond with us.

83
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:31,643
Computer, end program.

84
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,793
ls that it?

85
00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:58,226
Commence Station Log,
Deep Space 9

86
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:01,825
Commander Benjamin Sisko,
Stardate 46388.2.

87
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:04,598
At the request of the Bajoran
provisional government

88
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:06,366
Starfleet has agreed
to establish

89
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:08,340
a Federation presence
in this system

90
00:08:08,374 --> 00:08:09,671
following the withdrawal

91
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:12,007
of the Cardassian
occupational forces.

92
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:13,842
The first contingent of officers

93
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:16,415
including my Chief
of Operations, Miles O'Brien

94
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:19,009
arrived two days ago
on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

95
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:33,332
l'm told the Cardassians
decided to have some fun

96
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:34,492
the day they left.

97
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:38,630
Four Bajorans were killed
trying to protect their shops.

98
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:40,696
Why hasn't anybody
cleaned this up?

99
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,207
We've got
all available personnel

100
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:45,006
assigned to repairing
primary systems, sir.

101
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:48,013
The Cardassians took
every component of value.

102
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:50,015
We're virtually defenseless.

103
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:51,744
l discussed this
with Major Kira

104
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:54,309
the attaché assigned here by
the Bajoran government and...

105
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:56,288
Understood.

106
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:01,287
What about the civilians
who operated these shops?

107
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,158
A lot of them lost
everything they had.

108
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:04,823
A few are trying to rebuild

109
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:07,058
but most are
packing up to leave.

110
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:16,539
Welcome, Commander.

111
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:17,804
Please enter.

112
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:19,675
The Prophets await you.

113
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:23,645
Another time, perhaps.

114
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,448
Another time.

115
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,731
When my wife Keiko
saw our quarters

116
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:45,169
she started talking
about visiting her mother

117
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:46,194
in Kumomoto.

118
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,640
Sir, l wouldn't allow
the boy to go roaming.

119
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,735
We're still having
some security problems.

120
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:54,872
Dad, there is nothing
to sleep on in there

121
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:56,677
except for a cushion
on the floor.

122
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:58,581
Well, we can get
you a real bunk

123
00:09:58,618 --> 00:09:59,778
off the <i>Enterprise.</i>

124
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:01,480
l almost forgot.

125
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:04,046
Captain Picard wants to see you
as soon as possible.

126
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,489
He does?

127
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,790
Any word on our science
and medical officers yet?

128
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:10,887
They're expected tomorrow.

129
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:13,194
Jake, l want you to stay here

130
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:14,996
till l come back.

131
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:17,798
ls this the food replicator?

132
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:19,361
l'm afraid they're all off-line.

133
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:21,202
There's plenty
of emergency rations.

134
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:22,435
l could send some down.

135
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:24,375
Dad...

136
00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:31,613
We're going to have to rough it

137
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:34,882
until we get things
up and running, Jake, okay?

138
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:36,354
Okay.

139
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:39,790
''Okay.''

140
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:01,310
l'd like to ask the designer

141
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:03,815
what he was thinking about
when they built this place.

142
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,308
l still haven't been able
to find an ODN access.

143
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:09,583
That's the Prefect's
office up there.

144
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:13,023
So all others have
to look up with respect.

145
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:14,856
Cardassian architecture.

146
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:15,861
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:18,022
Major Kira's been using it.

148
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:22,330
ls it my imagination
or is it unusually warm?

149
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:26,134
The environmental controls
in Ops are stuck at 32 C.

150
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,764
We're working on it.

151
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:36,911
l guess it's time
to meet Major Kira.

152
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:40,510
Sir, have you ever served
with any Bajoran women?

153
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,020
No. Why?

154
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:44,182
l was just wondering, sir.

155
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:46,623
They've become meaningless.

156
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:49,093
l just don't agree, Kira.

157
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:51,255
You are throwing it all away.

158
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:52,764
All of you!

159
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,391
You're being a fool!

160
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:57,028
Well, then don't ask
my opinion next time.

161
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:00,329
Yes?

162
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:02,341
l'm Benjamin Sisko.

163
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,502
l suppose you want the office.

164
00:12:04,544 --> 00:12:07,206
Well, l thought
l'd say hello first

165
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:08,508
and then take the office

166
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:10,880
but we could do it
in any order you'd like.

167
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:13,777
Hello.

168
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,119
ls something bothering you,
Major?

169
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:18,748
You don't want to ask me that,
Commander.

170
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,780
Why not?

171
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:21,817
Because l have the bad habit
of telling the truth

172
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:24,421
even when people
don't want to hear it.

173
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:26,796
Perhaps l want to hear it.

174
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:33,028
l don't believe the Federation
has any business being here.

175
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:34,903
The provisional government
disagrees with you.

176
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:38,501
The provisional government and l
don't agree on a lot of things

177
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:40,409
which is probably
why they sent me

178
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:41,936
to this godforsaken place.

179
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,919
l have been fighting
for Bajoran independence

180
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:49,786
since l was old enough
to pick up a phaser.

181
00:12:49,822 --> 00:12:51,881
We finally drive
the Cardassians out

182
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:53,482
and what do our new leaders do?

183
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:56,552
They call up the Federation
and invite them right in!

184
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:58,496
The Federation
is only here to help...

185
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:00,226
...Help us.
Yes, l know.

186
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:04,532
The Cardassians said
the same thing 60 years ago.

187
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,060
Major, when l was ordered here

188
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:08,630
l requested a Bajoran national
as my First Officer.

189
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,107
lt made sense.

190
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:12,168
lt still does, at least to me.

191
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:15,612
Now, you and l are going to have
to find some way to...

192
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:20,285
Yes, Major?

193
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:23,083
Odo, are you reading something
at A-14?

194
00:13:23,122 --> 00:13:25,181
My security array
has been down for two hours.

195
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:26,623
l'll meet you there.

196
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:31,194
We've been having
a lot of break-ins lately.

197
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,960
No need for you
to come along, Commander.

198
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:43,665
Hurry up!

199
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,642
Now!

200
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:51,643
Now!

201
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:05,987
All right!
Just stand where you are!

202
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:10,432
Hold it!

203
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:29,883
That's enough!

204
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:31,514
Who the hell are you?

205
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:34,424
Odo, this is our new
Starfleet Commander.

206
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:43,492
l don't allow weapons
on the Promenade.

207
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:45,003
That includes phasers.

208
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,197
Nog?

209
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,729
What's going on?

210
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:53,576
The boy's in a lot of trouble.

211
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:57,913
Commander, my name is Quark.

212
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,943
l used to run the local
gambling establishment.

213
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:05,549
This is my brother's boy.

214
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:10,191
Surely, you can see
he has only...

215
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:12,254
a peripheral involvement
in all this.

216
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:14,664
We're scheduled
to depart tomorrow.

217
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:18,835
lf we could be permitted
to take him

218
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:20,395
l promise you,
he will be severely...

219
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:22,031
That won't be possible.

220
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:23,974
Take him to the brig.

221
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:33,985
Quark probably
sent the two of them here

222
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,887
to steal the ore samples
in the first place.

223
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:39,550
Major, there's a
Ferengi legal tradition.

224
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:41,389
lt's called plea bargaining.

225
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:42,792
l might let the boy go

226
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:45,888
but l want something
in exchange from Mr. Quark--

227
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:47,592
something very important.

228
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,897
O'Brien to Commander Sisko.

229
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:51,095
Go ahead.

230
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:53,765
Sir, the <i>Enterprise</i>
hailed us again.

231
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:56,604
Captain Picard
is waiting to see you.

232
00:15:56,642 --> 00:15:58,269
Acknowledged.

233
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:00,142
This won't take long.

234
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:16,945
Come.

235
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:20,248
Commander, yes, please come in.

236
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:24,119
Welcome to Bajor.

237
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:26,488
lt's been a long time, Captain.

238
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,688
Have we met before?

239
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:33,130
Yes, sir.
We met in battle.

240
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:36,726
l was on the <i>Saratoga</i>
at Wolf 359.

241
00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:47,544
l assume
that you have been briefed

242
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,812
on the events leading
to the Cardassian withdrawal.

243
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:53,318
Yes, sir.

244
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:56,651
l understand they spent
the last half century

245
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:59,089
robbing the planet
of every valuable resource

246
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,387
before abandoning it.

247
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:02,087
They've left the Bajorans

248
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:05,256
without a means
of being self-sustaining.

249
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:07,960
The relief efforts
we've been coordinating

250
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,298
are barely adequate.

251
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:14,367
l...

252
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:17,968
l've come to know the Bajorans.

253
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:22,841
l'm... a strong proponent

254
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:24,711
for their entry
into the Federation.

255
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,342
ls it going to happen?

256
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:27,943
Not easily.

257
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:30,547
The ruling parties are
at each other's throats.

258
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:32,614
Factions that were united
against the Cardassians

259
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:33,784
have resumed old conflicts.

260
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:36,852
Sounds like they're not ready.

261
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:39,124
Your job is to do everything

262
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:41,463
short of violating
the Prime Directive

263
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,331
to make sure that they are.

264
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:51,233
l have been...

265
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:53,302
made aware by Starfleet

266
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:57,214
of your objections
to this assignment.

267
00:17:57,249 --> 00:18:00,150
l... l would have thought

268
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:03,713
that after three years spent
at the Utopia Planitia Yards

269
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:05,656
that you would be
ready for a change.

270
00:18:05,691 --> 00:18:06,783
l have a son

271
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,919
that l'm raising alone, Captain.

272
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:11,395
This is not
the ideal environment.

273
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,261
Unfortunately,
as Starfleet officers

274
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,426
we do not always have the luxury

275
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:17,834
to serve
in an ideal environment.

276
00:18:17,903 --> 00:18:19,063
l realize that, sir

277
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:21,335
and l'm investigating
the possibility

278
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:24,036
of returning to Earth
for civilian service.

279
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:28,113
Then perhaps Starfleet Command

280
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:31,844
should be considering
a replacement for you.

281
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:33,976
That's probably a good idea.

282
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,953
l'll look into it.

283
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:37,615
ln the meantime, however...

284
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:40,625
ln the meantime,
l will do the job

285
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:44,595
l've been ordered to do
to the best of my ability, sir.

286
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,001
Dismissed.

287
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:08,248
lt's really quite simple, Quark.

288
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:09,754
You're not going to leave.

289
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,723
Not going to leave?

290
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:14,624
But we're packed
and ready to go.

291
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,093
Unpack.

292
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:18,824
l don't understand, Commander.

293
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:21,025
Why would you want me to stay?

294
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,590
l'm curious myself.

295
00:19:22,635 --> 00:19:25,661
The man is a gambler
and a thief.

296
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:27,433
l'm not a thief.

297
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:28,963
You are a thief.

298
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:32,273
lf l am, you haven't
been able to prove it

299
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:33,608
for four years.

300
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:34,943
Please.

301
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,948
My officers,
the Bajoran engineers

302
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:38,313
all their families

303
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,285
depend on the shops
and services of this Promenade.

304
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,618
lf people like you abandon it

305
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:46,955
this is going to become
a ghost town.

306
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:49,961
We need someone
to step forward and say

307
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:52,964
''l'm staying.
l'm rebuilding.''

308
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:55,364
We need a community leader

309
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:58,632
and it's going to be...
you, Quark.

310
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:02,641
Community leader.

311
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:04,472
Seems reasonable.

312
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:08,139
You have all the character
references of a politician.

313
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,708
How could l possibly
operate my establishment

314
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:15,845
under Starfleet
rules of conduct?

315
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:18,152
This is still a Bajoran station.

316
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,488
We're just here to administrate.

317
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:22,153
You run honest games

318
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:25,027
you won't have any problems
from me.

319
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:28,659
Commander, l've made a career
out of knowing when to leave

320
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:30,999
and this Bajoran
provisional government

321
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:34,665
is far too provisional
for my taste

322
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:37,175
and when governments fall

323
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:41,703
people like me
are lined up and shot.

324
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:43,715
There is that risk...

325
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:49,646
but, then,
you are a gambler, Quark.

326
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:51,246
And a thief.

327
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,850
You know, Quark, that poor boy

328
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:56,020
is about to spend
the best years of his life

329
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:57,858
in a Bajoran prison.

330
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,801
l'm a father myself.

331
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:08,068
l know what your brother
must be going through.

332
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:10,803
The boy should be
with his family

333
00:21:10,843 --> 00:21:12,777
not in some cold jail cell.

334
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:14,870
Think about it.

335
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:17,178
lt's up to you.

336
00:21:22,588 --> 00:21:24,647
You know, at first

337
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:29,150
l didn't think
l was going to like him.

338
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:43,204
Major?

339
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,909
Everyone else is busy
repairing the primary systems.

340
00:21:49,982 --> 00:21:52,280
l suppose Starfleet officers

341
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:55,651
aren't used to getting
their hands dirty.

342
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,298
ln the refugee camps

343
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:12,861
we learned to do
whatever needed to be done.

344
00:22:12,938 --> 00:22:14,565
Didn't matter who you were.

345
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:22,136
l was just talking
with our good neighbor, Quark.

346
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:23,341
He's laying odds

347
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:25,976
that the government's
going to fall.

348
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:29,476
Quark knows a good bet
when he hears one.

349
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:32,490
This government
will be gone in a week

350
00:22:32,524 --> 00:22:34,151
and so will you.

351
00:22:34,193 --> 00:22:36,491
What happens to Bajor then?

352
00:22:36,528 --> 00:22:38,189
Civil war.

353
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,998
You think it's inevitable?

354
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:47,335
The only one who can prevent it
is Opaka.

355
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:49,341
Opaka?

356
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,002
Our spiritual leader.

357
00:22:51,043 --> 00:22:54,035
She's known as the Kai.

358
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:56,905
Our religion

359
00:22:56,982 --> 00:23:00,281
is the only thing that
holds my people together.

360
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,015
lf she would call
for unity, they'd listen.

361
00:23:03,055 --> 00:23:05,990
Leaders of all the factions
have tried to get to her

362
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:07,458
but she lives in seclusion

363
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:09,393
rarely sees anyone.

364
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:13,524
Commander...

365
00:23:13,565 --> 00:23:16,329
it is time.

366
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:16,919
l apologize for the condition
in which we greet you.

367
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,424
The Cardassians?

368
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,325
Your arrival has been
greatly anticipated.

369
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:29,333
Have you ever explored
your <i>pagh,</i> Commander?

370
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,269
<i>Pagh?</i>

371
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:35,105
A Bajoran draws courage
from his spiritual life.

372
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,702
Our life-force...

373
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,949
our <i>pagh...</i>

374
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:45,975
is replenished by the Prophets.

375
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,486
Breathe.

376
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:51,318
Kai Opaka,
if we could discuss...

377
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:52,825
Breathe!

378
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:00,256
lronic.

379
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:07,832
One who does not wish to be
among us is to be the Emissary.

380
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,276
Please, come with me.

381
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,926
You are correct that Bajor
is in great jeopardy

382
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:37,300
but it is the threat
to our spiritual life

383
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:38,827
that far outweighs any other.

384
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,499
Perhaps, but l am powerless
until...

385
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,769
Commander.

386
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:52,450
l cannot give you
what you deny yourself.

387
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,181
l'm sorry?

388
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:57,554
Look for solutions
from within, Commander.

389
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:59,923
Come with me.

390
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,091
What is it?

391
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:12,495
The Tear of the Prophet.

392
00:26:23,183 --> 00:26:25,481
What the hell?

393
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:30,381
Opaka?

394
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,390
Ah... ow!

395
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:40,930
Ah... ow!

396
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,161
Hey!

397
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:44,932
l'm sorry.
lt's just that this...

398
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,370
Jen?

399
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:47,737
Yes?

400
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,708
Jennifer?

401
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:50,937
l'm sorry.

402
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:54,140
Did we meet last night
at George's party?

403
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:56,046
George?

404
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:00,079
Jennifer...

405
00:27:02,255 --> 00:27:04,223
Wait a minute.

406
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:06,088
This is impossible.

407
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,026
Are you okay?

408
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:09,358
l know this place.

409
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:11,626
This is Gilgo Beach,
where we met.

410
00:27:11,665 --> 00:27:13,792
We met here before?

411
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:18,964
l was carrying
three lemonades...

412
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:21,405
The sand was burning my feet

413
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:25,901
and l stopped here... to...

414
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:27,243
Ow!

415
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:32,416
Do you realize
how incredible this is?

416
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:36,614
No, of course you don't.

417
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,225
Jennifer...

418
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,901
have a lemonade.

419
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:57,535
l'm afraid l don't accept drinks
from strange men on the beach.

420
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:14,059
So tell me the truth.

421
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:17,393
Have we really met before?

422
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,022
No.

423
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:24,237
Then how do you know my name?

424
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:26,239
l... uh...

425
00:28:26,273 --> 00:28:27,638
George told me

426
00:28:27,674 --> 00:28:29,904
at the party.

427
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:33,572
Are you going
to tell me your name?

428
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:35,240
Oh, Ben Sisko.

429
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:37,910
l just graduated
from Starfleet Academy.

430
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:40,579
l'm waiting
for my first posting.

431
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,248
Oh, a junior officer.

432
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,258
Yeah.

433
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:46,919
My mother warned me

434
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,258
to watch out
for junior officers.

435
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:52,595
Your mother is
going to adore me.

436
00:28:52,632 --> 00:28:55,601
You're awfully sure of yourself.

437
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:57,535
lt's not every day

438
00:28:57,571 --> 00:29:00,904
you meet the girl
you're going to marry.

439
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:06,201
Do you use this routine
a lot with women?

440
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:10,410
No, never before,
and never again.

441
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,885
Sure.

442
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,389
How about letting me

443
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:19,551
cook dinner for you tonight?

444
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:22,562
My father was a gourmet chef.

445
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:27,932
l will make for you
his famous aubergine stew.

446
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:29,799
l don't know.

447
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:32,565
You're supposed to say, ''Yes!''

448
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:35,939
l'll probably be sorry.

449
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:43,004
Jennifer...!

450
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:59,421
Nine Orbs, like this one,
have appeared in the skies

451
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,094
over the past 10,000 years.

452
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,433
The Cardassians
took the others.

453
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,099
You must find
the Celestial Temple

454
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,607
before they do.

455
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:10,200
The Celestial Temple?

456
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:13,940
Tradition says the Orbs
were sent by the Prophets

457
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,277
to teach us.

458
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,944
What we have learned
has shaped our theology.

459
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:24,617
The Cardassians will do anything
to decipher their powers.

460
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:28,116
lf they discover
the Celestial Temple

461
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,788
they could destroy it.

462
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:34,823
What makes you think
l can find your temple?

463
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:42,866
This will help you.

464
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:44,968
Kai Opaka...

465
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,376
l can't unite my people

466
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:48,904
till l know the Prophets
have been warned.

467
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:53,142
You will find the Temple--

468
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:56,644
not for Bajor,
not for the Federation

469
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,590
but for your own <i>pagh.</i>

470
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:00,889
lt is quite simply, Commander

471
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,361
the journey you have
always been destined to take.

472
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:26,515
What?

473
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:31,621
l was just thinking...

474
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,595
how much you look like your mom.

475
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,469
Kira to Sisko.

476
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:43,801
Go ahead.

477
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:46,102
Sorry to disturb you,
Commander

478
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:49,633
but there's something on the
Promenade you might want to see.

479
00:31:49,678 --> 00:31:51,009
On my way.

480
00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:29,684
Step up, step up.

481
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:32,619
Fortune's fates
are with you today, friends.

482
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:34,985
Dabo!

483
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:37,321
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

484
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:39,326
That's fine.

485
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,590
l'll be right back.

486
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:55,643
What will you have, Commander?

487
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:57,235
How's the local synthale?

488
00:32:57,278 --> 00:32:59,246
You won't like it.

489
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,976
l love the Bajorans.

490
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:05,042
Such a deeply spiritual culture

491
00:33:05,086 --> 00:33:08,078
but they make a dreadful ale.

492
00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:12,685
Never trust ale
from a god-fearing people

493
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:14,422
or a Starfleet Commander

494
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:17,829
that has one
of your relatives in jail.

495
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:22,600
Dabo!

496
00:33:24,906 --> 00:33:29,036
Station Log, Stardate 46390.1.

497
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:31,443
The <i>Enterprise</i> has been ordered
to the Lapolis system.

498
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,640
They're scheduled to depart
at 0500 hours

499
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:36,206
after off-loading
three runabout-class vessels.

500
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:38,776
Meanwhile, our medical
and science officers

501
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,948
are arriving,
and l'm looking forward

502
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,390
to a reunion
with a very old friend.

503
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:45,483
Commander, if you'd like me

504
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:47,017
to give them a tour
of the station...

505
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:48,460
You and Dr. Bashir go ahead.

506
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:49,690
l'm afraid l have to put

507
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:51,426
Lieutenant Dax
to work right away.

508
00:33:51,466 --> 00:33:53,366
Jadzia...

509
00:33:53,401 --> 00:33:54,834
uh...

510
00:33:54,936 --> 00:33:57,461
maybe we could...

511
00:33:57,505 --> 00:34:00,235
get together later for dinner...

512
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:03,642
or... or... or...
or a... or a drink?

513
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:05,441
l'd be delighted.

514
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:10,713
He's a little young
for you, isn't he?

515
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:12,720
He's 27. l'm 28.

516
00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:14,381
328, maybe.

517
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:17,721
Did you tell him about
that slug inside of you?

518
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:19,056
Yes, Benjamin.

519
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:20,560
He knows l'm a Trill.

520
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:22,062
He finds it fascinating.

521
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:24,394
He's never met
a joined species before.

522
00:34:24,432 --> 00:34:26,923
l wonder if he'd
been as fascinated

523
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:28,902
if you still looked
the way you did

524
00:34:28,937 --> 00:34:30,336
the last time l saw you.

525
00:34:30,371 --> 00:34:31,668
Perhaps not.

526
00:34:31,706 --> 00:34:33,003
Whew.

527
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:36,602
This is going to take
some getting used to.

528
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:37,941
Don't be ridiculous.

529
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:39,947
l'm still the same old Dax...

530
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:41,312
more or less.

531
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:47,083
l'm afraid we've had
some security problems.

532
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:50,454
Looks like looters
got in here.

533
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:52,789
Oh, this will be perfect.

534
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:54,818
Real...

535
00:34:54,863 --> 00:34:57,559
frontier medicine.

536
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,829
Frontier medicine?

537
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:04,304
Major, l had my choice
of any job in the fleet.

538
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:05,636
Did you?

539
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:07,732
l didn't want some cushy job

540
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:09,299
or a research grant.

541
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:10,641
l wanted this--

542
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:13,044
the farthest reaches
of the galaxy.

543
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:15,777
One of the most remote
outposts available.

544
00:35:15,884 --> 00:35:18,250
This is where the adventure is.

545
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:20,652
This is where heroes are made.

546
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:25,591
Right here,
in the wilderness.

547
00:35:25,627 --> 00:35:29,393
This ''wilderness'' is my home.

548
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,920
Well, l-l-l didn't mean...

549
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:32,489
The Cardassians left behind

550
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,433
a lot of injured people,
Doctor.

551
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:35,766
You can make yourself useful

552
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:37,464
by bringing
your Federation medicine

553
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:38,631
to the natives.

554
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:42,165
Oh, you'll find them
a friendly, simple folk.

555
00:35:50,285 --> 00:35:52,185
We do have one advantage.

556
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,678
The monks have been studying
these things for 10,000 years.

557
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:57,088
l've had our computers set up

558
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,355
to interface with their
historical data banks.

559
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:01,225
That should give us something.

560
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:02,889
Soon as possible, Dax.

561
00:36:02,931 --> 00:36:05,126
The eight other Orbs

562
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,532
are probably in some
Cardassian laboratory

563
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:10,935
being turned upside down
and inside out.

564
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:14,434
Benjamin...

565
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:16,033
l was happy when l heard

566
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:17,772
you accepted this assignment.

567
00:36:17,812 --> 00:36:19,939
l'd been worried about you.

568
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:23,417
lt's good to see you, too...
old man.

569
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:29,989
Computer, create a data base

570
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:32,788
for all historical references
to the Orbs

571
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:34,124
including all reports

572
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,926
of any unexplained phenomena
in Bajoran space.

573
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:38,262
Time parameters?

574
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:40,267
Ten millennia.

575
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:41,666
lnitializing data base.

576
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:46,299
Requested function will require
two hours to complete.

577
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:10,894
Curzon.

578
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:40,244
The Captain's
in the ready room, Chief.

579
00:38:40,288 --> 00:38:43,257
Should l tell him you're here?

580
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:44,588
Oh, that's okay.

581
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:45,957
Thanks.

582
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,009
Transport me
to the Ops pad, Maggie.

583
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:03,374
Yes, sir.

584
00:39:07,282 --> 00:39:08,579
Mr. O'Brien?

585
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:11,984
l understand that l just
missed you on the Bridge.

586
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,453
Yes, sir.

587
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:18,482
l... l didn't want
to disturb you, sir.

588
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:20,221
Ensign.

589
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:25,226
This is your favorite
transporter room, isn't it?

590
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:28,725
Number three, yes, sir.

591
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,864
You know, yesterday
l called down here

592
00:39:31,907 --> 00:39:34,307
and l asked for you
without thinking.

593
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:39,176
lt won't be quite the same.

594
00:39:39,214 --> 00:39:42,672
lt's just
a transporter room, sir.

595
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:49,689
Permission to disembark,
Captain.

596
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:52,249
Permission granted.

597
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:01,398
Energize.

598
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,798
Message coming in
from their Commander

599
00:40:32,901 --> 00:40:34,061
Gul Dukat.

600
00:40:34,102 --> 00:40:35,592
Dukat.

601
00:40:35,637 --> 00:40:38,765
He used to be the Cardassian
Prefect of Bajor.

602
00:40:38,807 --> 00:40:42,743
He's requesting permission
to come aboard to greet us.

603
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:46,577
Surely a coincidence
that the <i>Enterprise</i> just left.

604
00:40:46,614 --> 00:40:48,707
Mr. O'Brien

605
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,345
tell Gul Dukat
l look forward to meeting him.

606
00:40:58,727 --> 00:41:00,354
Good day, Commander.

607
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:05,522
Gul Dukat.

608
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:08,331
Excuse my presumption

609
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:14,502
but... this was my office
only two weeks ago.

610
00:41:15,543 --> 00:41:20,412
l'm not used to being
on this side of the desk.

611
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:26,481
l'll be honest with you,
Commander.

612
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:29,615
l miss this office.

613
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:32,524
l was not happy to leave it.

614
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,289
Drop by any time

615
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:35,921
you're feeling homesick.

616
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:38,797
You are very gracious.

617
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,802
And allow me to assure
you that we only want

618
00:41:42,904 --> 00:41:46,806
to be helpful
in this difficult transition.

619
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:49,776
You're far
from the Federation fleet

620
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:52,541
alone in this remote outpost

621
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,447
with poor defense systems.

622
00:41:55,483 --> 00:41:58,816
Your Cardassian neighbors
will be quick to respond

623
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:01,549
to any problems you might have.

624
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:04,456
We'll try to keep the dog
off your lawn.

625
00:42:06,094 --> 00:42:12,556
So... tell me,
what did you think of Kai Opaka?

626
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,536
l know you went
to the surface to see her.

627
00:42:16,571 --> 00:42:19,768
l understand
you brought back an Orb.

628
00:42:19,874 --> 00:42:22,274
We thought we had all of them.

629
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,770
Perhaps we could have
an exchange of information--

630
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:28,974
pool our resources.

631
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:35,479
l don't know anything
about an Orb.

632
00:42:37,492 --> 00:42:39,892
We will be in close proximity

633
00:42:39,928 --> 00:42:42,795
should you wish
to reconsider my suggestion.

634
00:42:42,897 --> 00:42:44,364
ln the meantime

635
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:47,800
l assume you have no objection
to my men

636
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:50,497
enjoying the hospitality
of the Promenade.

637
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:56,734
Commander.

638
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:12,652
What do you know
about the Denorios Belt?

639
00:43:12,694 --> 00:43:14,559
Your basic charged
plasma field--

640
00:43:14,596 --> 00:43:17,565
no one gets anywhere near it
unless they have to.

641
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,568
ln the 22nd century,
a ship carrying Kai Taluno

642
00:43:20,602 --> 00:43:23,571
was disabled for several
days in the Denorios Belt

643
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:25,766
where he claims
he had a vision.

644
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:27,501
Let me guess.

645
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:30,170
He saw the Celestial Temple
of the Prophets.

646
00:43:30,211 --> 00:43:31,508
Not quite.

647
00:43:31,546 --> 00:43:34,174
But he did say
that the heavens opened up

648
00:43:34,215 --> 00:43:36,183
and nearly swallowed his ship.

649
00:43:36,217 --> 00:43:39,516
Are we reduced to chasing
metaphors to solve this?

650
00:43:39,554 --> 00:43:41,181
That's not all.

651
00:43:41,222 --> 00:43:45,181
At least five of the Orbs
were found in the Denorios Belt.

652
00:43:45,226 --> 00:43:49,458
There were also 23 navigational
reports over the years

653
00:43:49,497 --> 00:43:53,092
of unusually severe
neutrino disturbances

654
00:43:53,134 --> 00:43:54,999
in the same area.

655
00:43:55,036 --> 00:43:57,800
l've correlated
all these reports

656
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,932
into one analysis grid.

657
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:02,306
Our Celestial Temple?

658
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:04,743
Worth a look...

659
00:44:04,779 --> 00:44:08,943
but we've got Cardassians
on our back doorstep.

660
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:11,577
We need to get by them
undetected.

661
00:44:40,515 --> 00:44:42,779
May we have
your attention please.

662
00:44:42,884 --> 00:44:45,682
This establishment
is being closed.

663
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,688
What do you mean?

664
00:44:47,722 --> 00:44:49,622
You can't do this.

665
00:44:49,657 --> 00:44:51,625
lf you have a problem, sir

666
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:54,628
you'll have to take it up
with Commander Sisko.

667
00:44:54,662 --> 00:44:56,527
l intend to.

668
00:44:56,564 --> 00:44:58,862
This is outrageous.

669
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:03,828
Friends, my apologies.

670
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:10,876
A minor misunderstanding
that will be rectified shortly.

671
00:45:13,014 --> 00:45:16,506
Give them something
to put their winnings into.

672
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:45,743
Because we were winning
too much, of course.

673
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,181
Leave it to Starfleet
to ruin a fine day.

674
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:53,403
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Ops.

675
00:46:53,446 --> 00:46:55,539
lnitializing prelaunch systems.

676
00:46:55,581 --> 00:46:56,843
Confirmed, <i>Rio Grande.</i>

677
00:47:12,431 --> 00:47:15,093
Scanners are picking up
fluctuations

678
00:47:15,134 --> 00:47:18,501
in the Cardassian's
energy distribution net.

679
00:47:22,775 --> 00:47:25,107
Their computers are crashing.

680
00:47:25,144 --> 00:47:27,112
Shields and sensors are down.

681
00:47:27,146 --> 00:47:28,579
Odo's done it.

682
00:47:28,614 --> 00:47:30,241
Ops to <i>Rio Grande.</i>

683
00:47:30,283 --> 00:47:31,716
You're in business.

684
00:47:31,818 --> 00:47:33,683
Beginning launch sequence.

685
00:47:42,295 --> 00:47:44,263
Odo's reached
the transport site.

686
00:47:44,297 --> 00:47:45,855
Trying to lock on.

687
00:47:50,736 --> 00:47:54,536
l've never done this
with a Cardassian transporter.

688
00:47:56,242 --> 00:47:58,676
Damn it, what's the problem?

689
00:48:06,652 --> 00:48:08,449
Nice work, Constable.

690
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:27,098
Approaching grid perimeter.

691
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:29,699
Slowing
to one-quarter impulse.

692
00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:34,007
Computer, give me visual,
bearing 23 mark 217.

693
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:37,311
Range-- 3,100 kilometers.

694
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,615
Sensors are picking up
unusually high proton counts.

695
00:48:40,653 --> 00:48:43,383
Setting a new course
to those coordinates.

696
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:51,094
All external wave intensities
are increasing rapidly

697
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,428
but checking...

698
00:48:53,466 --> 00:48:56,128
Confirmed. There is no
corresponding increase

699
00:48:56,168 --> 00:48:57,465
inside the cabin.

700
00:48:57,503 --> 00:48:59,698
How is that possible?

701
00:49:06,879 --> 00:49:08,312
Sensors are not functioning.

702
00:49:08,347 --> 00:49:10,781
We've lost all contact
with the space station.

703
00:49:12,385 --> 00:49:15,149
Scanners are reading
major subspace disruption

704
00:49:15,187 --> 00:49:17,212
at their last known coordinates.

705
00:49:18,391 --> 00:49:21,189
What the hell is happening
out there?

706
00:49:21,227 --> 00:49:23,058
l don't know.

707
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,996
They're just gone.

708
00:49:32,305 --> 00:49:35,433
Are your navigational readings
going crazy?

709
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:37,169
l'll recalibrate
when l have a moment.

710
00:49:37,209 --> 00:49:39,074
Take your time.

711
00:49:46,452 --> 00:49:48,716
Can you get a fix
on our coordinates?

712
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:50,049
There is a star

713
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:52,614
just under
five light years away.

714
00:49:52,658 --> 00:49:54,489
No M-Class planets.

715
00:49:54,527 --> 00:49:57,291
Computer, identify
closest star system.

716
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,696
ldran-- a ternary system

717
00:49:59,732 --> 00:50:01,723
consisting
of twin O-type companions.

718
00:50:01,834 --> 00:50:03,392
ldran?
That can't be right.

719
00:50:03,436 --> 00:50:04,960
Computer,
basis of identification?

720
00:50:05,004 --> 00:50:07,734
ldran is based
on the analysis conducted

721
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,239
in the 22nd century

722
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:12,301
by the Quadros-1 probe
of the Gamma Quadrant.

723
00:50:12,345 --> 00:50:15,473
The Gamma Quadrant?!
70,000 light years from Bajor?

724
00:50:15,514 --> 00:50:18,005
l'd say we just found our way
into a wormhole.

725
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,984
lt's not like any wormhole
l've ever seen.

726
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:22,613
There were none
of the usual resonance waves.

727
00:50:22,655 --> 00:50:24,145
Could this be how the Orbs

728
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,522
found their way
into the Bajoran system?

729
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,585
Not an unreasonable hypothesis.

730
00:50:29,628 --> 00:50:30,754
lf it's true

731
00:50:30,796 --> 00:50:34,493
that would mean that this
has been here for 10,000 years.

732
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:36,433
Dax, we might
have just discovered

733
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:37,902
the first stable wormhole

734
00:50:37,937 --> 00:50:39,268
known to exist.

735
00:50:39,305 --> 00:50:41,569
Bring us about, Lieutenant.

736
00:50:49,448 --> 00:50:51,678
l'm modifying the flight
program to compensate

737
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:53,241
for the spatial
discontinuities.

738
00:50:53,285 --> 00:50:55,219
We should have
a smoother ride this time.

739
00:50:58,891 --> 00:51:01,121
Did you reduce impulse power?

740
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,718
No. Why?

741
00:51:02,828 --> 00:51:04,819
We're losing velocity.

742
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:13,004
Forward velocity
down to 80 kph.

743
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:15,439
Warning.
lmpulse system overload.

744
00:51:15,474 --> 00:51:17,738
Auto shutdown in 12 seconds.

745
00:51:17,843 --> 00:51:19,504
Disengaging engines.

746
00:51:19,545 --> 00:51:23,072
Velocity at 20 kph.

747
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:27,275
l'm picking up atmosphere.

748
00:51:28,621 --> 00:51:30,919
lnside a wormhole?

749
00:51:30,956 --> 00:51:33,618
Capable of supporting life.

750
00:51:37,797 --> 00:51:40,027
We've just landed.

751
00:51:40,066 --> 00:51:42,432
On what?

752
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:25,440
lt's beautiful.

753
00:52:26,445 --> 00:52:28,743
You have a strange
eye for beauty, Dax.

754
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:30,578
You don't think this is one

755
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:33,244
of the most idyllic settings
you've ever seen?

756
00:52:33,285 --> 00:52:35,549
We are standing on a rock face.

757
00:52:35,588 --> 00:52:38,751
Do you see the storms?

758
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:41,988
lt's as clear as a summer's day.

759
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:45,929
You see it, too?

760
00:52:45,965 --> 00:52:47,455
Yes.

761
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:01,947
Low-level ionic pattern.

762
00:53:01,981 --> 00:53:03,448
lt's probing us.

763
00:53:03,482 --> 00:53:06,815
Someone's idea
of shaking hands maybe.

764
00:53:16,562 --> 00:53:18,723
l am Commander Benjamin Sisko

765
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:21,459
of the United Federation
of Planets.

766
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:39,786
Dax!

767
00:54:29,114 --> 00:54:31,514
Another neutrino disruption.

768
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:33,847
Scanners are
picking up an object

769
00:54:33,885 --> 00:54:36,353
near their last
known coordinates.

770
00:54:36,388 --> 00:54:38,515
lt isn't a ship.

771
00:54:38,556 --> 00:54:41,024
Major, there's something
inside it--

772
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:43,027
some kind of life-form.

773
00:54:43,061 --> 00:54:45,928
Are the Cardassian
sensors picking it up?

774
00:54:45,964 --> 00:54:47,431
They should be
back on line by now.

775
00:54:47,465 --> 00:54:49,956
We have to assume they
know everything we know.

776
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:52,026
Yellow Alert.
Secure Ops.

777
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,197
Beam it aboard, Mr. O'Brien

778
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,208
but put it in a level-1
security field.

779
00:54:57,242 --> 00:55:00,040
Aye, sir.
Locking on.

780
00:55:25,403 --> 00:55:27,530
Who are you?

781
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:33,670
Who are you?!

782
00:55:33,712 --> 00:55:35,680
lt is corporeal!

783
00:55:35,714 --> 00:55:37,682
A physical entity.

784
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:39,512
What?

785
00:55:39,551 --> 00:55:41,542
What did you say?

786
00:55:41,586 --> 00:55:44,851
lt is responding
to visual and auditory stimuli.

787
00:55:44,889 --> 00:55:46,857
Linguistic communication.

788
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:49,359
Yes, linguistic communication.

789
00:55:49,394 --> 00:55:52,557
Are you capable
of communicating with me?

790
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,993
What... are you?

791
00:55:58,036 --> 00:56:00,869
My species is known as human.

792
00:56:00,905 --> 00:56:04,397
l come from a planet
called Earth.

793
00:56:04,442 --> 00:56:05,773
Earth?

794
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:09,541
This is what my planet
looks like.

795
00:56:09,581 --> 00:56:14,041
You and l
are very different species.

796
00:56:14,085 --> 00:56:17,054
lt will take... time

797
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:19,648
for us to understand
one another.

798
00:56:19,758 --> 00:56:25,025
What is this... time?

799
00:56:34,939 --> 00:56:39,171
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 46392.7.

800
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,144
We're preparing to launch
a rescue mission

801
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:42,806
to find Commander Sisko.

802
00:56:42,847 --> 00:56:45,577
But first, our navigational
sensors must be recalibrated

803
00:56:45,617 --> 00:56:48,814
to work under the conditions
reported by Lieutenant Dax.

804
00:56:48,853 --> 00:56:51,822
lt is no ordinary wormhole.

805
00:56:51,856 --> 00:56:54,017
My analysis suggests

806
00:56:54,058 --> 00:56:57,494
that it isn't
even a natural phenomenon.

807
00:56:57,529 --> 00:56:59,156
Not natural?

808
00:56:59,197 --> 00:57:01,324
You mean it was constructed?

809
00:57:01,366 --> 00:57:04,335
lt's very possible
whoever made the Orbs

810
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:06,496
also created this wormhole.

811
00:57:06,538 --> 00:57:09,336
The Cardassians
are leaving their position

812
00:57:09,374 --> 00:57:11,774
on a course toward
the Denorios Belt.

813
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:13,505
Mr. O'Brien

814
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:16,639
what would it take
to move this station

815
00:57:16,714 --> 00:57:19,012
to the mouth of the wormhole?

816
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:21,280
This isn't a starship, Major.

817
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:23,583
We've got six working thrusters
to power us and that's it.

818
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:26,317
160 million-kilometer
trip would take

819
00:57:26,357 --> 00:57:27,654
two months.

820
00:57:27,692 --> 00:57:29,182
lt has to be there tomorrow.

821
00:57:29,227 --> 00:57:31,058
That's not possible, sir.

822
00:57:31,095 --> 00:57:32,824
That wormhole
might just reshape

823
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:34,798
the future
of this entire quadrant.

824
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:37,233
The Bajorans have
to stake a claim to it

825
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:38,257
and l have to admit

826
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,134
that claim would be
a lot stronger

827
00:57:40,171 --> 00:57:43,538
if there's a Federation presence
to back it up.

828
00:57:43,575 --> 00:57:46,135
Couldn't you modify
the subspace field output

829
00:57:46,177 --> 00:57:48,077
of the deflector generators
just enough

830
00:57:48,112 --> 00:57:51,047
to create a low-level field
around the station?

831
00:57:51,082 --> 00:57:52,982
So we could lower
the inertial mass.

832
00:57:53,017 --> 00:57:55,986
lf you can make
the station lighter

833
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,682
those six thrusters
will be all the power we need.

834
00:57:58,723 --> 00:57:59,690
This whole station

835
00:57:59,757 --> 00:58:01,918
could break apart like
an egg if it doesn't work.

836
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,985
Even if it does work,
we're still going

837
00:58:04,028 --> 00:58:06,496
to need help from Starfleet
once we get there.

838
00:58:06,531 --> 00:58:08,522
The <i>Enterprise</i> is still
the nearest starship.

839
00:58:08,566 --> 00:58:09,999
They could reach us in two days.

840
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:12,264
We should advise Starfleet

841
00:58:12,303 --> 00:58:14,635
that we will require
their assistance.

842
00:58:14,706 --> 00:58:16,537
You have Ops, Mr. O'Brien.

843
00:58:16,574 --> 00:58:18,508
Lieutenant, you're with me.

844
00:58:18,543 --> 00:58:19,510
Aye, sir.

845
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:21,011
You too, Doc.

846
00:58:21,045 --> 00:58:23,172
Time to be a hero.

847
00:58:23,214 --> 00:58:24,875
Yes, sir!

848
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:39,363
Constable...

849
00:58:39,397 --> 00:58:41,024
This is a security matter.

850
00:58:41,065 --> 00:58:42,862
l'm in charge of security.

851
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:44,198
Security here, on the station.

852
00:58:44,235 --> 00:58:46,294
l cannot justify taking
you into this wormhole.

853
00:58:46,337 --> 00:58:48,498
We have no idea what we're
dealing with in there.

854
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:49,528
lt could be hostile...

855
00:58:49,574 --> 00:58:54,170
Major, l was found
in the Denorios Belt.

856
00:58:54,212 --> 00:58:56,476
l don't know where l came from--

857
00:58:56,514 --> 00:58:59,381
no idea if there are
any others like me.

858
00:58:59,417 --> 00:59:02,716
All my life, l've been forced
to pass myself off as one of you

859
00:59:02,754 --> 00:59:05,518
always wondering
who l really am.

860
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:09,059
Well, the answers
to a lot of my questions

861
00:59:09,093 --> 00:59:11,584
may be somewhere on
the other side of that wormhole.

862
00:59:16,968 --> 00:59:18,629
You coming?

863
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:39,493
The creature must be destroyed
before it destroys us.

864
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:41,025
lt is malevolent.

865
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,504
Aggressive.

866
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:45,097
Adversarial.

867
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,903
lt must be destroyed.

868
00:59:46,942 --> 00:59:48,409
l am not your enemy.

869
00:59:48,443 --> 00:59:50,809
l was sent here by the people
you contacted.

870
00:59:50,846 --> 00:59:52,074
Contacted?

871
00:59:52,114 --> 00:59:54,446
With your devices-- your Orbs.

872
00:59:54,483 --> 00:59:57,247
We seek contact
with other life-forms

873
00:59:57,286 --> 01:00:00,813
not corporeal creatures
who annihilate us.

874
01:00:00,856 --> 01:00:04,348
l have not come
to annihilate anyone.

875
01:00:04,393 --> 01:00:06,156
Destroy it now.

876
01:00:07,596 --> 01:00:12,124
My species respects life
above all else.

877
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:15,068
Can you say the same?

878
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:21,031
l do not understand the threat
that l bring to you

879
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:23,203
but l am not your enemy.

880
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:26,646
Allow me to prove it.

881
01:00:26,682 --> 01:00:27,979
Prove it?

882
01:00:28,016 --> 01:00:29,847
lt can be argued

883
01:00:29,885 --> 01:00:33,218
that a human is ultimately
the sum of his experiences.

884
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,847
Experiences...

885
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,517
what is this?

886
01:00:36,558 --> 01:00:38,116
Memories.

887
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,355
Events from my past

888
01:00:40,395 --> 01:00:42,295
like this one.

889
01:00:42,331 --> 01:00:43,798
Past?

890
01:00:43,832 --> 01:00:46,323
Things that happened before now.

891
01:00:48,337 --> 01:00:52,797
You have absolutely no idea
what l'm talking about.

892
01:00:52,841 --> 01:00:55,605
What comes before now
is no different

893
01:00:55,644 --> 01:00:59,910
than what is now,
or what is to come.

894
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:02,416
lt is one's existence.

895
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:08,321
Then, for you,
there is no linear time.

896
01:01:08,357 --> 01:01:11,326
Linear time-- what is this?

897
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,124
My species lives
in one point in time

898
01:01:14,162 --> 01:01:16,995
and once we move
beyond that point

899
01:01:17,032 --> 01:01:19,000
it becomes the past.

900
01:01:19,034 --> 01:01:22,003
The future, all that
is still to come

901
01:01:22,037 --> 01:01:24,164
does not exist yet for us.

902
01:01:24,206 --> 01:01:26,174
Does not exist yet?

903
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,676
That is the nature
of linear existence

904
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:31,838
and if you examine
it more closely

905
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,872
you will see that you
do not need to fear me.

906
01:01:46,628 --> 01:01:48,687
Partial field established.

907
01:01:48,764 --> 01:01:51,028
lnstability at 12%.

908
01:01:51,066 --> 01:01:53,034
Partial field?

909
01:01:56,405 --> 01:01:58,839
ls station's inertial mass
low enough to break orbit?

910
01:01:58,874 --> 01:02:00,603
Procedure is not recommended.

911
01:02:00,642 --> 01:02:02,633
Damn it, l didn't ask
for an opinion.

912
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:05,511
Just tell me whether or not
we can get enough thrust

913
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:07,640
with only a partial field
established.

914
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:08,980
Affirmative.

915
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,348
All right. Thank you.

916
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:14,982
lnitiate transit mode,
three-axis stabilization.

917
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:16,251
Aye, sir.

918
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:18,122
Engage thrusters.

919
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:31,104
Warning.
Field integrity declining.

920
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:33,334
lnstability at 21%.

921
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,570
We've got to close that gap
in the field

922
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:38,238
or we'll tear ourselves
into a million pieces.

923
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,249
Warning. Subspace field
collapse in 60 seconds.

924
01:02:41,283 --> 01:02:42,614
Computer

925
01:02:42,651 --> 01:02:45,211
transfer energy
from the inertial dampers

926
01:02:45,253 --> 01:02:47,380
to reinforce the subspace field.

927
01:02:47,422 --> 01:02:49,151
Procedure is not recommended.

928
01:02:49,191 --> 01:02:51,159
Damn it, transfer the energy.

929
01:02:51,193 --> 01:02:52,524
Unable to comply.

930
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:55,052
Level-1 safety protocols
have canceled request.

931
01:02:55,097 --> 01:02:56,394
Canceled it?

932
01:02:56,431 --> 01:02:59,400
Warning. Subspace field
collapse in 30 seconds.

933
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:01,629
l'm going to transfer it
manually.

934
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:05,333
On my mark, redirect the flow
to the deflectors

935
01:03:05,374 --> 01:03:06,398
and keep the power balanced.

936
01:03:06,441 --> 01:03:07,408
Aye, sir.

937
01:03:07,442 --> 01:03:10,002
Field collapse in 15 seconds.

938
01:03:11,346 --> 01:03:12,779
Now.

939
01:03:22,691 --> 01:03:25,023
Field energy
now within flight tolerances.

940
01:03:27,796 --> 01:03:30,060
Good work, sir.

941
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:39,798
Computer, you and l need
to have a little talk.

942
01:03:46,915 --> 01:03:50,282
The Cardassian warship
is in visual range.

943
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:52,411
On screen.

944
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,348
They're headed right to it.

945
01:03:56,391 --> 01:03:58,518
Well, they've got to listen
to reason, haven't they?

946
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,859
When we warn them what could
happen if they go in there.

947
01:04:01,897 --> 01:04:04,024
Doctor, most people,
in my experience

948
01:04:04,066 --> 01:04:07,524
wouldn't know reason if it
walked up and shook their hand.

949
01:04:07,569 --> 01:04:09,901
You can count Gul Dukat
among them.

950
01:04:09,938 --> 01:04:12,907
This is the Federation
Ship <i>Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

951
01:04:12,941 --> 01:04:15,102
Major Kira Nerys in command.

952
01:04:15,877 --> 01:04:17,504
Yes, Major.

953
01:04:17,546 --> 01:04:20,242
Gul Dukat, we know you're headed
for the wormhole.

954
01:04:20,282 --> 01:04:21,806
Wormhole?

955
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:25,047
What wormhole is that?

956
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,885
l strongly suggest
you do not proceed.

957
01:04:27,923 --> 01:04:31,154
We encountered
a hostile life-form inside.

958
01:04:31,193 --> 01:04:33,991
Perhaps they will be
less hostile to Cardassians

959
01:04:34,029 --> 01:04:35,496
than to humans.

960
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:36,929
Dukat

961
01:04:36,965 --> 01:04:38,432
these people are trying

962
01:04:38,467 --> 01:04:40,435
to save you
from a lot of trouble.

963
01:04:40,469 --> 01:04:41,595
Really?

964
01:04:41,636 --> 01:04:44,104
And l suppose
you're going to tell me

965
01:04:44,139 --> 01:04:46,164
that these are not
the life-forms

966
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:48,005
that have sent the Orbs

967
01:04:48,043 --> 01:04:50,773
or that your Commander Sisko
is not negotiating

968
01:04:50,812 --> 01:04:52,803
for their technology.

969
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:55,282
l thank you for your concern

970
01:04:55,317 --> 01:05:00,220
but l think we will see
for ourselves.

971
01:05:04,726 --> 01:05:07,126
So much for reason.

972
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:11,992
Jennifer.

973
01:05:22,344 --> 01:05:25,313
Yes, that was her name.

974
01:05:25,347 --> 01:05:27,645
She is part of your existence.

975
01:05:27,749 --> 01:05:29,740
She is part of my past.

976
01:05:29,784 --> 01:05:31,649
She's no longer alive.

977
01:05:31,686 --> 01:05:33,984
But she is part
of your existence.

978
01:05:34,022 --> 01:05:37,287
She was a most important
part of my existence

979
01:05:37,325 --> 01:05:39,293
but l lost her some time ago.

980
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,988
Lost?

981
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:42,792
What is this?

982
01:05:42,831 --> 01:05:46,858
ln a linear existence,
we can't go back to the past

983
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:49,370
to get something we left behind

984
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:53,431
so... it's lost.

985
01:05:53,475 --> 01:05:55,943
lt is inconceivable
that any species

986
01:05:55,977 --> 01:05:58,241
could exist in such a manner.

987
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,872
You are deceiving us.

988
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:01,212
No.

989
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:02,944
This is the truth.

990
01:06:02,984 --> 01:06:06,351
This day, this...
this park...

991
01:06:06,388 --> 01:06:12,293
it was almost 15 years
ago, far in the past.

992
01:06:12,327 --> 01:06:16,263
lt was a day that was
very important to me--

993
01:06:16,298 --> 01:06:20,598
a day that shaped
every day that followed.

994
01:06:20,635 --> 01:06:25,038
That is the essence
of a linear existence.

995
01:06:25,073 --> 01:06:29,237
Each day affects the next.

996
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:41,648
Listen to it.

997
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:44,352
To what?

998
01:06:44,392 --> 01:06:46,831
The sound of children playing.

999
01:06:46,964 --> 01:06:49,455
What could be more beautiful?

1000
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,229
So you like children.

1001
01:06:51,268 --> 01:06:55,227
That almost sounds
like a domestic inquiry.

1002
01:06:55,272 --> 01:06:58,241
l've heard Starfleet officers
don't want families

1003
01:06:58,275 --> 01:07:01,142
because they complicate
their lives.

1004
01:07:01,178 --> 01:07:03,806
Starfleet officers
don't often find mates

1005
01:07:03,848 --> 01:07:06,476
who want to raise families
on a starship.

1006
01:07:06,517 --> 01:07:09,884
That almost sounds
like a domestic inquiry.

1007
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,684
l think it was.

1008
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,512
As corporeal entities

1009
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:41,882
humans find physical
touch to cause pleasure.

1010
01:07:41,919 --> 01:07:43,284
Pleasure...

1011
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,584
what is this?

1012
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:49,622
Good feelings.

1013
01:07:49,727 --> 01:07:51,718
Happiness.

1014
01:07:56,233 --> 01:07:57,996
But this is your existence.

1015
01:07:58,035 --> 01:08:00,128
lt's difficult to be here--

1016
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:02,901
more difficult
than any other memory.

1017
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,771
Why?

1018
01:08:04,809 --> 01:08:06,333
Because...

1019
01:08:07,845 --> 01:08:10,837
because this was the day...

1020
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:14,608
that l lost Jennifer.

1021
01:08:18,522 --> 01:08:20,990
l don't want to be here.

1022
01:08:27,431 --> 01:08:30,229
Then why do you exist here?

1023
01:08:31,669 --> 01:08:34,467
l don't understand.

1024
01:08:34,505 --> 01:08:36,871
You exist here.

1025
01:08:47,485 --> 01:08:48,975
What's wrong?

1026
01:08:49,019 --> 01:08:51,044
What's happening?

1027
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,067
We should be reaching

1028
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:05,966
the wormhole coordinates
in two minutes.

1029
01:09:06,003 --> 01:09:08,597
Slowing to one-third imp...

1030
01:09:27,691 --> 01:09:29,488
Are you still there?

1031
01:09:29,527 --> 01:09:31,324
What just happened?

1032
01:09:31,362 --> 01:09:33,353
More of your kind.

1033
01:09:33,397 --> 01:09:35,024
Another ship...

1034
01:09:35,065 --> 01:09:36,692
in the wormhole?

1035
01:09:36,734 --> 01:09:38,201
Wormhole?

1036
01:09:38,235 --> 01:09:39,702
What is this?

1037
01:09:39,737 --> 01:09:41,364
lt is how we describe

1038
01:09:41,405 --> 01:09:43,566
the passage
that brought me here.

1039
01:09:43,607 --> 01:09:44,699
lt is terminated.

1040
01:09:44,742 --> 01:09:46,039
Terminated?

1041
01:09:46,076 --> 01:09:47,805
Our existence is disrupted

1042
01:09:47,845 --> 01:09:50,040
whenever one of you
enters the passage.

1043
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,015
Your linear nature
is inherently destructive.

1044
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:54,517
You have no regard

1045
01:09:54,552 --> 01:09:56,782
for the consequences
of your acts.

1046
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:57,947
That's not true.

1047
01:09:57,988 --> 01:10:00,479
We're aware that every choice
we make has a consequence.

1048
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:05,157
But you claim you do not know
what it will be.

1049
01:10:05,196 --> 01:10:06,322
We don't.

1050
01:10:06,363 --> 01:10:07,796
Then how can you take

1051
01:10:07,832 --> 01:10:10,130
responsibility
for your actions?

1052
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:12,795
We use past experience
to help guide us.

1053
01:10:12,837 --> 01:10:15,237
For Jennifer and me

1054
01:10:15,272 --> 01:10:17,399
all the experiences
in our lives

1055
01:10:17,441 --> 01:10:20,239
prepared us for the day
we met on the beach--

1056
01:10:20,277 --> 01:10:23,735
helped us recognize
that we had a future together.

1057
01:10:23,781 --> 01:10:25,749
When we married, we accepted

1058
01:10:25,783 --> 01:10:28,251
all the consequences
of that act

1059
01:10:28,285 --> 01:10:29,912
whatever they might be

1060
01:10:29,954 --> 01:10:32,252
including the consequences
of you.

1061
01:10:32,289 --> 01:10:33,586
Me?

1062
01:10:33,624 --> 01:10:35,319
My son Jake...

1063
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:37,452
The child with Jennifer.

1064
01:10:37,494 --> 01:10:39,587
Yes.

1065
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:43,122
Linear... procreation?

1066
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:44,464
Yes.

1067
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:47,595
Jake is the continuation
of our family.

1068
01:10:47,638 --> 01:10:50,436
The sound of children playing.

1069
01:10:51,242 --> 01:10:52,675
Aggressive.

1070
01:10:52,743 --> 01:10:54,370
Adversarial.

1071
01:10:54,411 --> 01:10:55,673
Competition.

1072
01:10:55,746 --> 01:10:57,077
For fun.

1073
01:10:57,114 --> 01:10:59,810
lt's a game that Jake
and l play on the holodeck.

1074
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:02,045
lt's called baseball.

1075
01:11:02,086 --> 01:11:03,883
Baseball?

1076
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:05,752
What is this?

1077
01:11:05,789 --> 01:11:09,088
l was afraid you'd ask that.

1078
01:11:09,126 --> 01:11:12,095
l throw this ball to you

1079
01:11:12,129 --> 01:11:16,532
and this other player
stands between us with a bat--

1080
01:11:16,567 --> 01:11:19,536
a stick-- and he...

1081
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:22,539
and he tries to hit the ball

1082
01:11:22,573 --> 01:11:25,371
in between
these two white lines.

1083
01:11:31,148 --> 01:11:32,775
Oh.

1084
01:11:32,816 --> 01:11:35,785
The rules aren't important.

1085
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:38,788
What's important is...

1086
01:11:38,822 --> 01:11:41,086
it's linear.

1087
01:11:41,125 --> 01:11:43,252
Every time l throw this ball

1088
01:11:43,294 --> 01:11:46,786
a hundred different things
can happen in a game.

1089
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,390
He might swing and miss,
he might hit it.

1090
01:11:49,433 --> 01:11:52,061
The point is you never know.

1091
01:11:52,102 --> 01:11:53,899
You try to anticipate

1092
01:11:53,938 --> 01:11:57,237
set a strategy
for all the possibilities

1093
01:11:57,274 --> 01:11:59,674
as best you can, but in the end

1094
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:02,712
it comes down to throwing
one pitch after another

1095
01:12:02,746 --> 01:12:04,771
and seeing what happens.

1096
01:12:04,815 --> 01:12:08,615
With each new consequence,
the game begins to take shape.

1097
01:12:08,652 --> 01:12:11,143
And you have no idea
what that shape is

1098
01:12:11,188 --> 01:12:12,815
until it is completed.

1099
01:12:12,856 --> 01:12:13,823
That's right.

1100
01:12:13,857 --> 01:12:16,189
ln fact, the game
wouldn't be worth playing

1101
01:12:16,226 --> 01:12:18,626
if we knew
what was going to happen.

1102
01:12:18,729 --> 01:12:22,631
You value your ignorance
of what is to come?

1103
01:12:22,733 --> 01:12:25,361
That may be
the most important thing

1104
01:12:25,402 --> 01:12:27,370
to understand about humans.

1105
01:12:27,404 --> 01:12:31,067
lt is the unknown
that defines our existence.

1106
01:12:31,108 --> 01:12:33,406
We are constantly searching

1107
01:12:33,444 --> 01:12:35,639
not just for answers
to our questions

1108
01:12:35,746 --> 01:12:38,044
but for new questions.

1109
01:12:38,082 --> 01:12:40,050
We are explorers.

1110
01:12:40,084 --> 01:12:43,247
We explore our lives day by day

1111
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:45,255
and we explore the galaxy

1112
01:12:45,289 --> 01:12:48,918
trying to expand
the boundaries of our knowledge

1113
01:12:48,959 --> 01:12:51,427
and that is why l am here--

1114
01:12:51,462 --> 01:12:53,828
not to conquer you with weapons

1115
01:12:53,864 --> 01:12:56,833
or with ideas

1116
01:12:56,867 --> 01:12:59,495
but to coexist...

1117
01:12:59,536 --> 01:13:01,197
and learn.

1118
01:13:03,707 --> 01:13:05,504
lf all you say is true

1119
01:13:05,542 --> 01:13:07,635
why do you exist here?

1120
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:23,911
First Officer's Log,
supplemental.

1121
01:13:23,952 --> 01:13:25,715
We've rendezvoused
with the space station

1122
01:13:25,754 --> 01:13:27,949
at the former coordinates
of the wormhole.

1123
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:30,049
Unfortunately,
our scans have revealed

1124
01:13:30,092 --> 01:13:33,584
no trace of either the wormhole
or Dukat's ship.

1125
01:13:33,629 --> 01:13:34,596
A few minutes ago

1126
01:13:34,663 --> 01:13:37,188
three Cardassian warships
crossed the border

1127
01:13:37,232 --> 01:13:39,063
no doubt on their way
to search for Dukat.

1128
01:13:39,101 --> 01:13:42,002
Mr. O'Brien, can you establish
a high-energy thoron field

1129
01:13:42,037 --> 01:13:44,028
before they get
into sensor range?

1130
01:13:44,072 --> 01:13:46,267
l don't want them
to be able to scan

1131
01:13:46,308 --> 01:13:48,208
-our defense systems.
-Aye, sir.

1132
01:13:48,243 --> 01:13:50,211
They're hailing us.

1133
01:13:50,245 --> 01:13:52,736
On screen.

1134
01:13:53,482 --> 01:13:55,746
l am Gul Jasad

1135
01:13:55,784 --> 01:13:59,413
of the Cardassian guard,
Seventh Order.

1136
01:13:59,455 --> 01:14:01,787
Where is our warship?

1137
01:14:01,824 --> 01:14:04,793
With any luck,
they're in the Gamma Quadrant

1138
01:14:04,827 --> 01:14:06,089
on the other side
of the wormhole.

1139
01:14:06,128 --> 01:14:07,425
What wormhole?

1140
01:14:07,463 --> 01:14:09,863
Our sensors show no indication

1141
01:14:09,898 --> 01:14:12,025
of a wormhole in this sector.

1142
01:14:12,067 --> 01:14:14,467
That's because
it just collapsed.

1143
01:14:14,503 --> 01:14:15,970
What?!

1144
01:14:16,004 --> 01:14:18,336
We believe it was
artificially created.

1145
01:14:18,373 --> 01:14:21,274
That may be why our sensors
never picked up

1146
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:24,279
any of the usual quantum
fluctuation patterns.

1147
01:14:24,313 --> 01:14:27,942
You expect me to believe
that someone created a wormhole

1148
01:14:27,983 --> 01:14:30,713
and now conveniently
has disassembled it?

1149
01:14:30,752 --> 01:14:33,778
That's exactly
what l expect you to believe.

1150
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:40,424
They're flooding subspace
with antilepton interference.

1151
01:14:40,462 --> 01:14:42,589
lt'll cut off our communications
with Starfleet.

1152
01:14:42,698 --> 01:14:44,495
They're powering up
their forward phasers.

1153
01:14:44,533 --> 01:14:45,898
Red Alert.

1154
01:14:45,934 --> 01:14:46,901
Shields up.

1155
01:14:46,935 --> 01:14:48,562
What shields?

1156
01:14:48,604 --> 01:14:52,438
They're hailing us again.

1157
01:14:53,742 --> 01:14:55,573
Open the channel.

1158
01:14:56,345 --> 01:14:59,746
We do not accept
your explanation.

1159
01:14:59,781 --> 01:15:02,841
Somehow you have destroyed
our warship.

1160
01:15:02,885 --> 01:15:05,854
Gul Jasad, l assure you...

1161
01:15:05,888 --> 01:15:10,552
We demand the unconditional
surrender of this space station

1162
01:15:10,592 --> 01:15:12,992
or we will open fire.

1163
01:15:16,064 --> 01:15:18,032
l need at least a day

1164
01:15:18,066 --> 01:15:20,626
to make the necessary
preparations.

1165
01:15:23,171 --> 01:15:27,130
You have one hour.

1166
01:15:47,296 --> 01:15:49,730
l can transfer
all available power

1167
01:15:49,765 --> 01:15:52,131
to establish partial shields
around critical areas

1168
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:54,397
but if they hit the docking ring

1169
01:15:54,436 --> 01:15:55,926
we'll sustain heavy damage.

1170
01:15:55,971 --> 01:15:58,599
Constable,
if you would coordinate

1171
01:15:58,674 --> 01:16:00,835
moving all personnel
to safer locations.

1172
01:16:04,046 --> 01:16:06,844
What was the last reported
position of the <i>Enterprise?</i>

1173
01:16:06,882 --> 01:16:09,407
At least 20 hours away.

1174
01:16:09,451 --> 01:16:12,113
We've got to hold out
till they get here.

1175
01:16:12,154 --> 01:16:13,746
l can't believe the Cardassians

1176
01:16:13,789 --> 01:16:15,848
would ever attack
a Federation outpost.

1177
01:16:15,891 --> 01:16:17,188
Doctor, you ever studied

1178
01:16:17,225 --> 01:16:19,193
your military history
of the border wars?

1179
01:16:19,227 --> 01:16:20,194
Yes.

1180
01:16:20,228 --> 01:16:22,025
Ever heard
of the Setlik lll massacre?

1181
01:16:22,064 --> 01:16:23,895
l assume, Mr. O'Brien,
you would agree

1182
01:16:23,932 --> 01:16:25,923
surrender is not
a preferable option.

1183
01:16:25,968 --> 01:16:28,300
You know what they do
to their prisoners, sir.

1184
01:16:45,687 --> 01:16:48,554
What is the point of bringing me
back again to this?

1185
01:16:50,225 --> 01:16:52,216
We do not bring you here.

1186
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,558
You bring us here.

1187
01:16:54,596 --> 01:16:57,497
You exist here.

1188
01:16:57,532 --> 01:16:59,227
Then give me the power

1189
01:16:59,267 --> 01:17:02,395
to lead you somewhere
else-- anywhere else.

1190
01:17:02,437 --> 01:17:06,271
We cannot give you
what you deny yourself.

1191
01:17:06,308 --> 01:17:09,869
Look for solutions from within,
Commander.

1192
01:17:16,752 --> 01:17:20,552
l was ready to die with her.

1193
01:17:20,656 --> 01:17:22,715
Die... what is this?

1194
01:17:24,026 --> 01:17:28,395
The termination
of their linear existence.

1195
01:17:41,576 --> 01:17:43,874
We've got to go now, sir.

1196
01:17:43,912 --> 01:17:45,379
Damn it!

1197
01:17:45,414 --> 01:17:47,882
We just can't leave her here.

1198
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:51,750
Oh! Oh, no!

1199
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:56,990
l never left this ship.

1200
01:17:57,025 --> 01:17:59,220
You exist here.

1201
01:18:02,431 --> 01:18:05,525
l...

1202
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,591
exist here.

1203
01:18:23,285 --> 01:18:26,311
l don't know
if you can understand.

1204
01:18:26,354 --> 01:18:28,515
l see her like this

1205
01:18:28,557 --> 01:18:32,254
every time l close my eyes.

1206
01:18:32,294 --> 01:18:35,263
ln the darkness...

1207
01:18:35,297 --> 01:18:38,562
in the blink of an eye

1208
01:18:38,633 --> 01:18:42,569
l see her like this.

1209
01:18:42,604 --> 01:18:45,437
None of your past experiences
helped prepare you

1210
01:18:45,474 --> 01:18:46,964
for this consequence.

1211
01:18:47,008 --> 01:18:53,140
And l have never figured out
how to live without her.

1212
01:18:53,181 --> 01:18:56,446
So you choose to exist here.

1213
01:19:01,156 --> 01:19:03,056
lt is not linear.

1214
01:19:04,659 --> 01:19:06,627
No.

1215
01:19:06,661 --> 01:19:08,822
lt's not linear.

1216
01:19:33,321 --> 01:19:35,152
Oh...

1217
01:19:48,804 --> 01:19:51,773
Their lead ship is hailing us.

1218
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,275
Gul Jasad wants an answer.

1219
01:19:54,309 --> 01:19:56,277
Are you ready, Mr. O'Brien?

1220
01:19:56,311 --> 01:19:57,938
Yes, sir.

1221
01:19:57,979 --> 01:20:00,447
When they penetrate
our thoron field

1222
01:20:00,482 --> 01:20:03,451
it should raise a few
eyebrows over there.

1223
01:20:03,485 --> 01:20:06,784
All right, then,
let's give them our answer.

1224
01:20:06,822 --> 01:20:10,383
Fire six photon torpedoes
across Jasad's bow.

1225
01:20:10,425 --> 01:20:13,223
We only have six photons, Major.

1226
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:16,526
We're not going to win this
battle with torpedoes, Chief.

1227
01:20:16,565 --> 01:20:18,726
Aye, sir.

1228
01:20:23,605 --> 01:20:25,732
An urgent hail from Jasad.

1229
01:20:25,774 --> 01:20:27,969
Looks like we got his attention.

1230
01:20:29,611 --> 01:20:31,044
On screen.

1231
01:20:31,711 --> 01:20:33,008
This is your answer?

1232
01:20:33,046 --> 01:20:34,138
You don't think

1233
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,740
Starfleet took command
of this space station

1234
01:20:36,783 --> 01:20:38,978
without the ability
to defend it, do you?

1235
01:20:39,018 --> 01:20:40,007
Defend it?

1236
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,419
Your space station
could not defend itself

1237
01:20:44,457 --> 01:20:47,483
against one Cardassian warship.

1238
01:20:47,527 --> 01:20:49,825
You're probably right, Jasad...

1239
01:20:51,798 --> 01:20:55,427
and if you were dealing
with a Starfleet officer

1240
01:20:55,468 --> 01:20:57,436
they'd probably admit

1241
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:00,439
we have a hopeless cause here

1242
01:21:00,473 --> 01:21:03,772
but l am just a Bajoran

1243
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:05,277
who's been fighting

1244
01:21:05,311 --> 01:21:08,576
a hopeless cause
against the Cardassians

1245
01:21:08,648 --> 01:21:11,549
all her life.

1246
01:21:11,584 --> 01:21:14,382
So if you want a war...

1247
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:17,218
l'll give you one.

1248
01:21:23,596 --> 01:21:25,223
Major.

1249
01:21:25,265 --> 01:21:27,733
Remind me never
to get into a game

1250
01:21:27,767 --> 01:21:30,258
of Roladan Wild Draw with you.

1251
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:46,016
They were using a thoron field
to block our sensors

1252
01:21:46,052 --> 01:21:47,986
but we were able
to penetrate it.

1253
01:21:48,021 --> 01:21:50,489
What are their defenses?

1254
01:21:50,523 --> 01:21:54,857
According to our scans,
an estimated 5,000 photons

1255
01:21:54,894 --> 01:21:57,624
integrated phaser banks
on all levels.

1256
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:00,164
When did they receive
these armaments?

1257
01:22:00,199 --> 01:22:02,827
And how did they install
them without our knowledge?

1258
01:22:04,304 --> 01:22:09,708
Somehow they have created
a massive illusion

1259
01:22:09,742 --> 01:22:12,404
of duranium shadows.

1260
01:22:12,445 --> 01:22:14,538
What if it is not an illusion?

1261
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,979
lt is.

1262
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:17,949
Why risk the confrontation?

1263
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:21,044
The Fourth Order
can be here in a day.

1264
01:22:21,087 --> 01:22:23,112
So can Starfleet.

1265
01:22:27,827 --> 01:22:30,352
Their lead ship is sending out
a subspace message

1266
01:22:30,396 --> 01:22:31,761
asking for reinforcements.

1267
01:22:31,798 --> 01:22:32,765
Yes!

1268
01:22:32,799 --> 01:22:35,461
Too soon for
a victory celebration, Doctor.

1269
01:22:36,803 --> 01:22:37,929
Mr. O'Brien?

1270
01:22:37,971 --> 01:22:39,097
The ships are being deployed

1271
01:22:39,138 --> 01:22:41,800
in a standard
attack formation, sir.

1272
01:22:42,942 --> 01:22:44,933
Battle stations.

1273
01:22:54,787 --> 01:22:56,914
Quickly, now.
Quickly, now.

1274
01:22:56,956 --> 01:22:58,423
Calmly, calmly.

1275
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:00,119
Come along.

1276
01:23:01,327 --> 01:23:03,158
They may just be testing us.

1277
01:23:03,196 --> 01:23:05,790
l could run a pulse
compression wave

1278
01:23:05,832 --> 01:23:07,800
through the phaser banks--

1279
01:23:07,834 --> 01:23:10,234
put out a blast that will
make them think twice.

1280
01:23:10,269 --> 01:23:11,258
Do it.

1281
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,707
Damage report.

1282
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:20,372
Direct hit, level 14.

1283
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:22,040
Empty storage bays.

1284
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:23,378
No casualties.

1285
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:26,078
Shields down to 27%.

1286
01:23:49,175 --> 01:23:52,736
A fuel conduit
has ruptured on the Promenade.

1287
01:23:52,779 --> 01:23:55,748
Can you divert
the main power flow?

1288
01:23:56,983 --> 01:23:58,245
The controls are locked.

1289
01:23:58,284 --> 01:23:59,342
Odo to Ops.

1290
01:23:59,385 --> 01:24:00,352
Go ahead.

1291
01:24:00,386 --> 01:24:01,910
l've got wounded people
down here!

1292
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:04,184
Have you seen that Doctor
of yours anywhere?

1293
01:24:04,223 --> 01:24:05,451
l'm on my way.

1294
01:24:08,594 --> 01:24:10,994
l'm going to have to shut down
the primary power flow

1295
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:12,588
or the whole Promenade
will go up.

1296
01:24:14,067 --> 01:24:15,694
Bloody Cardassians!

1297
01:24:15,735 --> 01:24:18,067
l just got the damn thing fixed.

1298
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:32,413
Press there, hard.

1299
01:24:33,619 --> 01:24:36,713
Look, Doctor, maybe l should
find you someone...

1300
01:24:36,756 --> 01:24:40,317
Hold it there.

1301
01:24:51,771 --> 01:24:54,535
That should do it for a while.

1302
01:24:54,574 --> 01:24:56,542
Shields are at 18% and falling.

1303
01:24:56,576 --> 01:24:58,737
l might still be able
to give you

1304
01:24:58,778 --> 01:25:00,712
one more phaser blast, Major.

1305
01:25:00,746 --> 01:25:02,441
No.

1306
01:25:13,426 --> 01:25:16,725
Signal the lead Cardassian ship
that we will proceed with...

1307
01:25:16,762 --> 01:25:17,729
Major...

1308
01:25:17,763 --> 01:25:19,993
l'm picking up
a huge neutrino disturbance

1309
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:22,557
15 kilometers
off the forward docking ring.

1310
01:25:22,602 --> 01:25:24,593
lt's the wormhole.

1311
01:25:25,938 --> 01:25:28,236
On screen.

1312
01:25:31,577 --> 01:25:33,568
Hail the lead ship.

1313
01:25:33,646 --> 01:25:35,273
What did l tell you, Jasad?

1314
01:25:35,314 --> 01:25:37,248
There's your wormhole!

1315
01:25:47,426 --> 01:25:48,916
<i>Rio Grande</i> to DS9.

1316
01:25:48,961 --> 01:25:50,053
On screen.

1317
01:25:50,096 --> 01:25:51,586
Go ahead, Commander.

1318
01:25:51,631 --> 01:25:52,825
Sorry to be late, Major.

1319
01:25:52,865 --> 01:25:55,026
Our friend Gul Dukat
had some problems

1320
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,830
on the other side
of the wormhole.

1321
01:25:56,869 --> 01:25:58,928
l see you've had
a few of your own.

1322
01:25:58,971 --> 01:26:00,802
A few, Commander.

1323
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:05,741
Gul Dukat is signaling
his ships to disarm.

1324
01:26:05,778 --> 01:26:07,905
Clear me for docking,
Mr. O'Brien.

1325
01:26:07,947 --> 01:26:09,346
Aye, sir.

1326
01:26:09,382 --> 01:26:11,373
Cleared for Pad C.

1327
01:26:38,077 --> 01:26:39,874
Casualties?

1328
01:26:39,912 --> 01:26:43,746
13 injured, Commander,
and no fatalities.

1329
01:26:48,487 --> 01:26:50,387
Jake!

1330
01:26:51,424 --> 01:26:52,482
Dad!

1331
01:27:04,036 --> 01:27:06,698
Station Log,
Commander Benjamin Sisko

1332
01:27:06,739 --> 01:27:09,674
Stardate 46393.1.

1333
01:27:09,709 --> 01:27:11,540
The life-forms
who created the wormhole

1334
01:27:11,611 --> 01:27:13,101
have agreed
to allow safe passage

1335
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:15,545
for all ships traveling
to the Gamma Quadrant.

1336
01:27:15,581 --> 01:27:17,071
With the arrival
of the <i>Enterprise</i>

1337
01:27:17,116 --> 01:27:19,448
the Cardassians
have left the area.

1338
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,954
l suspect that the sight
of their warship

1339
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:25,981
being towed
by a Federation runabout

1340
01:27:26,025 --> 01:27:27,822
took the heart
out of their fight.

1341
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:30,761
We're not done
with the Cardassians yet--

1342
01:27:30,796 --> 01:27:34,288
not with the strategic
importance of that wormhole.

1343
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:36,426
Well, you've put Bajor
on the map, Commander.

1344
01:27:36,469 --> 01:27:40,269
This will shortly become
a leading center of commerce

1345
01:27:40,306 --> 01:27:42,433
and of scientific exploration

1346
01:27:42,475 --> 01:27:46,536
and for Starfleet,
one of our most important posts.

1347
01:27:46,579 --> 01:27:49,104
Captain,
regarding our conversation

1348
01:27:49,148 --> 01:27:51,275
about someone to replace me...

1349
01:27:51,317 --> 01:27:52,841
Yes, l'm sorry
l haven't had time yet

1350
01:27:52,885 --> 01:27:55,251
to communicate that to Command.

1351
01:27:55,288 --> 01:27:58,382
l would prefer you ignore it,
sir.

1352
01:27:58,424 --> 01:28:01,416
l'm not sure that l can.

1353
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:03,428
Are you certain
that's what you want?

1354
01:28:03,462 --> 01:28:05,259
Because we cannot afford to have

1355
01:28:05,298 --> 01:28:07,289
a commanding officer who is...

1356
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:09,699
l'm certain, sir.

1357
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,671
Good luck, Mr. Sisko.

1358
01:28:36,595 --> 01:28:40,554
So, where can someone practice
with his phaser around here?

1359
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:42,896
New rules?

1360
01:28:42,935 --> 01:28:44,425
You can't cheat every customer

1361
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:46,665
who walks through the door
anymore, Quark.

1362
01:28:46,706 --> 01:28:49,004
You are a community leader now.

1363
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:50,838
Very well, very well.

1364
01:28:50,876 --> 01:28:54,778
Perhaps we could discuss
these new rules over a drink.

1365
01:28:56,982 --> 01:29:00,418
lf you don't take
that hand off my hip

1366
01:29:00,453 --> 01:29:03,684
you'll never be able
to raise a glass with it again.

1367
01:29:10,162 --> 01:29:13,393
Oh, l love a woman in uniform.

1368
01:29:14,567 --> 01:29:16,228
...and three Frunalian
Science Vessels

1369
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:18,065
are requesting
permission to dock.

1370
01:29:18,104 --> 01:29:21,232
Problem is we've been
retrofitting the air locks, sir.

1371
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:23,741
Half of them were damaged
during the move

1372
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:25,038
and most of the others

1373
01:29:25,077 --> 01:29:27,875
when the Cardassians
blew out the fuel conduits.

1374
01:29:27,913 --> 01:29:30,575
l guess they'll just have
to transport aboard...
