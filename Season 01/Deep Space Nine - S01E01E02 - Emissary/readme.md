Episode Processing:

 If you want to correct the stuttering of the intial scolling text, process the first 450 frames of _intro.avs.  

Run both of the resulting MKV files through Video Enahance AI.  Copy the frames of the scrolling text over the
top of the files in the full video folder and continue the process as normal.
