1
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:06,960
Station Log, Stardate 46925.1.

2
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:08,692
We have been honored
with a visit

3
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:10,496
by a delegation
of Federation ambassadors

4
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:13,094
on a fact-finding mission
to the wormhole.

5
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:15,605
Fortunately,
l have just the officer

6
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,504
to take them off my hands.

7
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,908
l only wish there was something
l could do, Ambassador.

8
00:00:20,945 --> 00:00:22,606
Madam Ambassador.

9
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:23,977
Madam Ambassador.

10
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,539
But all the guest
quarters on the station

11
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:28,484
are roughly the same size.

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,851
Then move me to the crew level.

13
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:32,651
All the quarters
on the crew level

14
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,952
are currently occupied.

15
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:35,686
Then someone can move.

16
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:38,184
You, for example.

17
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:41,925
She did the same thing
during the voyage here.

18
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:43,558
She's never satisfied.

19
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:46,866
At least l didn't bother
the Captain every hour

20
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:50,431
with some new suggestion
on how to run his ship.

21
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:52,135
He welcomed my suggestions

22
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:55,543
as l'm sure your Commander Sisko
will welcome them

23
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,946
if we ever get
to spend any time with him.

24
00:00:58,983 --> 00:01:01,213
Well, Commander Sisko
is extremely busy.

25
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:02,684
With what?

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,555
With... the...
recalibration sweep.

27
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,354
What are you recalibrating?

28
00:01:09,393 --> 00:01:10,690
Mmm? Everything.

29
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:12,161
Um, it's a sweeping...

30
00:01:12,263 --> 00:01:14,731
uh, a recalibration
of all systems.

31
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:18,633
l cannot speak for the others,
but l would be fascinated

32
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:21,035
to observe this recalibration,
Doctor.

33
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:22,163
You would?

34
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:23,764
Well, after your long trip

35
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:26,971
l thought you might enjoy
stopping by a holosuite.

36
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:29,070
Are you actually suggesting

37
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:32,810
we indulge in one of those
disgusting Ferengi sex programs?

38
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,011
No.

39
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:38,180
l... the holosuites are capable
of many different...

40
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,722
Of course

41
00:01:39,757 --> 00:01:41,315
that's what he was suggesting.

42
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:44,418
The Arbazan
are so sexually repressed.

43
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:47,488
Why, this is outrageous.

44
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,931
Perhaps we should all
just get some rest.

45
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:53,095
l did not come all this way
to rest, Doctor.

46
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:55,162
l would like to see
your facility.

47
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:58,334
A first-year officer
assigned as our liaison.

48
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,208
Starfleet Command
will hear of this.

49
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:03,270
Ambassador...
Madam Ambassador

50
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:04,474
l'm only...

51
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,142
Oh, where is it?!

52
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:08,344
Oh, it's gone, it's gone!

53
00:02:08,385 --> 00:02:10,410
What's gone, Madam Ambassador?

54
00:02:10,454 --> 00:02:12,149
Oh, my latinum hairbrooch.

55
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:13,315
Quark!

56
00:02:13,357 --> 00:02:16,053
l had just made
my third straight cross.

57
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:18,288
l was leaning across the table
to pick up the dice again

58
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,092
something brushed against me

59
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,097
and my God!

60
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:22,393
l've been wigged.

61
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,799
What's the problem, here?

62
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:27,326
Someone has stolen Ambassador
Troi's latinum hairbrooch.

63
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:30,169
l'm sorry, but as the sign says,
the establishment

64
00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:31,536
is not responsible

65
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:33,736
for the loss
of any personal items.

66
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:34,937
Sign? What sign?

67
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:36,503
The one above the door.

68
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,515
You'd have to stand on a chair
to read that.

69
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:39,516
House rules.

70
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,710
l'm very sorry.

71
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:42,309
Have a nice day.

72
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,480
You are dealing

73
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:45,716
with the daughter
of the Fifth House

74
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:47,053
Holder of the Sacred
Chalice of Rixx

75
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:49,753
Heir to the Holy
Rings of Betazed.

76
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:51,158
Not my ear, please!

77
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:53,527
Yes, and l know
where it hurts the most

78
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:54,724
you little troll.

79
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:56,995
Now, l want this room sealed

80
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:59,059
and l want everyone
in it strip-searched

81
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:00,400
until you find my brooch.

82
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:02,064
May l be of service?

83
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:03,334
Oh, thank goodness.

84
00:03:03,374 --> 00:03:05,308
Our Chief of Security, Odo.

85
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:07,401
What seems to be the problem?

86
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:09,139
Well, my brooch has been stolen.

87
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:12,306
lt's been in my family
for 36 generations.

88
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:14,909
lt's absolutely priceless
and l want it back.

89
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:17,750
You're certain
you were wearing it today?

90
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:18,982
Yes, of course l'm certain.

91
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:21,150
l never use this hair
without it.

92
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:23,693
l see.

93
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:25,752
You're... Betazoid?

94
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,423
Of course.

95
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:29,159
Telepathic?

96
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,962
Yes.

97
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,231
And you sense no guilt
anywhere in this room?

98
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:45,411
No, but Betazoids
cannot read Ferengis.

99
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,384
Quark has plenty of reason
to feel guilty

100
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:51,650
but he usually doesn't
have to resort to petty theft

101
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,179
to fleece his clients.

102
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:55,248
Thank you.

103
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:17,605
Wait a minute.

104
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:19,616
Empty your pockets now.

105
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:21,876
Well...

106
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,911
since when did you
join Starfleet?

107
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,492
That's it-- that's my brooch.

108
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:30,652
But how did you know?

109
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:33,162
Dopterians are distant
relatives of the Ferengi.

110
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:35,757
lt made sense that, since
you couldn't read Quark

111
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:38,768
you might not be able to read
this charming fellow either.

112
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:41,532
Oh, how perfectly
brilliant of you.

113
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:46,836
Doctor, l want to know
everything there is to know

114
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:48,970
about your Security Chief.

115
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:57,327
Computer, is the diagnostic

116
00:06:57,364 --> 00:06:59,730
on the fusion power plant
finished yet?

117
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:00,791
Affirmative.

118
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:03,065
The fusion power plant
is operating

119
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,933
within normal parameters.

120
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:07,065
What are you talking about?

121
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:10,075
lt's 13% below normal.

122
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:11,735
Cardassian specifications

123
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,839
accept operating efficiency
within 20%.

124
00:07:14,882 --> 00:07:16,213
Well, l don't.

125
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,217
Anara.

126
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:18,479
Yes, sir.

127
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:21,579
How much do you know
about carbon reaction chambers?

128
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:24,090
l've learned a little
about laser-induced fusion

129
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:25,716
not much more than the basics.

130
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,317
Ah, it's a bloody
inefficient system.

131
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:30,228
l'd trade it in for a Federation
model tomorrow if l could

132
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:31,424
but it's all we've got.

133
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:32,762
Do me a favor.

134
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,567
Keep an eye on the exhaust
plasma temperature.

135
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:39,869
Computer, increase
deuterium flow

136
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:42,705
by five percent
to reaction chamber two.

137
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:44,711
Procedure is not recommended.

138
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:47,305
Look, l've had enough
of your opinions, damn it.

139
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:49,441
Just do it!

140
00:07:49,483 --> 00:07:51,348
Procedure is not recommended.

141
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:53,751
Consult Cardassian
operational guidelines

142
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:55,880
paragraph 254-A, now on screen.

143
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:58,619
l don't want to read
your tech manual.

144
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,648
Fine.

145
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:01,490
We'll do it ourselves.

146
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:06,064
Reinitializing reactor two.

147
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:11,001
Directing plasma flow
to conduits 143, 144...

148
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,302
Chief O'Brien, the power flow
from reactor two

149
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,568
has just been shut down.

150
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:15,836
What?

151
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:18,902
Computer, analyze
reactor two failure.

152
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:22,074
Reactor two was shut down
after sensors detected

153
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:25,709
a potential overload
of the carbon reaction chambers.

154
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:27,721
That's it.
That's the straw!

155
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:28,779
Relax, Chief.

156
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:30,380
lt's just a computer.

157
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:31,823
This is no computer.

158
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,087
This is my archenemy.

159
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:35,093
You've got it working
just fine, as far l can tell.

160
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:37,095
Fine? With all due respect,
Commander

161
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:40,098
as an engineer, l couldn't
look at myself in the mirror

162
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,667
if l allowed this computer

163
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:43,727
to continue to perform
as it is now.

164
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:45,705
l'll have to do a root canal.

165
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:46,728
Root canal?

166
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:48,298
lt's engineering shorthand, sir.

167
00:08:48,342 --> 00:08:49,775
l'll have to get into its guts

168
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,471
and rebuild it
from the ground up.

169
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:52,809
How long will that take?

170
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:54,245
Well, l'm still
not that familiar

171
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,407
with Cardassian technology

172
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:58,748
but, oh, l guess no more
than two, three years.

173
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:01,118
That's going to take
a lot of man-hours.

174
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:02,381
ls it really necessary?

175
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:04,186
You don't understand...

176
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:06,351
Let's just say l don't have

177
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:08,361
your sensitivity
to the computer.

178
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:09,555
That's all right.
Forget about it.

179
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:10,563
Uh, Chief...

180
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:11,791
lt's all right.
lt doesn't matter.

181
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:14,801
Chief, l want you to do
what you have to do.

182
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:16,063
Thank you, sir.

183
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,762
l'll get right on it.

184
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:19,670
And this is Ops.

185
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:23,234
The heart and soul
of Deep Space 9.

186
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:26,075
Ah, there you are, Commander.

187
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,546
Gentlemen, Madam Ambassador.

188
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:31,312
They insisted on seeing
operations, sir.

189
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:32,319
Of course.

190
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:34,184
Make yourselves at home.

191
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:36,189
l trust that Doctor Bashir

192
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:38,691
has been taking care
of all your needs.

193
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:42,355
Well, he refuses to change
my accommodations.

194
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:43,556
Accommodations?

195
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:46,361
Well, if l have to sleep
another night

196
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,597
on a Cardassian bed
with gargoyles staring at me

197
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:51,194
from the wood poles...

198
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:53,069
Commander.

199
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:56,668
An unidentified vessel
is coming through the wormhole.

200
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,109
On screen.
Excuse me.

201
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:01,375
Uh, you'll get a better view
from over here.

202
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:12,456
Quite a sight, isn't it?

203
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:13,926
That's it?

204
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,690
That's the whole thing?

205
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:17,094
Well, yes, it is.

206
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:19,122
l was expecting more, somehow.

207
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:22,725
Scanners aren't picking up
any life-forms on board.

208
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,737
A probe?

209
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:24,897
Might be.

210
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,906
l'm reading an extensive
computer array

211
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,103
but no signals to suggest
it's trying to maintain contact

212
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:31,702
with a mother ship.

213
00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:33,610
Are the computers
compatible with ours?

214
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:34,978
lt's hard to tell.

215
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:38,507
l don't recognize any known
subprocessor patterns.

216
00:10:38,552 --> 00:10:40,076
Obviously, the young woman
doesn't have

217
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,144
the necessary experience.

218
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:42,155
Perhaps l can...

219
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:43,849
The ''young woman'' over there

220
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:46,621
has over 300 years
experience, Ambassador.

221
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,423
l might have better luck

222
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:51,022
if we towed it
into the docking ring.

223
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:52,828
No, not until we know
a little bit more about it.

224
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:55,699
Major, tow it to 500 meters
off the docking ring.

225
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:56,998
Yes, sir.

226
00:10:57,037 --> 00:10:59,631
Mr. O'Brien, try to set up
an adaptive interface link

227
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:02,164
and see if we can download
any information from it.

228
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:03,198
Aye, sir.

229
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:07,946
l think it will be best
if we clear this area.

230
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:11,439
But this probe may represent
contact with a new species.

231
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:13,817
Commander, l think
it would be appropriate

232
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:15,321
for at least one
Federation ambassador

233
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:17,346
to be present
at this historic occasion

234
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:19,359
and since l have
a particular interest

235
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:20,917
in First Contact procedures...

236
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:23,395
l appreciate your interest,
Ambassador

237
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,593
and to keep you all informed,
l'm scheduling a briefing

238
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:28,032
at 0400.

239
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:29,365
ln the meantime, Dr. Bashir

240
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:31,735
the best place
to view this probe

241
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:33,535
is from the docking ring
near Port Seven.

242
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:36,134
l'll show them the way.

243
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,478
Such concentration.

244
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:06,289
Such intensity,
such passion for your work.

245
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:09,023
Tracking intergalactic
malefactors.

246
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:12,829
Most people find it
rather tedious.

247
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:14,198
Tedious?

248
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:18,304
No, those of us
who have been beneficiaries

249
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:19,636
of your heroism

250
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:22,234
would never call
your work tedious.

251
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:24,801
We've learned that,
on this station

252
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:28,714
you are the thin, beige line
between order and chaos.

253
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,717
That's my job.

254
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,379
Now, what can l do for you?

255
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,549
You haven't lost
anything else, l hope.

256
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,717
Only my heart.

257
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,990
l beg your pardon?

258
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,929
ls, um...

259
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:47,025
is Odo your first or last name?

260
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:48,330
Yes.

261
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:50,667
Oh. Then l can
just call you, uh...?

262
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:52,536
Odo.

263
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,673
lt has a certain
lyrical quality.

264
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:59,077
Lyrical?

265
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,478
Odo...

266
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,677
lt rolls off the tongue.

267
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:05,447
Uh...

268
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:07,511
l have a lot of work to do.

269
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:11,047
l understand
you're a shape-shifter.

270
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:12,557
That's correct.

271
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,185
l've never been
with a shape-shifter.

272
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,653
''Been with?''

273
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:21,134
l've heard that you're
the only one of your kind.

274
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,199
So far.

275
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,500
Mmm.

276
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,302
All the men l've known

277
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:31,641
have needed to be shaped,
and molded, and manipulated

278
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,909
and finally l've met a man

279
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:36,712
who knows how to do it himself.

280
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,150
Oh...

281
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:40,852
ls that the com?

282
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,253
l think it is.

283
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,257
Excuse me.

284
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,350
l've got to get to Ops.

285
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,041
lnitiating high-resolution scan.

286
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:05,705
Memory nodes located.

287
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:08,214
Proceeding with data transfer.

288
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:10,240
Yeah, there you go.

289
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,546
Who would have thought?

290
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,382
You seem surprised, Chief.

291
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:16,356
Well, knowing this computer,
l thought l would have had

292
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,517
to reconfigure
the whole emulator module

293
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,027
to make it compatible
with the probe

294
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:23,053
but it's cooperating for once.

295
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:25,463
Transfer of data is complete.

296
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:28,332
Well done, computer.

297
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:31,065
Computer,
run standard code translations

298
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:32,231
on probe data.

299
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:33,900
lsolate syntax results.

300
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,272
Processing.

301
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,776
Stand by.

302
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:41,574
Come in.

303
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:42,741
Yes, Odo.

304
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:44,580
Commander...

305
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:45,915
l have a problem.

306
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:46,920
Quark again?

307
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,251
No, sir.

308
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:50,314
This one is named Lwaxana.

309
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:52,189
Lwaxana Troi, the ambassador?

310
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,591
That's her.

311
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,824
There was a minor incident
at the bar

312
00:14:56,864 --> 00:15:00,027
that l helped her with,
and now she's...

313
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,364
grateful.

314
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,029
What's the problem?

315
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,336
The manner in which she
expresses her gratitude.

316
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,673
To be honest,
Commander, she seems...

317
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,736
interested in me.

318
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:17,046
What's wrong with that?

319
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:19,745
She's extremely aggressive.

320
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:22,278
l see.
So she's after you.

321
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:25,451
Like a Wanoni tracehound.

322
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:27,552
Have you thought
of letting her catch you?

323
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,563
Sir?

324
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:32,157
A little romance, Odo.

325
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,192
l have six pylons that need
a complete security sweep.

326
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:39,673
l don't have time
for romantic interludes.

327
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,637
Frankly, in my humble opinion,
most of you humanoids

328
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,204
spend far too much time

329
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:50,683
on your
respective mating rituals.

330
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:53,084
lt does help the procreation
of one's species.

331
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:57,921
Procreation does not require
changing how you smell

332
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,621
or writing bad poetry,
or sacrificing various plants

333
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:04,290
to serve as tokens of affection.

334
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:08,631
ln any event,
it's all irrelevant to me.

335
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,364
l'm sorry to hear that.

336
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:12,338
l would appreciate it
if you would

337
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:14,034
do something about this woman.

338
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,438
Me?

339
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,740
Just tell her to leave me alone.

340
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,040
Constable, you can handle

341
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:22,571
thieves and killers,
but not one Betazoid woman?

342
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:25,676
l understand
thieves and killers.

343
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,210
l don't understand... her.

344
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,246
l can't help you, Odo.

345
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,885
l'm just trying to avoid
a diplomatic incident.

346
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:35,259
l don't want
to insult the Ambassador.

347
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:36,695
A reasonable concern.

348
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,359
l suggest you handle the matter
with great delicacy.

349
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:49,638
l don't handle ''delicacy''
very well.

350
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:54,604
The probe appears to be made

351
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,639
out of some sort
of corundium alloy.

352
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:01,747
Analysis of all subprocessor
modules is complete.

353
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,518
Already?

354
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:04,888
On screen.

355
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,091
Lieutenant?

356
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,632
No science modules

357
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,464
no communications system

358
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:18,131
and enough computer
capacity to run

359
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:19,833
a Galaxy-class starship.

360
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:20,841
lt's very odd.

361
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,604
That's an awful lot
of computer hardware

362
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:24,042
simply to navigate a probe.

363
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:25,407
Anything?

364
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:28,677
Nothing to suggest
the probe's mission...

365
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:31,241
or any hint of its origin.

366
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,987
Ah! There you are, Odo!

367
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:43,430
Have you ever been

368
00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:45,455
on the fourth moon
of Andevian ll at dawn?

369
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:46,966
Can't say l have.

370
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:48,901
l have the most
wonderful holoprogram.

371
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:50,563
And l've reserved
a suite for us

372
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:51,798
with that Quark person.

373
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,002
You told Quark that you were
going into a holosuite with me?

374
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,031
Well, of course.

375
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,271
He's preparing a special
picnic basket for us.

376
00:17:58,312 --> 00:17:59,438
Good Lord.

377
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,970
l'm afraid l'm not available.

378
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:03,313
l have to get to Upper
Pylon 3 immediately.

379
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,317
Madam Ambassador...

380
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,545
Oh, Lwaxana.

381
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,851
Um... Upper Pylon 3.

382
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:11,153
l've always wanted
to see an upper pylon.

383
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:14,954
l know-- l'll have Quark

384
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:17,691
send one of his minions
with our basket.

385
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:19,858
We'll have our picnic
up there.

386
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,162
Madam Ambassador...

387
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:22,499
Oh, Lwaxana.

388
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:23,935
l don't eat.

389
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:26,337
This is not a real mouth.

390
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,398
lt is an approximation of one.

391
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,172
l do not have an esophagus
or a stomach

392
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:32,907
or a digestive system.

393
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:34,437
l am not like you.

394
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:39,384
Every 16 hours,
l turn into a liquid.

395
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,513
l can swim.

396
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:42,544
Oh...

397
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:47,685
Computer?

398
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,127
Computer!

399
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,791
Odo to Ops.

400
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:55,597
Go ahead, Odo.

401
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:58,730
Ambassador Troi and l
are stuck in Turbolift 7.

402
00:18:58,772 --> 00:18:59,739
What's going on?

403
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:02,367
Power to the pylon
turbolifts has failed.

404
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:09,342
We're reading
a turbolift failure, Odo.

405
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:10,748
We'll beam you out.

406
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:11,751
Locking on.

407
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:13,013
Prepare to transport.

408
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,213
Ready.

409
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:15,882
Energizing.

410
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:22,959
Well?

411
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:25,488
Looks like the transporter
is down, too.

412
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,295
But don't worry, Constable.

413
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,495
We'll get it repaired
right away.

414
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:30,935
Dax to Chief O'Brien.

415
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:33,030
Please report
to Ops immediately.

416
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,334
Be patient, Odo.

417
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,900
We'll get you out of there
as soon as we can.

418
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,242
Well, alone at last.

419
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:00,259
Electromotive coil functions,
normal.

420
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:02,595
Load detection functions,
normal.

421
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:04,294
Diagnostic complete.

422
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:05,495
l don't get it.

423
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:08,403
Every component
of the turbolift power net

424
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:10,134
seems to be operational.

425
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:13,143
We can't find anything wrong
with the transporter.

426
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:15,042
Great, everything's
in working order

427
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,477
except nothing's working.

428
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:19,141
How do we get our people
out of the turbolift, Chief?

429
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:21,743
Well, if we were on a starship,
l'd reroute the EPS power flow

430
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,650
in a couple of hours,
but, with this computer

431
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:25,314
there's no telling
how long it'll take.

432
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:26,755
Get it started.

433
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:29,983
Kira to Odo.

434
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:31,016
Yes, Major?

435
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:32,187
l'm sorry, but you're going

436
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:33,890
to have to stay put
for a while longer.

437
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:35,899
Define ''a while.''

438
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,833
l wish l knew.

439
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:41,736
By the way,
Cardassian turbolifts

440
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:44,002
run exposed, multi-phased
alternating currents

441
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,633
through their
positioning mechanisms

442
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:47,803
so don't try to shape-shift
your way out.

443
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:51,042
l wouldn't think of it.

444
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:54,517
Besides, it wouldn't be polite.

445
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:56,212
l didn't hear that.

446
00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:59,789
lt wouldn't be polite.

447
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:01,381
Understood.

448
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,222
Kira out.

449
00:21:05,996 --> 00:21:08,464
Do you suppose that we're, uh...

450
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:10,967
we're actually in any danger?

451
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:13,128
Not if we remain calm.

452
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,467
Ah.

453
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:18,464
Well, then we might as well
enjoy ourselves.

454
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:22,343
Uh, we can take the opportunity
to get to know each other.

455
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:26,543
l'd really prefer
to pass the time quietly.

456
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,551
-Quietly.
-Quietly.

457
00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:29,552
Of course.

458
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:30,553
Thank you.

459
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:31,576
Mmm.

460
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:39,996
The quiet man.

461
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,328
Hmm.

462
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:45,699
You know, l've always been
attracted to quiet men.

463
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:47,727
Odd, isn't it?

464
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:48,931
But maybe there's

465
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:53,773
more truth than we realize
to that old axiom that op...

466
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,470
Quietly.

467
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:09,118
Odo.

468
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:12,461
Yes?

469
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:14,987
l don't think l can.

470
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,432
Can what?

471
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:21,461
Well, you don't have
to say another word

472
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:23,473
as long as we're here

473
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:27,341
but l, l think
l really need to talk.

474
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:32,672
l understand.

475
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:40,046
There's nothing to be afraid of.

476
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:41,784
Of course not.

477
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:44,055
No, things could be much worse.

478
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,651
Really?

479
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:49,962
My daughter and l
were once trapped

480
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,969
aboard a Ferengi cargo ship,
and it was dreadful.

481
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:55,904
Well, all right,
it wasn't actually dreadful.

482
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:57,907
lt was mildly lamentable

483
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:00,933
and it was all because
of that loathsome DaiMon.

484
00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:02,206
Well...

485
00:23:02,246 --> 00:23:04,646
actually, he wasn't
altogether loathsome.

486
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:07,775
He was just slightly repulsive.

487
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:11,777
But he did have
a certain charm...

488
00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:15,417
in an insufferable kind of way.

489
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,927
Of course, he was
totally at the mercy

490
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,429
of his uncontrollable
passion for me

491
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:23,922
which means he wasn't
all bad, now, doesn't it?

492
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:26,435
And you know, it wasn't
all passion, no.

493
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,338
There was some negligible
commercial interest involved

494
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:32,774
but, oh, the passion--

495
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,938
oh, that was...
that was perfectly real

496
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:39,471
and kind of, um,
kind of sweet in a way.

497
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:41,882
He was so helpless.

498
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,286
At first, it was totally
a question of expediency

499
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:47,620
when l made love with him.

500
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:50,183
What are you looking at?

501
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:52,525
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

502
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:53,689
Oh.

503
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,755
Uh, nothing.

504
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,701
l was just wondering
how many volts

505
00:23:59,736 --> 00:24:01,260
are in that exposed circuit.

506
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:02,932
Go on. Go on.

507
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:05,305
Well... frankly

508
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:07,173
by the time one thing
led to another...

509
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:11,647
Think of it
as an opportunity, Doctor.

510
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:13,411
You never know
when a friendly ambassador

511
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,849
is going to be
in the right place

512
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:16,512
at the right time
to help your career.

513
00:24:16,553 --> 00:24:19,579
Another hour with them
could destroy my career.

514
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:20,954
lt's a simple job.

515
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:23,357
Just keep them happy
and away from me.

516
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:24,519
Simple?

517
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:26,552
Nothing makes them happy.

518
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:28,963
They are dedicated
to being unhappy

519
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:31,399
and to spreading that
unhappiness wherever they go.

520
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:34,529
They are the Ambassadors
of Unhappy.

521
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:37,833
All of us have had
these assignments, Doctor.

522
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:38,842
Have you, sir?

523
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:39,934
As a matter of fact

524
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:42,036
Curzon Dax
used to take perverse pleasure

525
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:44,342
in assigning me
to take care of VlP guests.

526
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:47,509
Oh, so now you take
the same perverse pleasure

527
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:48,950
in doing it to me.

528
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:50,510
Exactly.

529
00:24:50,554 --> 00:24:52,021
May l ask, sir

530
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:55,650
when you graduated
from this sort of assignment?

531
00:24:57,628 --> 00:25:00,620
The day l hit one of the guests.

532
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:02,097
Hit one...

533
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:04,430
lt was a simple misunderstanding

534
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:07,437
over his attempt
to coax a young Ensign

535
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:10,269
to his quarters
against her will.

536
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:12,673
But...

537
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:15,610
don't hit one of them,
Doctor.

538
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:18,877
l'm not nearly as understanding
as Curzon was.

539
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,146
Yes, sir.

540
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:24,347
Commander, can l talk to you?

541
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:28,391
lt's about the computer, sir.

542
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:30,017
Still giving you problems?

543
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,028
No, sir, that's just the thing,
it's not.

544
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:34,757
lt rerouted the EPS power flow
in less than an hour.

545
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:36,026
That's good news.

546
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:38,363
How soon can we get Odo
and the Ambassador out?

547
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:39,391
We can't.

548
00:25:39,436 --> 00:25:41,199
lt didn't activate
the turbolift circuits.

549
00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:42,603
Don't ask me why.

550
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:44,539
You must have some idea
of what's wrong.

551
00:25:44,574 --> 00:25:48,567
l want you to listen
to something.

552
00:25:48,612 --> 00:25:53,174
Computer, analyze Ops
0-2 sensor readings.

553
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:59,985
All sensors read
between 14.3 and 14.4 KSC.

554
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,519
Computer, restart all shield
generator subsystems.

555
00:26:07,564 --> 00:26:10,965
Shield generator subsystems
set to active status.

556
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,868
Reading 98.3% efficiency.

557
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:15,872
Do you hear it?

558
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:18,941
Hear what?

559
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:21,604
The voice--
it's not the same attitude.

560
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:23,237
lt sounds like the computer.

561
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,147
Sir, when you work
with a computer as much as l do

562
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:27,275
you get to know it.

563
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:29,012
They're all very different.

564
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,984
Working with
the <i>Enterprise</i> computer

565
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:32,386
was like dancing a waltz.

566
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:35,186
With this computer, it's always
been like a wrestling match--

567
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:37,489
till we started
downloading the probe.

568
00:26:37,527 --> 00:26:39,586
You think some kind
of program from the probe

569
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:41,256
is influencing our computer?

570
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:44,267
Well, it's got to be more
than just a program, sir.

571
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:46,929
The computer's whole personality
has changed.

572
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,165
lt's not resisting any commands

573
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:52,232
offering any opinions,
giving any arguments

574
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:55,039
and there's this
one other crazy thing

575
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:57,410
l'm almost afraid to mention.

576
00:26:57,447 --> 00:26:58,573
What's that?

577
00:26:58,615 --> 00:26:59,946
Every time l leave

578
00:26:59,983 --> 00:27:01,951
something happens
to bring me back.

579
00:27:01,985 --> 00:27:03,282
Bring you back?

580
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,447
To the computer--
like the failures

581
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:07,821
to the turbolifts
and the transporters.

582
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:10,156
A few minutes ago, l was working
at the transporter pad

583
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:12,320
and the com lines went down

584
00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:14,660
and when l broke
for a quick bite to eat

585
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:16,666
we had a replicator failure.

586
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,463
lt's almost like the computer

587
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:20,561
doesn't want me
to leave it alone.

588
00:27:20,604 --> 00:27:23,573
You almost make it sound
like a child.

589
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,150
Station Log, supplemental.

590
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:38,817
Odo and Ambassador Troi
remain trapped in Turbolift 4.

591
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:41,759
As of yet, we have been unable
to ascertain what it is

592
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:44,786
that's causing the station's
computer to malfunction.

593
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,629
What if it's some kind
of nonbiological life-form

594
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,100
we've never seen before?

595
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:51,262
Nonbiological?

596
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:54,364
Well, it all comes down
to how we define life-form.

597
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:58,366
But just as biological organisms
have evolved in our cultures

598
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:00,902
mechanical life could have
done the same in others.

599
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:04,849
You're suggesting someone
left a baby at our doorstep.

600
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:06,351
Possibly.

601
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:08,081
Do you think we can
communicate with it?

602
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,850
Well, in a way, we already have.

603
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:12,255
l mean, it's part and parcel
of our computer now.

604
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,452
But as far as direct
communication is concerned

605
00:28:14,494 --> 00:28:15,893
it may not be capable of that.

606
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,658
We haven't seen any evidence
that this entity is sentient.

607
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,256
Maybe more like a stray puppy

608
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,096
that's attached itself
to you, Chief.

609
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:24,626
Whatever it is, it's slowly
disabling our station.

610
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,695
People, we've got
to get it out of there.

611
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:29,970
lt came here when we downloaded
the probe's files.

612
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:33,274
lf we upload those same files
back to the probe

613
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,973
it might go with them.

614
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,675
What if it's fully integrated
itself into our computer?

615
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:39,309
l don't think it has.

616
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:41,183
That would make it
more like a virus.

617
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,280
But l don't see any evidence
that it's trying to overwrite

618
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:46,655
our control networks
or destroy our systems.

619
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,489
l think it's more
likely that it simply

620
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:49,495
creates connections

621
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:51,554
with areas of the computer
that are active.

622
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,462
Almost as though it
feeds off the energy

623
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:54,830
of the computer functions.

624
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:57,768
lf l'm right, transferring
all of its programming

625
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:00,602
off the station might
just solve our problems.

626
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,938
How long since we had
any communication from Odo?

627
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:10,608
Com lines have been
down over 90 minutes.

628
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,948
He's been in there
almost four hours now.

629
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,953
Do you happen to know
the schedule

630
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,545
of his regenerative cycle?

631
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,557
My God, l have no idea

632
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,890
but if he doesn't get back
to his pail in time...

633
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:32,336
Subspace emitter aligned.

634
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,965
Outgoing data stream activated.

635
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:38,704
Computer, upload
all probe command sequences

636
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,712
back to probe's computer.

637
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,907
Stand by.

638
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,179
Unable to complete
requested function.

639
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:48,187
Please abort and retry.

640
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:50,348
Reset subspace emitter.

641
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:53,358
Reinitialize data stream.

642
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,360
Receptors open.

643
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:58,989
Control relays activated.

644
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,795
Upload all probe
command sequences

645
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,893
back to probe's computers.

646
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,904
Stand by.

647
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:14,445
lt's not as easy as l thought
it would be, Commander.

648
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,642
ls it just the lights
or the heat, too?

649
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,811
l didn't bring any warm clothes.

650
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:23,117
l'm sure it's just temporary.

651
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,020
l've been reading the reports

652
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:27,524
of your Chief of Operations,
Doctor.

653
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,323
They gave me the impression

654
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:31,489
that he was
a competent engineer.

655
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:33,021
Chief O'Brien?

656
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,396
One of the best in Starfleet.

657
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,833
Then why aren't
the backup systems functioning?

658
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:38,336
Well, you know

659
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:40,532
out here on the edge
of the frontier

660
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:43,701
it's just one adventure
after another.

661
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:46,678
Why don't l escort you all
back to your quarters?

662
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:50,079
Where l'm sure we can
all wait this one out.

663
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,820
But enough about me.

664
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:05,694
Hmm?

665
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,358
Enough about me.

666
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,699
Tell me about yourself.

667
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:13,227
l'm really a private man.

668
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:17,239
Yes, of course you are.

669
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,070
ls that hair real?

670
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:27,481
lt is real in that it is me.

671
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,351
lt is not real hair.

672
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,620
How did you do it?

673
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,888
Your hair.

674
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,327
lt took a great deal
of practice.

675
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:40,196
You studied hairstyles?

676
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:45,495
lf you must know

677
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:47,506
l imitated the hairstyle

678
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,509
of the Bajoran man
who was assigned to me.

679
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:52,841
Assigned?

680
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,847
To study me
at the research center.

681
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:58,145
He was a scientist.

682
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:01,745
You mean that's how you grew up

683
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:04,221
in a laboratory?

684
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,986
l did not grow up

685
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:09,357
as you think of it.

686
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:13,593
lt was merely a transition
from what l used to be

687
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:15,601
to what l learned to become.

688
00:32:15,635 --> 00:32:17,330
Oh.

689
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,134
lt sounds very lonely to me.

690
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,007
l was always
very self-sufficient.

691
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,879
l'm sure you had to be...

692
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:33,714
uh, to survive

693
00:32:33,753 --> 00:32:37,382
being... being so different
from everyone else.

694
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:45,286
Odo to Ops.
Odo to Ops.

695
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:47,299
Com lines are still down.

696
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,631
l don't know
what's taking so long.

697
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:51,569
Are you sure you're all right?

698
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:52,901
You look warm.

699
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:56,339
lt's nothing.
l'm fine.

700
00:32:56,375 --> 00:33:00,334
Oh, l can't imagine
how it must have been.

701
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:04,145
You know, if it bothers
you to talk about this...

702
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:07,311
Not at all.

703
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,321
What was it like?

704
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:13,314
l guess you could say
l was the life of the party.

705
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,327
l don't think l understand.

706
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,659
My way of trying to fit in...

707
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:20,689
l found l could be entertaining.

708
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,394
''Odo, be a chair.''

709
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:23,527
l'm a chair.

710
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:24,536
''Odo, be a razorcat.''

711
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,537
l'm a razorcat.

712
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,095
Life of the party.

713
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:32,007
l hate parties.

714
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:37,939
Perhaps you've been going
to the wrong ones.

715
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,814
Come to one of mine, Odo.

716
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,013
l'll make sure
that all the guests

717
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:44,522
are there to entertain you.

718
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:51,829
Now, now, you're not well.

719
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,593
No, it's fine.

720
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,623
lt's just a...

721
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:01,867
l told you l turn
into a liquid every 16 hours.

722
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:07,006
Well, l'm in hour 15.

723
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:17,482
Ready, Commander.

724
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,457
How long do you
expect it to take?

725
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:20,550
Well, if it works

726
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:22,823
we ought to be able to get
all the probe's files

727
00:34:22,862 --> 00:34:24,989
manually transferred
to the six isolinear rods

728
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,156
in less than 60 seconds.

729
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,324
Let's do it.

730
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:30,767
Computer, run
a level-1 diagnostic

731
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,634
of all power systems on board.

732
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,401
Requested function
will require 43 minutes.

733
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:36,608
Stand by.

734
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,278
Computer, give me an analysis

735
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,974
of all Cardassian traffic
along the border.

736
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,276
Processing long-range sensors.

737
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,477
Stand by.

738
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,983
Computer,
create a historical data base

739
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,558
for all known wormhole activity.

740
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,219
lndicate time parameters.

741
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,990
All known occurrences.

742
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:02,728
Requested function
will require subspace link-up.

743
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:07,261
ln that case, create a subspace
link with Nehru Colony

744
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:12,368
New France Colony
and Corado l Transmitter Array.

745
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,470
Attempting link-up.

746
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,107
Stand by...

747
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,949
Computer, access musical files
in the Bajor Master Data Banks

748
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,851
and create a concert program
of Bajoran serenas.

749
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:28,347
Stand... by....

750
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:31,760
Unable to...

751
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,256
Stand...

752
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,704
l'm reading a huge plasma surge
in the Habitat Ring.

753
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,899
You tell Commander Sisko that l
expect that probe briefing

754
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,910
to be held on schedule,
lights or no lights.

755
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,571
l will surely pass
that on, Ambassador.

756
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,943
We've got a plasma explosion

757
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,952
in corridor H-12-A,
guest quarters.

758
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,613
The computer's not responding.

759
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,952
None of the fire suppression
systems are coming on line.

760
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,753
l'm reading four life-forms
in that corridor.

761
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:01,759
Major, you're with me.

762
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,317
Chief, get an emergency crew
down there.

763
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,453
We'll need manual fire gear.

764
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,485
Aye, sir.

765
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,225
Phasers at maximum.

766
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,472
Toranium inlay,
Cardassian design--

767
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,670
l should have guessed.

768
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,611
We're going to need a bipolar
torch to get through it.

769
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:56,739
Then get a message to Ops.

770
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,976
Tell them it's going to take us
a while to get inside.

771
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,280
lf they can't get the fire
suppression systems on line

772
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,911
we're going to lose
our people in there.

773
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,010
Aye, sir.

774
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,924
lt's not paying
any attention to me.

775
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,258
l guess it just
doesn't want to leave--

776
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,594
like a scared puppy.

777
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,429
We have no idea how long
that probe was tumbling

778
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,332
through space-- maybe years--

779
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,701
with that life-form
alone on board.

780
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,832
lt's sort of like shutting up
a puppy in a room, you know?

781
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,934
l had a pup once.

782
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,272
lf l had to lock him up

783
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,940
he'd scratch forever at the door
trying to get out.

784
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,778
l'm not sure l know
what you're getting at.

785
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,944
Pups don't like
to be left alone.

786
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,283
They like attention.

787
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:38,915
This one is certainly
getting a lot of it.

788
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,151
That's right.

789
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,955
So it's no wonder
it doesn't want to leave.

790
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,587
Okay, but how is that
going to help us?

791
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,655
Everything we've seen suggests

792
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,827
that this entity likes
to be where the action is.

793
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,462
lt seems to feed off the energy
of an active computer.

794
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,940
We've been trying to separate it
from what it thrives on.

795
00:37:56,975 --> 00:38:00,103
We've got to do
the exact opposite.

796
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,441
The exact opposite?

797
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,812
Lieutenant, l've got
to build a doghouse.

798
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,351
Odo to Ops.

799
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,167
Odo out.

800
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,932
Odo, turn around.

801
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,938
l can't.

802
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,031
lt's beginning.

803
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,043
lt's all right.

804
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,204
You don't understand.

805
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:39,114
No one has ever seen me
like this before.

806
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,813
Not even the scientist
who was assigned to you?

807
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,481
That was different.

808
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:47,491
lt was only research to him.

809
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:51,461
But you don't have
to be ashamed with me.

810
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,191
l'm not ashamed.

811
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:58,498
lt's a private matter,
that's all.

812
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:02,028
How can l make it easier
for you?

813
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,200
You can't.

814
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:06,233
l'm fine.

815
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,653
What's that?

816
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,678
My hair.

817
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:30,226
No one's ever seen me like this.

818
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:32,634
Why?

819
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,468
lt looks fine.

820
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,176
lt looks ordinary.

821
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,668
l've never cared to be ordinary.

822
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:46,343
So you see, Odo,
even we non-shape-shifters

823
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,547
have to change who we are
once in a while.

824
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,415
You are not at all
what l expected.

825
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,059
No one's ever paid me
a greater compliment.

826
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:15,277
l... cannot hold my shape
any longer.

827
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,306
Let go.

828
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,250
l'll take care of you.

829
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:34,533
We're going to need
portable oxygen

830
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:35,538
and get anything

831
00:40:35,572 --> 00:40:37,631
Bashir has in stock
to treat plasma burns.

832
00:40:37,674 --> 00:40:38,698
Have a runabout ready

833
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:41,142
to evacuate these people
to Bajor if we need to.

834
00:40:41,178 --> 00:40:42,167
Yes, sir.

835
00:40:45,382 --> 00:40:46,849
Anara?

836
00:40:46,884 --> 00:40:49,785
The subprogram is ready, Chief.

837
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,347
Computer, analyze subprogram
labeled ''Pup.''

838
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:57,952
Requested subprogram is a series
of bidirectional data transfer

839
00:40:57,995 --> 00:40:59,758
and monitoring commands.

840
00:40:59,797 --> 00:41:02,766
Reroute all main computer
backup functions

841
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,631
through this subprogram.

842
00:41:04,668 --> 00:41:07,136
All backup functions rerouted.

843
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:08,729
Great.

844
00:41:08,772 --> 00:41:10,399
Okay, computer.

845
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:12,068
Now, listen carefully.

846
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:15,408
l want to transfer
all probe command sequences

847
00:41:15,446 --> 00:41:18,938
out of core memory
and into the subprogram, Pup.

848
00:41:18,982 --> 00:41:20,313
Stand by.

849
00:41:22,352 --> 00:41:24,343
Transfer complete.

850
00:41:26,056 --> 00:41:27,353
Dax to Sisko.

851
00:41:27,391 --> 00:41:29,120
Fire suppression is responding.

852
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,786
All systems are back on line.

853
00:41:30,828 --> 00:41:31,817
Can you get in?

854
00:41:34,898 --> 00:41:37,560
We're in, Dax.
Stand by.

855
00:41:58,522 --> 00:42:01,514
We'd better advise
Starfleet Command.

856
00:42:07,364 --> 00:42:09,127
Are you all right?

857
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:12,101
Here, take my hand,
Madam Ambassador.

858
00:42:12,135 --> 00:42:13,762
Watch your head.

859
00:42:15,305 --> 00:42:16,670
Please, Julian.

860
00:42:16,707 --> 00:42:19,335
Call me Taxco.

861
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:21,674
Ambassador, are you all right?

862
00:42:21,712 --> 00:42:24,044
Yes. Thanks to Julian.

863
00:42:27,551 --> 00:42:30,850
The Doctor was remarkably
calm and logical

864
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:34,619
for a man of his years
under such severe conditions.

865
00:42:34,658 --> 00:42:37,525
We'll be putting him in
for a commendation.

866
00:42:41,565 --> 00:42:43,965
Nice work, Dr. Bashir.

867
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:47,559
Just in the right place
at the right time, sir.

868
00:42:54,011 --> 00:42:56,571
Well, it's about time.

869
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:04,310
l... know that wasn't
exactly what you had in mind

870
00:43:04,354 --> 00:43:06,515
for your picnic.

871
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:08,354
When it comes to picnics

872
00:43:08,392 --> 00:43:10,860
the only thing
that really matters

873
00:43:10,894 --> 00:43:12,191
is the company.

874
00:43:12,229 --> 00:43:17,496
Your sensitivity and discretion
are appreciated.

875
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:20,837
Well...

876
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:23,169
next time you see me

877
00:43:23,206 --> 00:43:26,198
l'll give you
a lot more to appreciate.

878
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:40,949
How did you beat that thing
in the computer, Chief?

879
00:43:40,991 --> 00:43:41,958
l didn't.

880
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:43,458
He adopted it.

881
00:43:43,493 --> 00:43:44,460
Adopted it?

882
00:43:44,494 --> 00:43:45,893
Well, l was able
to get our friend

883
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:48,295
out of the main command pathways
and into a subprogram.

884
00:43:48,332 --> 00:43:50,766
You're suggesting
we leave it in there?

885
00:43:50,801 --> 00:43:51,927
l don't see why not.

886
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:54,369
lt's happy.
lt's not bothering us anymore.

887
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:56,565
Well, it seems
the humane thing to do.

888
00:43:56,607 --> 00:43:59,269
lt's just another new life-form
visiting the station.

889
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:00,606
l'll take care of it.

890
00:44:00,644 --> 00:44:03,272
Make sure it gets
enough attention and all.

891
00:44:03,313 --> 00:44:05,804
Keep it off the furniture.

892
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:07,510
Yes, sir.
