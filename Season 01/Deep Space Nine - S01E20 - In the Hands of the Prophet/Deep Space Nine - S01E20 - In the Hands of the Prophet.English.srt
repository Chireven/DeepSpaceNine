1
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:06,325
Try one.
You'll like it.

2
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:07,729
Too early for me.

3
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:08,732
You sure?

4
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:10,028
lt's so sweet.

5
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:11,897
lt's a natural sweetness

6
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:14,336
from the sap of the <i>jumja</i> tree.

7
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:16,135
lt's full of vitamin C.

8
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:19,006
Since when did you
become such an expert

9
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:20,203
on <i>jumja</i> sticks?

10
00:00:20,244 --> 00:00:21,370
Oh, Neela told me.

11
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:22,379
Did she?

12
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,380
Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:24,676
So...

14
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:27,548
she working out any better
than the last one?

15
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:28,643
Who, Neela?

16
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:29,812
She's terrific.

17
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:32,220
She's even taught me
a thing or two.

18
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,224
l'm glad to hear her expertise

19
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:36,192
doesn't end with <i>jumja</i> sticks.

20
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:38,627
No. She's a really good engi...

21
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:40,061
Hold on.

22
00:00:40,097 --> 00:00:41,359
What?

23
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,559
Well...

24
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,067
you're not thinking...?

25
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,396
Well, Keiko!

26
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:48,303
Just keeping you
on your toes, O'Brien.

27
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,068
Oh, very funny.

28
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:53,133
Be careful who you
share your <i>jumja</i> with.

29
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:08,489
Now, as we discussed
in yesterday's lesson

30
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,927
the wormhole was discovered
by Commander Sisko

31
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:14,658
and Lieutenant Dax
earlier this year.

32
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:18,600
Does anyone know what makes
this wormhole so unusual?

33
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:20,501
Jake?

34
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,698
lt's stable?

35
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:22,763
lt's stable.

36
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:24,274
That's right, Jake.

37
00:01:24,308 --> 00:01:27,243
lt's the first stable wormhole
known to exist...

38
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:31,811
Please, continue.

39
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:34,147
A stable wormhole
is very important

40
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:37,814
because it allows us to travel,
secure in the knowledge

41
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:40,483
that neither end
will shift locations.

42
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:44,961
Who knows why this wormhole
is stable?

43
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:48,260
Because it was
artificially constructed.

44
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,392
Commander Sisko
encountered the entities

45
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:52,527
who created the wormhole
when he went...

46
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,901
Excuse me.

47
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:57,396
By entities,
do you not mean the Prophets?

48
00:01:57,441 --> 00:02:00,877
Yes, on Bajor, the entities
are worshipped as Prophets.

49
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:04,574
Our studies of the wormhole
have shown that it was formed

50
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:07,516
by unique particles
we call ''verterons''

51
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:10,520
that are apparently
self-sustaining in nature.

52
00:02:10,554 --> 00:02:12,317
This begins to explain

53
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:16,850
how a ship at impulse can safely
pass through without...

54
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:18,885
Ships are safely guided
through the passage

55
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:20,829
by the hands of the Prophets.

56
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:22,833
ln a manner of speaking.

57
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:26,268
Not, apparently,
in your manner of speaking.

58
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:29,466
Perhaps we should discuss this
after class.

59
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:30,667
Do you believe

60
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,176
the Celestial Temple
of the Prophets

61
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,041
exists within the passage?

62
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,309
l respect
that the Bajoran people

63
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:38,838
believe that it does.

64
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:41,579
But that's not what you teach.

65
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,847
No.

66
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:45,720
l don't teach
Bajoran spiritual beliefs.

67
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:46,916
That's your job.

68
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,949
Mine is to open
the children's minds to...

69
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:53,657
history, to literature,
to mathematics, to science.

70
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:56,325
You are opening
the children's minds--

71
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:57,561
to blasphemy

72
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:00,195
and l cannot permit it
to continue.

73
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,439
Sorry l couldn't
get here sooner.

74
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:08,135
Another fusion reactor
went down.

75
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:09,438
How's it going?

76
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:10,466
Done.

77
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:11,843
Done?

78
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,677
Did you remember
to re-initialize

79
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:15,114
the isolinear coprocessor?

80
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,118
l did it exactly
like you showed me.

81
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:18,244
Should l test it?

82
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:19,253
Well, uh, let me.

83
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:20,686
You know us old folks.

84
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:22,212
We like to feel useful.

85
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,754
Not bad.

86
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:27,659
Not bad at all.

87
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:29,823
You keep this up,
l'll be out of a job.

88
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:32,094
l doubt that.

89
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,465
Let's close it up.

90
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:41,336
Not that one.

91
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,708
That's a security seal.

92
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:46,407
You need an EJ7 interlock
to close it.

93
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:48,075
EJ7?

94
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:50,516
Yeah. That's okay.
l have one here.

95
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:52,110
Bloody hell.

96
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:54,849
What's wrong?

97
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,619
Well, my EJ7 is missing.

98
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,786
lt was here yesterday.

99
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:02,888
Maybe you left it in Ops.

100
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:04,558
No.

101
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,089
l...

102
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:08,466
l don't misplace my tools.

103
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:10,300
l'm not exactly surprised.

104
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:12,499
You knew this was
going to happen?

105
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,737
A confrontation like this
was inevitable.

106
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:16,937
Sometimes l wonder

107
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:20,139
if we'll ever find
the common ground we need

108
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:23,241
to bring Bajor
into the Federation.

109
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:25,411
Major, would you join us?

110
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,254
We've been talking
about an incident

111
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,484
this morning at school.

112
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:31,549
l heard.

113
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:32,821
Vedek Winn's been meeting

114
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:35,056
with some of the Bajoran
civilians about it.

115
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,563
What do you know about her?

116
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:38,429
She's from an orthodox order.

117
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:41,458
She has some support
to become the next Kai...

118
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:42,834
probably not enough.

119
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:44,930
The question is,
how much support

120
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:46,907
does she have on this station?

121
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:48,135
She has mine.

122
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:50,337
You can't possibly believe

123
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:52,642
teaching the facts
about the wormhole

124
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,977
amounts to blasphemy.

125
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:55,983
l think some revisions
in the school curriculum

126
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:57,314
might be appropriate.

127
00:06:57,352 --> 00:06:59,786
You teach a lot
of Bajoran children.

128
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:02,790
l'm not going to let
a Bajoran spiritual leader

129
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:05,019
dictate what can
or can't be taught

130
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,254
in my classroom.

131
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:09,263
Then maybe we need
two schools on this station--

132
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:11,026
one for the Bajoran children

133
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:13,034
and another for the Federation.

134
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:16,299
lf we start separating Bajoran
and Federation interests...

135
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,271
A lot of Bajoran and
Federation interests

136
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:19,534
are separate, Commander.

137
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:21,439
l've been telling
you that all along.

138
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,068
Nobody's saying
that there can't be

139
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,942
spiritual teaching
on the station, Major

140
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:26,310
but can't it be in addition

141
00:07:26,347 --> 00:07:29,043
to what's taught
in Mrs. O'Brien's classroom?

142
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:30,449
But if she's teaching

143
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:32,953
a fundamentally
different philosophy...

144
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:35,046
l'm not teaching any philosophy.

145
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,251
What l'm trying to teach
is pure science.

146
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,953
Some might say pure science

147
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:41,188
taught
without a spiritual context

148
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:42,958
is a philosophy, Mrs. O'Brien.

149
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:44,555
My philosophy is

150
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,762
that there is room for all
philosophies on this station.

151
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,532
Now, how do you suggest
that we deal with this?

152
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,799
l'm not sure you can.

153
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:17,891
l can't tell you

154
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:21,163
how much l've looked forward
to this moment.

155
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:27,467
l'm honored to meet
the Emissary to the Prophets.

156
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,807
lf you'd let me know you
were coming, Vedek Winn

157
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,368
l would have greeted you sooner.

158
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:35,041
l did not wish to bother you
with my insignificant visit.

159
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,745
l'd hardly call it
insignificant.

160
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,776
Thank you, Emissary.

161
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:41,948
l wish you wouldn't
call me that.

162
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,854
l'm Commander Sisko

163
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:45,655
or Benjamin, if you like.

164
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,957
But you are the Emissary.

165
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,293
Don't you know
the cherished place

166
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:53,494
you have earned
in the Bajoran spiritual life?

167
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:55,969
l'm not sure l'm comfortable
in that role.

168
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,699
The course the Prophets
choose for us

169
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:02,869
may not always be comfortable

170
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:06,574
but we must follow it.

171
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,411
May l?

172
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:18,119
Still the disbeliever.

173
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,491
l once asked Kai Opaka

174
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:23,929
why a disbeliever was destined
to seek the Prophets

175
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:27,729
and she told me that one
must never look into the eyes

176
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,634
of one's own gods.

177
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:32,504
l disagreed.

178
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,910
l told her l would do anything
to look into their eyes.

179
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:41,404
She suggested that l
sit in darkness for a day

180
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:44,077
and quite properly so.

181
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:47,815
She cannot be replaced,
and l miss her deeply.

182
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,720
lt's important to me
that we resolve

183
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,349
your problems with the school.

184
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:56,659
The Prophets have spoken to me
through the Orbs, Emissary.

185
00:09:56,698 --> 00:10:00,964
l understand my duty
to defend the Bajoran faith.

186
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:05,938
The teacher has dishonored
the Celestial Temple.

187
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:08,135
lf she does not recant

188
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:11,805
l cannot be responsible
for the consequences.

189
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:22,900
This still seems like an awful
lot of trouble to go through

190
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:24,063
to find one tool.

191
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:26,096
With that interlock,
someone could access

192
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:28,575
every critical system
on the station.

193
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,238
Chief, have you seen
Ensign Aquino recently?

194
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,712
No, now that you mention it.

195
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:34,715
He didn't report for duty
this morning.

196
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:36,808
The computer says
he's not on the station

197
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:37,943
but he didn't log out.

198
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:39,850
Have you talked to Odo?

199
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:41,617
l guess l'd better.

200
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:43,214
Scanners are ready.

201
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:45,192
Computer, show location

202
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:48,252
of any independent
tritanium sources.

203
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:50,491
Level 3, Section 5.

204
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:52,124
Oh, that's the tool locker.

205
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:55,193
l've been through everything
in there three times.

206
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,833
What's that?

207
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:01,364
Looks like something
in a power conduit

208
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:03,104
on Level 12, Section 8.

209
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:06,079
What would tritanium
be doing there?

210
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:08,844
Computer, shut down
that conduit.

211
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:10,544
Reroute power flow.

212
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:12,280
Conduit deactivated.

213
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,480
Come on.

214
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,015
Over here, Chief.

215
00:11:23,665 --> 00:11:26,156
That's tritanium
composite, all right.

216
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:28,396
Looks like our
missing interlock.

217
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:31,837
Must have been melted
by the conduit's plasma flow.

218
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:33,170
That still doesn't explain

219
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,971
how it got here
in the first place.

220
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:37,944
Hey...

221
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:42,040
l'm picking up traces
of organic material.

222
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,883
Whatever it was,
it's been pretty well cooked.

223
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,751
Let's take a sample
to Dr. Bashir.

224
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,313
See what he can make of it.

225
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:01,633
Ensign Aquino made a log entry
the night he disappeared

226
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:05,298
about some sort of plasma flow
irregularity in the conduit.

227
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,570
He indicated
he was going to fix it.

228
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:08,837
So, it was an accident.

229
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:10,242
Well, l guess so.

230
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:13,679
Bashir has confirmed
that the remains were human.

231
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:15,512
l'm sure the DNA trace

232
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,519
will confirm that it was Aquino.

233
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:20,350
l'll have one, please...

234
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:22,913
unless you're feeling
adventurous today.

235
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:23,923
Sorry.

236
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,516
We're all out.

237
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,720
What?

238
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:28,422
What are all these?

239
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:31,091
These aren't for sale.

240
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:32,224
Not for sale, huh?

241
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,428
How would you like
a <i>jumja</i> stick up...?

242
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:35,527
Miles.

243
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,662
ls there a problem?

244
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:37,671
Damn right there is!

245
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:38,831
l don't have to sell

246
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:41,706
anything to them
if l don't want to.

247
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:44,769
Why wouldn't you want
to sell to them?

248
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:46,245
Miles, can we go?

249
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:49,177
Let's go.

250
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:50,275
Seek the Prophets.

251
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:51,307
l'll seek you...

252
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:52,683
Miles!

253
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,848
Seek them yourself.

254
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,117
Maybe you were right.

255
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,060
Maybe we've no business here.

256
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:03,256
l'll put in for a transfer,
and that'll...

257
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:05,095
No, l can't run away
from this now.

258
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,600
...don't you all agree?

259
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:08,465
What's this?

260
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:12,337
lf we abandon the Prophets
then everything we have...

261
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:16,468
Here's Mrs. O'Brien now.

262
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:17,773
Good morning.

263
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:19,837
Are you Mr. O'Brien?

264
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:21,178
That's right.

265
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:22,739
A pleasure to meet you.

266
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:24,251
l've just been hearing

267
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:26,685
many wonderful things
about your wife

268
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:29,019
from the parents
of these children.

269
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:31,617
She apparently is
an excellent teacher.

270
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:32,921
Yes, she is

271
00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:36,087
and she doesn't deserve
what you're doing to her.

272
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,791
l feel your anger toward me

273
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:40,164
and l forgive you for it.

274
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:42,362
Mrs. O'Brien

275
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:46,271
if l've misjudged you,
l am terribly sorry.

276
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:47,797
Have l?

277
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:51,938
ls there a place in your school
for the Prophets?

278
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,948
No.

279
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:55,040
l admire you

280
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,711
for standing by your convictions

281
00:13:57,752 --> 00:14:00,380
even though l disagree
with them.

282
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:03,515
Please believe me,
l want to find a way

283
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:07,392
to allow these children
to stay in your school.

284
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:09,692
l'm sure the children
and their parents

285
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:11,596
are happy to hear you say that.

286
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:15,625
Let me be the one
to make the first concession.

287
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,729
l will no longer request

288
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:22,141
that you teach anything
about the Celestial Temple.

289
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:25,839
Just don't teach anything
about the wormhole at all.

290
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,904
lgnore it?

291
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:28,175
Find other ways

292
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:30,912
other things
to teach the children.

293
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,545
And when we get
to theories of evolution

294
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:36,182
or creation of the universe--
what then?

295
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:39,591
We'll face those issues
when we come to them.

296
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:40,685
l'm a teacher.

297
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:42,093
My responsibility

298
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,065
is to expose my students
to knowledge

299
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:46,896
not hide it from them.

300
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:48,367
The answer is no.

301
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:53,272
l've tried to be reasonable.

302
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:24,554
lf Aquino turned off the conduit

303
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:27,220
to fix the relay,
why did it reactivate?

304
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:30,060
The Cardassians only equipped
those power conduits

305
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:31,998
with one flow regulator
per level.

306
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,399
The computer
could have realigned it.

307
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:36,836
When the power flow
was rerouted back

308
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:38,862
it could have caught him inside.

309
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:40,875
You don't sound
entirely convinced.

310
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:43,503
No, it all adds up, only...

311
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:45,206
Well, l don't know.

312
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:47,714
Spit it out, Chief.

313
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:51,048
He borrowed one of my tools
without asking.

314
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:52,246
lt was 4:00 in the morning.

315
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:53,879
Maybe he didn't want
to disturb you.

316
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:55,889
The repairs could have waited.

317
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:57,424
He was a Starfleet engineer.

318
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,893
You don't take a Chief's
tools without asking.

319
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:01,361
lt's unheard of.

320
00:16:01,396 --> 00:16:05,059
Are you suggesting it might
not have been an accident?

321
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,500
l don't know
what l'm suggesting.

322
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:09,162
l only know what l know.

323
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:10,796
He should have asked.

324
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,502
Constable, maybe you ought
to take a closer look into this.

325
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:15,702
Dismissed.

326
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:18,012
Hi.

327
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:19,513
Can l talk to you for a minute?

328
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:21,515
Sure.

329
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:24,313
l heard about what happened
at school.

330
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:26,513
Did Mrs. O'Brien
call classes off?

331
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:29,853
No, there was only me
and four other kids left

332
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:32,189
but she still kept
the school open.

333
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:35,355
She changed the lesson
to teach us about Galileo.

334
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:38,194
Did you know that he was
tried by the lnquisition

335
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:41,464
for teaching that the Earth
moved around the sun?

336
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:42,800
Tried and convicted.

337
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:44,202
His books were burned.

338
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:46,503
How could anyone be so stupid?

339
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,168
lt's easy to look back
seven centuries

340
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,733
and judge what was
right and wrong.

341
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:51,302
But the same thing
is happening now

342
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:53,871
with all this stuff
about the Celestial Temple

343
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:54,882
and the wormhole.

344
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:55,883
lt's dumb.

345
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:58,886
No, it's not.

346
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,979
You've got to realize
something, Jake.

347
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:04,185
For over 50 years, the one thing
that allowed the Bajorans

348
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:06,489
to survive
the Cardassian occupation

349
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:07,586
was their faith.

350
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:09,756
The Prophets
were their only source

351
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:11,095
of hope and courage.

352
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:12,724
But there were no Prophets.

353
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,201
They were just aliens that
you found in the wormhole.

354
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:18,330
To those aliens, the future
is no more difficult to see

355
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:19,533
than the past.

356
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:21,804
Why shouldn't they be considered
Prophets?

357
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:23,401
Are you serious?

358
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:24,502
My point is

359
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:27,071
it's a matter of interpretation.

360
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:29,845
lt may not be what you believe,
but that doesn't make it wrong.

361
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:31,976
lf you start to think that way

362
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,682
you'll be acting
just like Vedek Winn.

363
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,747
Only from the other side.

364
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,954
We can't afford
to think that way, Jake.

365
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:43,452
We'd lose everything
we've worked for here.

366
00:17:43,498 --> 00:17:46,490
You're worried, aren't you?

367
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:53,700
What are you going to do?

368
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,709
l'm not sure

369
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:59,907
but l think l've got
to find some help.

370
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:31,139
l'm sorry to keep you waiting,
Commander.

371
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:32,874
Vedek Bareil?

372
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:36,949
No need to pay tribute to me.

373
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,953
Pay tribute?

374
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:40,352
l was just...

375
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:42,982
Usually when l meet
one of Bajor's spiritual leaders

376
00:18:43,024 --> 00:18:45,515
the first thing they do
is grab my...

377
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,959
Ear?

378
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:48,656
lt's unpleasant, isn't it?

379
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:51,221
l've been far too polite
to admit it.

380
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:56,397
l was five the first time one
of the monks grabbed my ear.

381
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:57,870
He was a stern old crow

382
00:18:57,906 --> 00:19:00,374
who could virtually squeeze
the <i>pagh</i> out of you

383
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:02,035
with his thumb and forefinger.

384
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:06,410
And as a chronic misbehaver,
l was his favorite victim.

385
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,574
l swore one of my life's goals

386
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:11,642
would be to do away
with that archaic ritual.

387
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:14,382
You can count
on the Federation's support.

388
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:19,224
l hope you don't mind
if l do a little planting

389
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,488
while we talk.

390
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:25,397
All those hours of listening
to 1 12 vedeks talking at once

391
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:29,665
made me yearn for the sanctity
of my arboretum.

392
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:31,831
ls this yours?

393
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:36,310
l began my service at the
monastery as the gardener.

394
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:39,404
l had no other ambition
but to grow

395
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:43,816
the most lovely Feloran
bromeliads on the planet.

396
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,217
Unfortunately, the Prophets

397
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:49,553
did not allow me
that peaceful life.

398
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:55,491
l understand my friend,
Vedek Winn

399
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,556
has brought her blessings
to your station.

400
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,295
l was hoping you might be able

401
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:04,032
to arrange an audience
with the Assembly

402
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,199
so l could discuss our school.

403
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,639
Why me?

404
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:10,872
You are the leading candidate
to become the next Kai.

405
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:13,813
Your ideology is quite different
than Vedek Winn's.

406
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:16,908
You have been correctly
informed.

407
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:24,217
l'm sorry, Commander.

408
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:26,556
The Vedek Assembly
will not see you.

409
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:28,892
Why not?

410
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,331
Some fear you as the symbol
of a Federation

411
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:34,062
they view as godless.

412
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:38,732
Some fear you as the Emissary
who walked with the Prophets.

413
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:42,903
And some fear you
because Vedek Winn told them to.

414
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:46,744
Oh, we're all very good
at conjuring up enough fear

415
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:49,511
to justify
whatever we want to do.

416
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,247
Today, l am only a Vedek.

417
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:57,246
lf the Prophets will it,
someday l may be Kai

418
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,783
and l can be a better friend
to you then.

419
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:02,022
ln other words

420
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:05,055
being my friend now
might hurt your chances.

421
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,728
The Prophets teach us patience.

422
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,228
lt appears they also
teach you politics.

423
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:17,302
l'm sorry you made
this long trip

424
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:19,040
for nothing, Commander.

425
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,345
Please stay
and enjoy the gardens

426
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:24,749
as long as you like.

427
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,246
ls it my imagination

428
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:55,374
or are we
a little shorthanded today?

429
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,442
Three Bajoran crewmen
didn't report for duty.

430
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:00,920
They said
they weren't feeling well.

431
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:03,685
Do you think
it's contagious, Major?

432
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:05,692
lt's too early to tell.

433
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:07,353
Are your people willing

434
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:09,522
to throw away everything
we've accomplished

435
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:11,031
during the past seven months?

436
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:13,056
Everyone knows
if the Federation leaves

437
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:14,864
the Cardassians will be back.

438
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:16,164
With all due respect, Major

439
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,536
protecting your borders
is not the primary reason

440
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:22,304
the Federation is here,
and it's not why l'm here.

441
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:25,039
l'm here to build a trusting
relationship with your people

442
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:27,479
and l'd like to start feeling
that somebody...

443
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:29,005
somebody on your side

444
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,642
is giving something back
to that effort.

445
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:33,313
l think l've given you all
the support l can, short of...

446
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:34,821
lt's not enough.

447
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:38,153
l thought there was room

448
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,888
for all philosophies
on this station.

449
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:44,329
You tell
our sick Bajoran crewmen

450
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:46,026
they better get well
immediately

451
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,900
or they'll recover on the way
to their next assignment.

452
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:52,167
Yes, sir.

453
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:55,642
Commander, Dr. Bashir has found
some new evidence

454
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,610
about Ensign Aquino
that you should see.

455
00:22:57,645 --> 00:23:00,773
Sir, l've finally managed
to reconstruct the victim's DNA.

456
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:02,840
lt's definitely Aquino,
but the power flow

457
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,474
in the conduit didn't kill him.

458
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,511
You see, the plasma disruption
in his cellular membranes

459
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:10,854
indicates that he was exposed
to a directed energy discharge

460
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:13,690
before he was placed
in the conduit.

461
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:15,457
A directed energy discharge?

462
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:16,986
From a phaser?

463
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:20,228
Set to kill.

464
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:32,713
Could this murder be related
in any way

465
00:23:32,754 --> 00:23:34,745
to the tensions
over the school issue?

466
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,054
lf you're suggesting
he was killed by a Bajoran

467
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:38,855
just because he was
with the Federation...

468
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,655
The analysis proves
that he was killed

469
00:23:40,696 --> 00:23:42,323
the night
before Vedek Winn arrived.

470
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:44,161
There wasn't
any school issue yet.

471
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:46,394
Any ideas about a motive?

472
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:49,567
All right

473
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:51,868
then let's start
at the beginning.

474
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:54,806
Ensign Aquino goes
to repair a power conduit.

475
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:56,003
One moment, Commander.

476
00:23:56,044 --> 00:23:57,602
l'm not convinced of that.

477
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:58,806
But the log...

478
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,610
lt could have been altered
by our killer

479
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,048
to cover his tracks.

480
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:04,814
l've checked the turbolift
records the night of the murder.

481
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:06,821
Aquino did take a turbolift
to Level 3

482
00:24:06,855 --> 00:24:09,790
but not to the power conduit
where he was found.

483
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,383
Where did he go?

484
00:24:11,426 --> 00:24:13,189
Runabout Pad C.

485
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:14,593
A runabout?

486
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:17,291
What was he doing in a runabout
at 4:00 in the morning?

487
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:20,495
Apparently,
he was getting murdered.

488
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:29,840
Everything in the runabout
seems to be perfectly normal.

489
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:31,937
lt doesn't look
like the airlock systems

490
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,208
have been tampered with.

491
00:24:33,248 --> 00:24:34,681
Let's run a level-1 diagnostic

492
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:36,411
on the runabout's
computer interface--

493
00:24:36,451 --> 00:24:37,577
then we'll call it a day.

494
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:39,678
l already have.
Everything's normal.

495
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:46,054
l don't even know
what we're looking for.

496
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:48,255
lf something
happened around here

497
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:50,730
it's been pretty
well covered up.

498
00:24:54,903 --> 00:24:56,996
Did you know him well?

499
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,403
Aquino?

500
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,998
Oh, barely at all.

501
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,807
Just the ''welcome aboard,
if you need anything'' speech.

502
00:25:03,845 --> 00:25:05,005
You?

503
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,207
Not really.

504
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:09,217
Bajoran and Starfleet officers

505
00:25:09,251 --> 00:25:12,345
don't really socialize
that much.

506
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:15,220
How come?

507
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:16,622
l don't know.

508
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:19,821
l guess we just
keep to ourselves.

509
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:23,297
Well, you're not
like that with me.

510
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:25,629
Well, you're not
like the others.

511
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:28,500
You know.

512
00:25:28,537 --> 00:25:31,131
You don't put on any airs.

513
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:33,835
You're just...

514
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,809
nicer.

515
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:41,249
Uh, look...

516
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:43,877
l'll close up here.

517
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,585
Why don't you take off.

518
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:49,522
You sure?

519
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:50,855
Yeah.

520
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,154
Yeah, l'm sure.

521
00:25:54,296 --> 00:25:56,287
Good night.

522
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:07,066
On your toes, O'Brien.

523
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,214
You were looking for me?

524
00:26:19,254 --> 00:26:20,448
Don't tell me--

525
00:26:20,488 --> 00:26:22,752
there's a Bajoran convention
on the station

526
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:23,951
l didn't know about.

527
00:26:23,992 --> 00:26:25,152
Thanks, Odo.

528
00:26:25,193 --> 00:26:27,491
l need to call in
more dabo girls.

529
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:28,826
lt's not a convention.

530
00:26:28,864 --> 00:26:31,162
They're
from an orthodox spiritual order

531
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:33,326
coming to support
Vedek Winn's efforts

532
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:35,666
to keep the Bajoran
children out of school.

533
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:37,501
Orthodox?
ln that case

534
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:40,337
l'll need twice as many
dabo girls.

535
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:43,572
These spiritual types
love those dabo girls.

536
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:46,979
This is not what l wanted
to talk to you about.

537
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:52,385
What do you know about the
murder of Ensign Aquino?

538
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,682
You wound me.

539
00:26:53,722 --> 00:26:56,589
All these years together,
l thought you knew me.

540
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:59,116
Odo, l am not a killer.

541
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,594
No, but most
of your friends are.

542
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,963
True, and l would gladly sell
one of them to you if l could

543
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,901
but unfortunately,
none of them have taken credit

544
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:10,268
for the death
of the Starfleet officer.

545
00:27:10,305 --> 00:27:11,272
Sorry.

546
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:12,466
Odo!

547
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:15,203
Keep your ears open.

548
00:27:15,243 --> 00:27:16,540
Are you kidding?

549
00:27:16,578 --> 00:27:19,513
That's the Seventh Rule
of Acquisition.

550
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:30,381
This is
a security bypass module.

551
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,226
You found it at Runabout Pad C?

552
00:27:34,262 --> 00:27:35,627
No, that's just it.

553
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:37,029
lt wasn't at Pad C.

554
00:27:37,065 --> 00:27:39,226
That was as clean as a whistle.

555
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:42,828
Just to be safe, l ran a
diagnostic across the board.

556
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:46,102
This showed up
at Runabout Pad A.

557
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:47,506
Pad A...

558
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:50,102
Aquino never went
anywhere near Pad A.

559
00:27:50,145 --> 00:27:51,703
lt doesn't make sense.

560
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:55,978
On the contrary, it
makes perfect sense.

561
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:58,178
Ensign Aquino goes to Runabout C

562
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,380
because some sensor
shows an anomaly

563
00:28:00,422 --> 00:28:02,117
in the security net there.

564
00:28:02,157 --> 00:28:04,921
He interrupts whoever
is tampering with it

565
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,791
and is killed.

566
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,796
The killer puts the body
in the conduit

567
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,264
and instead of going
back to Pad C

568
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,463
which might be traced
with Aquino's turbolift log

569
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:18,267
he changes his plan
and moves to Pad A.

570
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:20,137
But what was the plan?

571
00:28:20,175 --> 00:28:21,665
Everything else seems normal.

572
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,338
l'd guess somebody wanted
to steal a runabout.

573
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:25,937
We're not missing one.

574
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:27,039
Huh. lt's curious.

575
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:31,141
He goes to a lot of trouble
to defeat the security net

576
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:34,178
and then doesn't
go through with...

577
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:37,256
The school!

578
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,925
Keiko!

579
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:50,998
Keiko!

580
00:28:56,077 --> 00:28:57,476
Miles!

581
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:01,349
Stand back, please!

582
00:29:01,383 --> 00:29:02,577
Clear the way!

583
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,552
What have you got?

584
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,615
l'm reading traces
of cabrodine and infernite--

585
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:22,149
common explosives,
both easily obtainable.

586
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,890
Then we're looking
at a simple, homemade bomb.

587
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,697
Where is Mrs. O'Brien?

588
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,299
Her husband took her home.

589
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,573
Was she hurt?
Was anyone hurt?

590
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,477
No.

591
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,777
The Prophets
have been kind today.

592
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,409
The Prophets had nothing to do
with what happened here today.

593
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,921
This was the work
of a disturbed and violent mind

594
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:53,049
who listened to your voice,
not the Prophet's.

595
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:55,560
ls the Emissary
holding me responsible

596
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,654
for this act of terrorism?

597
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:01,666
The Commander
of this station is.

598
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,295
May the Prophets forgive you
for abandoning them.

599
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:09,239
You claim the Prophets as
your personal constituency

600
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,741
Vedek Winn.

601
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,142
l'm not convinced
that's justified.

602
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,146
Who do you speak for?

603
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,047
An order that's barely
listened to in your Assembly.

604
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:21,052
So you come here looking
for a more receptive audience.

605
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:24,988
ls that what your friend,
Vedek Bareil, told you?

606
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,822
He's as misguided as you are.

607
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,385
No, that's not fair.

608
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,297
You are not simply misguided,
as l once thought.

609
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,463
Now l see you want nothing less
than to destroy us.

610
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,472
Destroy you?

611
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,066
You live without a soul,
Commander.

612
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:46,839
You and your Federation exist
in a universe of darkness

613
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:50,370
and you would drag us
in there with you.

614
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,977
But we will not go.

615
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:58,752
You have just made
your first mistake, Vedek.

616
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:00,782
Have l?

617
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:05,092
The Bajorans who have lived
with us on this station

618
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,998
who have worked
with us for months

619
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,765
who helped us move this station
to protect the wormhole

620
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:17,105
who joined us to explore
the Gamma Quadrant

621
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:21,511
who have begun to build
the future of Bajor with us

622
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:26,484
these people know that we are
neither the enemy nor the devil.

623
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,955
We don't always agree.

624
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,789
We have some damn good fights,
in fact

625
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:37,455
but we always come
away from them

626
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,623
with a little better
understanding

627
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:41,792
and appreciation of each other.

628
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:44,462
You won't succeed here.

629
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,630
The school will reopen.

630
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,765
And when your rhetoric gets old

631
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:52,072
the Bajoran parents
will bring their children back.

632
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,310
We'll see.

633
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,620
How is she, Chief?

634
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,121
She's pretty shaken up, sir

635
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:39,590
but she's planning
to hold classes tomorrow

636
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,788
in one of the small cargo bays,
if that's okay.

637
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,626
You tell her Jake
will be there on time.

638
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,633
lt will make her feel a lot
better to hear that, sir.

639
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,134
Anything new on Aquino?

640
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,295
Yes, sir.

641
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,794
l found a security bypass module
at Runabout Pad A.

642
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,967
lt looks like somebody
might have wanted

643
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,636
to steal a runabout.

644
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:01,339
That's probably why Aquino went
there in the first place.

645
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,577
l've put security seals
in place at all three pads

646
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,743
and l'm checking
for any other anomalies.

647
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:10,243
Benjamin, there's an incoming
transmission from Vedek Bareil

648
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,780
on board a Bajoran transport.

649
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:16,451
On screen.

650
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,928
Commander, l've decided

651
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:24,265
to accept
your gracious invitation.

652
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:25,600
lnvitation?

653
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:29,505
You did invite me
to tour your facility.

654
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,008
Yes, yes, of course, Vedek.

655
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:32,510
We'd be honored.

656
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,274
Unfortunately, we have
some damage on our Promenade.

657
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:38,283
We won't have time to clean
up before you arrive.

658
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:40,581
Yes, l heard about it.

659
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,588
Perhaps l can help you
clean it up.

660
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,920
That would be
very much appreciated.

661
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,290
lt's the least a friend can do.

662
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:51,353
l look forward
to seeing you again.

663
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,750
My dear, you should not be here.

664
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,185
Vedek, they found out
about the runabout.

665
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:19,390
l see.

666
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:23,258
l have no way to escape.

667
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:27,459
Then we must accept that
as the will of the Prophets.

668
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:32,003
But if l go through
with this now

669
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:34,801
l will be caught and executed.

670
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,702
The sacrifices the Prophets
call on us to make

671
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:46,741
are great sometimes, my dear

672
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:52,690
but the rewards they give
will last through eternity.

673
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,528
What the hell?

674
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:04,729
Computer, identify subprogram
labeled ''ANA''

675
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,237
That file is protected

676
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,239
by a personal
security access code.

677
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,740
On whose authority?

678
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,936
Chief of Operations,
Miles O'Brien.

679
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,275
Me?
l never saw this file before.

680
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:15,780
Override command.

681
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,577
Unable to comply.

682
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,084
State security code
to release protection.

683
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,087
Lieutenant, l've got to do
a manual isolation

684
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,588
of an anomalous file.

685
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,786
lt's in the security field
subsystem labeled ''ANA''

686
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,789
That file is going to be

687
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:32,254
protected by a series
of encryption sequences.

688
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,088
l'll run an adaptive program.

689
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:35,923
For once, we're lucky
we're working

690
00:35:35,962 --> 00:35:37,759
with a Cardassian computer.

691
00:35:37,797 --> 00:35:40,129
lt shouldn't have any more
than seven sequences.

692
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,134
Beginning decryption.

693
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:44,796
On-line.
Patched to subprogram ANA.

694
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:10,153
Clear the way.
Clear the way.

695
00:36:10,196 --> 00:36:11,823
Make room.

696
00:36:11,864 --> 00:36:13,957
Move along, now.

697
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,865
Clear the way.

698
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:17,562
Clear the way, now.

699
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,739
Clear the way.

700
00:36:25,845 --> 00:36:28,177
Please stand back.

701
00:36:28,214 --> 00:36:29,738
Clear the way, please.

702
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:31,077
Thank you.

703
00:36:37,356 --> 00:36:39,324
That's it.

704
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:45,888
Computer, access subprogram ANA,
Code 4100RLX.

705
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:48,399
Accessing.

706
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:50,595
ldentify commands
within the file.

707
00:36:50,636 --> 00:36:52,501
Commands are
sequential overrides

708
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:55,234
of security fields
approaching Runabout Pad A.

709
00:36:55,274 --> 00:36:56,741
The force fields.

710
00:36:56,776 --> 00:36:59,370
Display sequences on screen.

711
00:37:02,748 --> 00:37:04,215
Right to the Promenade.

712
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,710
Computer, run a level-3
sensor sweep of the Promenade.

713
00:37:08,754 --> 00:37:10,551
Report any anomalous reading.

714
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:12,557
Working.

715
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:14,058
An escape route.

716
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:16,061
Escape from what?

717
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:17,562
You got me.

718
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:19,564
One anomalous reading detected.

719
00:37:19,598 --> 00:37:21,088
ldentify.

720
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:24,569
A subspace relay was activated
in the security office

721
00:37:24,603 --> 00:37:26,571
nine minutes, seven seconds ago.

722
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:28,573
Activated to do what?

723
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:30,404
Unknown.
lnsufficient data.

724
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:31,910
l'm going down there.

725
00:37:31,944 --> 00:37:34,412
l'll run a diagnostic
on the other security systems

726
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:36,745
and l'll call you
as soon as l have anything.

727
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:38,680
Promenade.

728
00:37:49,762 --> 00:37:52,230
l expected you sooner, Bareil.

729
00:37:52,264 --> 00:37:54,562
lt seems our paths
have grown apart.

730
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,569
Perhaps we can
bring them together again.

731
00:37:57,603 --> 00:38:00,071
l would like nothing
better than that.

732
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:02,006
Come with me to the school.

733
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,009
Let us both show our commitment

734
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:08,002
to a peaceful resolution
to this series of events.

735
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:10,038
Of course.

736
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:49,053
Computer, is the subspace
device integrated

737
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,216
into the isolinear coprocessor?

738
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:53,919
Confirmed.

739
00:38:55,427 --> 00:38:57,395
O'Brien to Dax.

740
00:38:57,429 --> 00:38:58,896
Go ahead.

741
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:02,367
lt's in
the isolinear coprocessor.

742
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:04,995
Didn't you just repair
that unit two days ago?

743
00:39:06,505 --> 00:39:08,200
Yes, l did.

744
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:11,533
With Neela.

745
00:39:24,557 --> 00:39:27,526
Looking around at your faces

746
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,994
l believe you feel
the shame l feel

747
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:31,724
at this sight.

748
00:39:31,797 --> 00:39:33,731
No, it's got to be
the weapon detectors

749
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:35,266
in the Promenade.

750
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:37,235
That's the only thing
those coprocessors

751
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:38,600
could possibly affect.

752
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,333
All weapon detectors appear
to be functional, Chief.

753
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:44,639
That's got to be it.

754
00:39:44,677 --> 00:39:46,645
She's good.
She's real good.

755
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:49,978
She could make it look
like they're normal.

756
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:52,984
But it's got to be
the weapon detectors.

757
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:54,747
O'Brien to Sisko.

758
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:57,756
Once, our world was
a center of learning.

759
00:39:57,823 --> 00:39:59,916
lt attracted travelers
from many other worlds.

760
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,085
Go ahead, Chief.

761
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:04,095
l'm not entirely sure, but...

762
00:40:04,129 --> 00:40:05,357
l think the weapon detectors

763
00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:07,160
on the Promenade
may have been disabled.

764
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,167
What do you mean,
you're not sure?

765
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,692
l mean Neela
may have disabled them.

766
00:40:11,737 --> 00:40:13,034
Your assistant?

767
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:16,500
Yes, sir.

768
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:19,568
...to reject violence
as a solution

769
00:40:19,612 --> 00:40:22,080
to join hands with all peoples

770
00:40:22,114 --> 00:40:24,105
and begin to trust again.

771
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,684
No!

772
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,584
The Prophets spoke.

773
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:34,779
l answered their call.

774
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:36,787
The Prophets spoke!

775
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:40,290
l answered their call!

776
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:53,238
lt was all
to get him here, wasn't it?

777
00:41:53,272 --> 00:41:55,570
The school, the protest,
the bombing--

778
00:41:55,607 --> 00:41:58,098
you knew that would get him
out of the monastery.

779
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,611
You did it all to kill him--

780
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:03,911
to stop him from becoming Kai.

781
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:37,582
Neela insists she acted alone--

782
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:41,609
unless you want to consider
the Prophets coconspirators.

783
00:42:41,653 --> 00:42:43,951
She'll never tell us the truth.

784
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:47,755
We'll never be able to prove
that Winn was involved.

785
00:42:47,793 --> 00:42:50,660
You okay?

786
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:52,527
Okay?

787
00:42:52,564 --> 00:42:54,532
l've forgotten ''okay.''

788
00:42:54,566 --> 00:42:58,229
l haven't seen ''okay''
in what seems like years.

789
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,898
l was just sitting here
thinking

790
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:03,874
last year at this time

791
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:09,040
l was fighting the Cardassians
in some nameless swamp.

792
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:11,549
And if you'd stopped by
and told me

793
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:14,381
that just one year later,
they'd be gone

794
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,388
and l'd be wearing this uniform

795
00:43:16,422 --> 00:43:19,550
up here in charge
of protecting some wormhole...

796
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:22,082
Protecting
your Celestial Temple.

797
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:28,756
l envied Vedek Winn
because she was a true believer.

798
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:32,897
l wanted my faith
to be as strong as hers.

799
00:43:32,938 --> 00:43:34,701
Maybe it is.

800
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:39,737
l've got a report
to put together for Starfleet.

801
00:43:39,778 --> 00:43:41,746
You ought to get some rest.

802
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,611
l'd rather help you.

803
00:43:44,783 --> 00:43:46,410
Commander...

804
00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:50,582
l heard what you said
to Vedek Winn at the school.

805
00:43:50,622 --> 00:43:52,749
l just wanted you to know...

806
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:53,917
you were right--

807
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:56,587
what you said
about the Bajorans--

808
00:43:56,628 --> 00:43:58,926
at least about me.

809
00:43:58,964 --> 00:44:01,899
l don't think that you're...

810
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,925
the devil.

811
00:44:05,404 --> 00:44:08,771
Maybe we have made
some progress after all.
