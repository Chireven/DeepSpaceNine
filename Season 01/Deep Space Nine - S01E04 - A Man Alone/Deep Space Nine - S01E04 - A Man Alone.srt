1
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:12,325
Do you need me, Julian?

2
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,769
How did you know it was me?

3
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:15,863
There are different ways
to recognize someone.

4
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:18,568
The rhythm of their steps,
for example.

5
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:19,940
You are remarkable.

6
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:22,468
Julian, you and l
need to have a talk

7
00:00:22,513 --> 00:00:24,777
about Trills and relationships.

8
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,646
Fine.
We'll do it over supper.

9
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,914
Quark has found me this
delightfully dry champagne

10
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:30,784
estate bottled on Korris l.

11
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:31,913
Julian...

12
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:33,583
What is this?

13
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:35,387
An Altonian brain teaser.

14
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:37,792
A brain teaser?

15
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:38,954
A puzzle.

16
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:40,122
A puzzle?

17
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,256
Mmm.

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,824
l love puzzles.

19
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:46,894
How does it work?

20
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:49,098
lt responds
to neural theta waves.

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,439
The goal is to turn the sphere
into a solid color.

22
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:53,773
And that's all?

23
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:54,937
That's all.

24
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:56,947
l've been trying to master it

25
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:00,041
on and off for, oh, 140 years.

26
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:02,917
Would you care to try?

27
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:04,648
Yes.

28
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:06,918
Just sit comfortably.

29
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:11,123
And release your tension
into my hands.

30
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:12,789
Your hands, they're cold.

31
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,128
lt's a peculiarity
of the Trill.

32
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,793
Cold hands, warm heart.

33
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:18,768
Concentrate on the sphere.

34
00:01:18,803 --> 00:01:20,498
Clear your mind.

35
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,302
This requires focus
and clarity of thought.

36
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,308
l understand completely.

37
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:28,641
What is that exotic scent
you're wearing?

38
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:30,146
Focus

39
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:32,149
and clarity of thought.

40
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:34,150
Yes, yes, l have it.

41
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:36,914
l'm going to release it
to you now, okay?

42
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:40,149
Okay.

43
00:01:40,257 --> 00:01:41,690
Computer...

44
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:45,183
transfer control
to second player.

45
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:53,398
l think your mind is still
a little busy, Julian.

46
00:01:53,437 --> 00:01:57,032
Wel... So, are you
free for supper?

47
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:59,009
Ready, Dax?

48
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:00,567
Sorry.

49
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:02,169
Perhaps another time.

50
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:04,477
Maybe you'd like to try again.

51
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,005
Doctor.

52
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,115
Computer...

53
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:13,919
reset.

54
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:25,073
Business is good, Quark.

55
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:27,581
You're almost making
an honest living.

56
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,550
A lot of new faces.

57
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,650
Hmm.

58
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:36,088
The wormhole does bring
them our way, doesn't it?

59
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:39,582
Everyone wants a piece
of the new frontier.

60
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:41,653
And l'm sure you've
already tried

61
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:43,493
to sell it to a few of them.

62
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:45,466
We made the decision together.

63
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,627
That's not true.
That's not true.

64
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:48,863
What?

65
00:04:48,904 --> 00:04:50,804
You decided and asked
me to agree with it.

66
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,502
Grapevine says Chief O'Brien
and the missus

67
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:57,444
are having problems.

68
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,610
l'll never understand
the humanoid need to...

69
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:04,346
couple.

70
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:09,316
You've never... coupled?

71
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:10,915
Choose not to.

72
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,551
Too many compromises.

73
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:15,461
You want to watch the
Karo-Net tournament.

74
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:17,965
She wants to listen to music.

75
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,466
So, you compromise.

76
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,264
You listen to music.

77
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:24,568
You like Earth jazz.
She prefers Klingon opera.

78
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,403
So, you compromise.

79
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:28,807
You listen to Klingon opera.

80
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:30,471
So, here you were

81
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:34,642
ready to have a nice night
watching the Karo-Net match

82
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:37,584
and you wind up spending
an agonizing evening

83
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,382
listening to Klingon opera.

84
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,945
That's exactly...

85
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:44,084
Keiko, sit down.

86
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,252
l didn't mean...

87
00:05:46,294 --> 00:05:48,262
What could they
be going on about

88
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:49,763
like that, anyway?

89
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:51,595
She doesn't like it here.

90
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:54,761
Mmm. Who does?

91
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:04,875
Ah...

92
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:06,938
Don't even think about it.

93
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:09,951
l can so think about it.

94
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:13,284
You might as well try
to find a drink of water

95
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:15,289
on the Yadozi Desert.

96
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:17,985
Besides, l'd say
our new Commander

97
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:19,721
is interested in her.

98
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,353
Not at all.

99
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:26,060
l know for a fact
that when she was a he

100
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,207
you know--

101
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,171
before she got this new body--

102
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,040
they were old friends.

103
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:33,772
Things change.

104
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:36,439
All right, now here we go.

105
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:41,987
How long has he been here?

106
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:44,387
All right, one more time.

107
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:48,018
He came in on a transport
last night.

108
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,857
Oh...

109
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:51,419
Something to eat?

110
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:53,124
Just steamed azna.

111
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:57,895
Well, some things
are still the same.

112
00:06:57,936 --> 00:06:59,767
lf you'd listen to me

113
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:02,467
you would eat
steamed azna, too.

114
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:04,135
Dax, did l ever tell you
about the meals

115
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:06,371
my father used to cook for us
when we were children?

116
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:08,209
All the time.

117
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:11,512
Every night in my house,
my dad insisted

118
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,519
that we have supper together
as a family.

119
00:07:14,553 --> 00:07:16,851
He would try out
his new recipes on us.

120
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:18,880
He used to call us
his test tasters.

121
00:07:18,924 --> 00:07:21,893
Steamed azna would put
years on your life.

122
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:24,691
Dax, l don't want years
on my life

123
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,221
if l can only eat steamed azna.

124
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,894
Sautѐed...

125
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:32,665
rolloped, fricasseed-- fine.

126
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:35,434
But not steamed.

127
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:42,175
l've missed your steamed azna.

128
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:47,951
You must miss Curzon, too.

129
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:50,614
He was...

130
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:53,784
you were, are...

131
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:57,227
a mentor,
another father to me.

132
00:07:57,262 --> 00:08:01,164
This happens to Trills,
Benjamin.

133
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,159
Sometimes our friendships
with other species don't survive

134
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:07,229
because of the change.

135
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:09,502
lt won't be that way with us.

136
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,237
lt's just a little uncomfortable
right now.

137
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:15,678
l suggest
that you allow yourself

138
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:19,878
to feel comfortable
with your discomfort.

139
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,011
Time can do the rest.

140
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:23,817
l don't want to talk
about this anymore.

141
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:24,982
Keiko...

142
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:38,394
Dabo!

143
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:42,463
All right.

144
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:49,746
l don't want you
on this station.

145
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,180
Yeah, well, that's too bad

146
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:53,275
because l have
every right to be here.

147
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:54,478
l decide who has rights

148
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,283
and who doesn't
on this Promenade.

149
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:59,188
You better ask your Federation
superiors about that one.

150
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:01,385
l don't have to check
with anyone.

151
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:17,131
You have 26 hours
to get off this station.

152
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:27,152
Look, l'm willing
to ask for a transfer

153
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:28,585
if that will make you happy.

154
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,417
That's not fair either.

155
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:32,923
You'd have to give up
your promotion.

156
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,425
Not necessarily.

157
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,586
l wish l knew
the right thing to do.

158
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:38,027
l'm just lost here.

159
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,826
Starfleet doesn't need
a botanist on this station.

160
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:42,731
Keiko, there's
a whole new quadrant

161
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:44,895
on the other side
of the wormhole

162
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:46,734
full of new plant life
to explore.

163
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,899
And ships going to explore it

164
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:50,909
and l'm not on any of them.

165
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:53,309
We'll be sending runabouts
through the wormhole.

166
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:54,778
l'll see to it you get to go.

167
00:09:54,813 --> 00:09:56,940
l don't need favors from you.

168
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:59,212
l just need to be useful.

169
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:04,512
Just think how much
more attractive

170
00:10:04,556 --> 00:10:06,547
this place could be
if you planted

171
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:08,992
some trees and flowers
in the Promenade.

172
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,688
You could even
create an arboretum

173
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:12,526
from the new specimens
we bring back

174
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:14,429
from the Gamma Quadrant.

175
00:10:20,072 --> 00:10:22,040
Do you really want
to raise your daughter

176
00:10:22,074 --> 00:10:24,065
in this place, Miles?

177
00:10:24,176 --> 00:10:26,167
Kira to O'Brien.

178
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:28,509
Go ahead.

179
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:32,916
We have a nonfunctional power
transfer grid on level five.

180
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:36,079
All of the upper docking pylons
are out of commission.

181
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,678
On my way.

182
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,427
Hi!

183
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:52,437
What do you want, hu-man?

184
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:54,098
My name's Jake.

185
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:55,766
l know who you are.

186
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,206
What's yours?

187
00:10:57,242 --> 00:10:58,766
Why do you care?

188
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,608
Not exactly a lot of friends
to choose from around here.

189
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:03,171
You know what l mean.

190
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:07,277
Nog.

191
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:08,980
My name is Nog.

192
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:14,653
His name is lbudan.

193
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:17,355
He used to run
black market goods through here

194
00:11:17,396 --> 00:11:19,921
to the surface
during the Cardassian occupation

195
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:22,058
gouging his fellow men

196
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,068
who needed medical supplies
and so forth.

197
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:27,537
Some Bajorans actually
considered him a hero

198
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:31,303
but l saw him let a child die
when the parents couldn't afford

199
00:11:31,343 --> 00:11:33,208
the drug that would have
saved her life.

200
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:37,545
A few years back, he killed
a Cardassian officer

201
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:40,210
who wanted a payoff
to look the other way.

202
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:42,413
He went to prison for murder.

203
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:43,921
l sent him there.

204
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,321
For murder?
What's he doing out?

205
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:48,883
The provisional government
let him go.

206
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:50,451
Killing a Cardassian

207
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:53,020
isn't considered
much of a crime nowadays.

208
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:55,693
Doesn't sound like there's
much we can do about it.

209
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:57,861
l can get him off my Promenade.

210
00:11:57,903 --> 00:12:00,030
lf he hasn't done anything wrong

211
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:02,336
you can't just arbitrarily
force him to leave.

212
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:04,035
Watch me.

213
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:05,769
Mr. Odo

214
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:08,974
you're not going to take the law
into your own hands.

215
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:10,379
The law?

216
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:14,249
Commander, laws change
depending on who's making them.

217
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:17,016
Cardassians one day,
Federation the next.

218
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:19,387
But justice is justice

219
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:20,584
and as long as l'm

220
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,956
in charge of secur...

221
00:12:21,993 --> 00:12:23,893
lf you can't work
within the rules

222
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:25,453
l'll find someone who can.

223
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:34,709
What are they?

224
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:38,612
Garanian bolites.

225
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:40,013
Come on!

226
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:45,484
l guess l know
the competition now.

227
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,648
What are you talking
about, Julian?

228
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,158
Well, did you have a nice dinner
with Commander Sisko?

229
00:13:50,193 --> 00:13:52,024
Julian, Trills do not
look for romance

230
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:53,322
the same way humans do.

231
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:55,490
ln fact, we find it
quite a nuisance.

232
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:57,021
A nuisance?

233
00:13:57,133 --> 00:14:00,330
lt's a weakness of the young,
and although a Trill host

234
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,600
may have these...
feelings occasionally

235
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:04,936
it is our wish
to live on a higher plane

236
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:07,943
to try to rise above
these kinds of temptations.

237
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:09,945
You said ''try to rise above''

238
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,913
which suggests you
don't always succeed.

239
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:13,677
Julian...

240
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:15,616
Sisko to Dr. Bashir.

241
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:16,879
Go ahead.

242
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,352
We need medical assistance

243
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:20,117
above the bar in Holosuite Four.

244
00:14:20,156 --> 00:14:21,521
Acknowledged, Commander.

245
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:23,252
l still have that champagne.

246
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:27,292
On ice.

247
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:38,440
Are you done with your shift?

248
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:40,066
Gym's not open tonight.

249
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:05,966
Help us!

250
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:07,536
Somebody help us!

251
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,764
Something is happening to us!

252
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:09,794
Get a doctor!

253
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:47,004
The door opened only twice.

254
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,740
The first time when the computer
logged lbudan's check-in

255
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:53,908
at 1700 hours, 16 minutes.

256
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,579
The suite was secured,
so no one else could enter.

257
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,817
He ran Lauriento massage
holoprogram #101A.

258
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:02,415
13 minutes later

259
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,892
the door was opened
for the second time

260
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:07,327
but since lbudan
obviously didn't exit

261
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:10,264
we have to assume
that's when the killer left.

262
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:12,961
Any evidence of a beam-in
during those 13 minutes?

263
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:14,366
No.

264
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:16,098
Well then,
how did the killer get in?

265
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,766
He might have
entered the holosuite

266
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:18,967
the same time lbudan did.

267
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:21,475
Cause of death's no mystery.

268
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:22,876
The knife was thrust

269
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:25,073
directly between the left
and right thoracic vertebrae

270
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:26,979
perforating the lower ventricle
of the heart.

271
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,142
The murderer apparently
had a decent knowledge

272
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:30,482
of Bajoran anatomy.

273
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,646
Doctor, l want you

274
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:33,985
to look for evidence
that could establish

275
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,990
that someone was
in here with him.

276
00:16:36,092 --> 00:16:37,684
l'll do a sweep
for hair follicles

277
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:40,093
any skin or cellular
remnants and DNA fragments.

278
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:43,223
How many ships have
left since yesterday?

279
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:44,790
Hmm, two.

280
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:48,395
A Federation survey ship
and a Vulcan science vessel.

281
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:49,836
Advise all ships in dock

282
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:53,137
that departures will be delayed
until further notice.

283
00:17:06,322 --> 00:17:08,847
And they were just looking
for trouble.

284
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:12,691
Those kids had no reason to be
hanging around the Promenade.

285
00:17:12,728 --> 00:17:14,958
lt's about the only place
they have to go.

286
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:17,191
We can't keep them
locked in their rooms.

287
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,860
This isn't like a starship,
Miles.

288
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:21,529
The kind of freedom children
have on the <i>Enterprise</i>

289
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:23,596
just won't work
on a space station.

290
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:26,608
There are too many ways to get
into serious trouble here.

291
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:29,110
What this place needs
is a school.

292
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:38,383
All ships have been informed
of the delays, Commander.

293
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:39,854
Major, do you know

294
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:43,347
Mr. Zayra, who operates
the Transit Aid Center?

295
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:44,359
We've met.

296
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:46,258
He was just telling me
something disturbing.

297
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:47,762
l think you should hear it.

298
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:49,628
lt's just that the murdered man,
lbudan--

299
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:51,292
l spoke to him yesterday

300
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,461
about an hour
before it happened.

301
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:54,628
Where was this?

302
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,568
Quark's.

303
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:57,903
By the dabo table.

304
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,001
lt was after his struggle
with the shape-shifter.

305
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:04,672
He told me that he was scared.

306
00:18:04,714 --> 00:18:08,343
He was afraid
that Odo would kill him.

307
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:11,944
There isn't a more honorable man

308
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:14,183
on this station
than the Constable.

309
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,485
Maybe so.

310
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,823
All l know is, an hour
later, lbudan was dead.

311
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:33,709
Computer, lights.

312
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:36,371
This was lbudan's quarters.

313
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:38,880
Feel free to look around.

314
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:40,711
Double accommodations?

315
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,274
That's what he requested

316
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:44,252
but only one passenger
was logged in.

317
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:46,778
He probably just wanted
larger quarters.

318
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:48,983
lf there's anything
else you need...

319
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:51,559
l want a record of all
the passengers on board.

320
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:53,221
Of course.

321
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:55,662
l'll get you a copy
of the ship's manifest.

322
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:02,001
Computer, how many entries
made from this terminal

323
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:03,938
during the last 78 hours?

324
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,941
Seven entries noted
in personal calendar files.

325
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:08,635
Show them to me.

326
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:15,478
Take me to Stardate 46384.

327
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:37,627
You won't get any argument
from me, Mrs. O'Brien.

328
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:40,327
When l heard what happened
this morning on the Promenade...

329
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:42,336
We weren't doing anything.

330
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,668
l don't want to talk
about this now.

331
00:19:44,706 --> 00:19:46,674
lt's this Ferengi boy, Nog--

332
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:50,769
Jake won't be having
anything more to do with him.

333
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:53,280
He's the only one here
even close to my age.

334
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:55,248
That's not exactly true, Jake.

335
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:57,547
There are 12 other children
on board

336
00:19:57,585 --> 00:19:59,177
ranging from eight to 16.

337
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,781
The problem is, there's
no structured activity for them.

338
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:06,954
Don't you miss the schools
you used to go to, Jake?

339
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:08,529
No... l guess.

340
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:10,690
Studying alone
on the computer...

341
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:13,098
it kind of gets
boring sometimes.

342
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:16,331
You know, l've never actually
been a teacher, Commander

343
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:19,966
but it's something l've
always thought about doing.

344
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:21,441
As a Starfleet Commander
and a father

345
00:20:21,476 --> 00:20:22,670
l think it's a terrific idea.

346
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,836
What do you need?

347
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:24,970
Uh...

348
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:26,843
some space.

349
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:27,939
We'll find it.

350
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:30,542
Computers?

351
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:32,712
You'll have them.

352
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:36,983
l hope you realize what you're
getting yourself into.

353
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:39,619
l can't force the Bajora,
the Ferengi or anyone else

354
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:41,526
to send their children
to your school.

355
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:42,723
And even if they do come

356
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:44,527
everyone has a different culture

357
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:45,897
a different philosophy.

358
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:48,562
l know l'll have to come up
with an innovative program

359
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:50,571
but l can't imagine any parent

360
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:53,506
not welcoming the news
of a school opening here.

361
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,532
Thank you, Commander.

362
00:21:00,615 --> 00:21:04,142
lf l hear of you
hanging around with him...

363
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:07,985
l thought you didn't want
to talk about this now.

364
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:12,617
These are the DNA
sequence analyses

365
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,888
the cellular spectrographs

366
00:21:13,928 --> 00:21:15,623
and the particulate
matter tracers.

367
00:21:15,663 --> 00:21:17,961
l asked Lieutenant Dax
to confirm my findings

368
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,296
and l'm afraid she concurs.

369
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:23,794
There were no new DNA traces
found in the holosuite.

370
00:21:23,838 --> 00:21:26,705
You're saying nobody went
into the room with him.

371
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:29,175
Well, apart from those of us
who were in there

372
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,611
after the body was discovered,
this was the only DNA present.

373
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:34,808
And we've identified
it as lbudan's.

374
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:35,816
Wait a minute.

375
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,715
lbudan goes
into the holosuite alone

376
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:38,946
locks the door.

377
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,511
Nobody transports in.

378
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:42,216
A few minutes later,
he's murdered.

379
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:43,622
How is that possible?

380
00:21:43,658 --> 00:21:44,784
lt's not...

381
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:47,124
unless the murder was committed

382
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:50,791
by someone who could get through
the cracks in the door.

383
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:53,323
Say... a shape-shifter.

384
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:09,780
lt's a pretty neat package.

385
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:12,342
His calendar shows he was
planning to meet with me

386
00:22:12,387 --> 00:22:13,649
at the time of the murder.

387
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:16,714
No one except a shape-shifter
could get into the holosuite.

388
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:18,726
And since l'd obviously
be called there

389
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,159
after the body was discovered

390
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:22,789
traces of my DNA wind up
at the scene of the crime.

391
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,196
Do you have
any kind of an alibi?

392
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:28,168
Major, l have to return
to my natural state

393
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:30,137
every 18 hours to regenerate.

394
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:31,968
To be quite honest about it

395
00:22:32,006 --> 00:22:34,736
l was in a pail
in the back of my office

396
00:22:34,776 --> 00:22:36,334
when lbudan was killed.

397
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:39,869
The killer might have known
your regenerative cycle

398
00:22:39,914 --> 00:22:42,314
and planned the murder
accordingly.

399
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,183
Like l said, a neat package.

400
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,451
Who might want
to frame you for murder?

401
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:51,458
l can think of
about 500 different people

402
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:55,189
but l haven't seen any of them
around the station recently.

403
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,963
Do you think
that Federation doctor

404
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:03,630
could do a sweep
of lbudan's quarters for me?

405
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:04,933
See if he can find out

406
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:07,498
if somebody else was using
that second bed?

407
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:10,909
l'll send him
over there right away.

408
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:14,213
Thank you, Major.

409
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,546
Dabo!

410
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:23,751
You want my boy to go
to a Federation school?

411
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,258
Not just Federation.

412
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:27,261
l'm developing a curriculum

413
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:29,263
that will take
a much broader approach.

414
00:23:29,297 --> 00:23:30,958
Little lady, little lady.

415
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:33,592
What do you know
of Ferengi education?

416
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:36,695
l understand you employ
a work-study approach, Mr. Rom

417
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:39,104
with apprenticeships
in a wide range

418
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,267
of business and economic fields.

419
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:45,746
We throw them
into the cutthroat competition

420
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,179
of Ferengi commerce

421
00:23:47,215 --> 00:23:49,683
and anyone who survives,
graduates.

422
00:23:49,717 --> 00:23:51,844
Are you prepared
to teach that to my son?

423
00:23:51,886 --> 00:23:54,855
l'm sure l couldn't improve on
what you've already taught him

424
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:56,186
in that department.

425
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:57,691
Thank you.
Thank you.

426
00:23:57,725 --> 00:23:59,659
l've taught him
everything l know.

427
00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:01,924
lt's so important
that we prepare our youths

428
00:24:01,963 --> 00:24:03,692
for the challenges
of the future.

429
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:04,857
Exactly.

430
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:06,196
Consider the advantage

431
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:08,464
your son will have
over other Ferengi

432
00:24:08,503 --> 00:24:10,869
once he's learned
about other cultures--

433
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:12,566
once he's learned
how others

434
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:14,199
run their economies

435
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:16,767
conduct business, negotiate...

436
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:19,041
You will teach my son
these things?

437
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,707
Knowledge is power, Mr. Rom.

438
00:24:20,748 --> 00:24:22,215
lt can't work.

439
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,309
He will not listen to you.

440
00:24:24,352 --> 00:24:26,149
Why not?

441
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:27,586
You are female.

442
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:28,748
So?

443
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,453
My son cannot learn anything
from a female human teacher.

444
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:33,960
Let him try it for a few weeks.

445
00:24:33,995 --> 00:24:36,964
He has nothing to lose
and so much to gain.

446
00:24:37,065 --> 00:24:38,589
l don't think so.

447
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:40,828
Will you at least
think about it?

448
00:24:40,868 --> 00:24:42,199
Yes, yes, of course.

449
00:24:42,236 --> 00:24:43,897
Now, really, l'm quite busy.

450
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:46,873
Place your wagers,
place your wagers.

451
00:24:46,908 --> 00:24:50,309
Get this lovely young woman
a drink.

452
00:24:50,345 --> 00:24:51,972
What do we really
know about him anyway?

453
00:24:52,046 --> 00:24:53,411
He's not one of us.

454
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:55,075
He isn't one of anything.

455
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:57,945
You know what
really bothers me?

456
00:24:57,985 --> 00:25:00,385
This shifter was the
last Chief of Security

457
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:02,150
when the Cardassians
were here.

458
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,591
Yeah, he's the one
who caught lbudan for them.

459
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:07,150
Why is he still Security Chief?

460
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:08,423
You're right.

461
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:11,455
We ought to talk to Major Kira.

462
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:13,831
Nobody knows him
like l know him.

463
00:25:13,868 --> 00:25:15,927
Let me tell you something.

464
00:25:16,003 --> 00:25:19,166
He's an ill-tempered,
overbearing crosspatch.

465
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:21,698
But he was
no Cardassian collaborator

466
00:25:21,743 --> 00:25:23,301
and he's no killer.

467
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:26,313
l can't believe
you're defending him, Quark.

468
00:25:26,347 --> 00:25:28,281
You're his worst enemy.

469
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:30,079
Guess that's the closest thing

470
00:25:30,118 --> 00:25:32,018
he has in this world
to a friend.

471
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:45,088
Security, huh?

472
00:26:49,335 --> 00:26:51,496
Listen, l hear
what you're saying.

473
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:53,368
l understand your concerns.

474
00:26:53,406 --> 00:26:54,430
We're not saying whether

475
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:55,941
he's innocent or guilty,
Commander.

476
00:26:55,975 --> 00:26:57,067
All we're saying...

477
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,044
lsn't it reasonable
under the circumstances...

478
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:01,410
Thank you very much for coming.

479
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:23,663
Oh, this is wrong.

480
00:27:23,703 --> 00:27:26,228
And what would you
suggest we do?

481
00:27:26,272 --> 00:27:27,899
He didn't do it.

482
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,272
The man we have in charge
of a murder investigation

483
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:31,867
is the prime suspect, Major.

484
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:34,004
Those people have
a right to complain.

485
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:36,173
Even if he's innocent

486
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:37,910
it could still seem like

487
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,679
a conflict of interest, Kira.

488
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,211
You're going to relieve him
of duty.

489
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:45,121
l don't see any other choice.

490
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:48,594
He has been completely candid
about this investigation.

491
00:27:48,628 --> 00:27:51,893
He could have covered his tracks
half a dozen times already

492
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:53,398
if he were guilty.

493
00:27:53,432 --> 00:27:55,923
l appreciate how you feel

494
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:58,027
but the decision stands.

495
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,970
l'll inform him myself.

496
00:28:05,378 --> 00:28:08,211
The only curious thing l found
were these seofurance fragments

497
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:09,714
near the matter
reclamation unit.

498
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:10,738
Dish, please.

499
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:15,186
lt appears he was trying
to get rid of them.

500
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:17,018
Do you have any idea
what they're from?

501
00:28:17,056 --> 00:28:18,387
l know exactly
what they're from.

502
00:28:18,424 --> 00:28:19,652
A biological sample container.

503
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:21,489
l use them all the time.

504
00:28:21,527 --> 00:28:22,892
What would lbudan be doing

505
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:24,829
with a biological
sample container?

506
00:28:24,864 --> 00:28:26,058
Well, that l'm not so sure about

507
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:27,395
but when l analyzed
the fragments

508
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:30,527
l detected traces
of a complex organic structure.

509
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,901
Translate, Doctor.

510
00:28:31,938 --> 00:28:34,202
lt suggests lbudan may
have been conducting

511
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,334
some sort of medical
experiment on board his ship.

512
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:39,640
He wasn't a doctor
or a scientist.

513
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,704
Well, let's see what a standard

514
00:28:41,747 --> 00:28:44,079
electrophoretic analysis
tells us.

515
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:52,089
What the...?

516
00:28:52,124 --> 00:28:53,591
The complex proteins

517
00:28:53,626 --> 00:28:56,151
are breaking down
into DNA fragments.

518
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:57,924
Now what does that mean?

519
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,429
lt means...

520
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:01,865
we should set up
a bioregenerative field

521
00:29:01,901 --> 00:29:04,335
to accelerate
the cellular development.

522
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,634
lf l can reconstruct
the DNA sequence

523
00:29:06,672 --> 00:29:09,266
it might just give us
an idea what he was up to.

524
00:29:09,308 --> 00:29:10,605
Sisko to Odo.

525
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:11,871
Here.

526
00:29:11,978 --> 00:29:14,139
May l see you in my office,
please?

527
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,511
Acknowledged.

528
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,367
Commander?

529
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:40,804
Sit down.

530
00:29:46,178 --> 00:29:49,011
l am temporarily
relieving you of duty.

531
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:52,575
l'm sure the reasons
are obvious.

532
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:55,917
Who will be taking over
the investigation?

533
00:29:55,988 --> 00:29:58,684
l've placed Major Kira
and Lieutenant Dax in charge.

534
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:04,729
Will that be all, Commander?

535
00:30:04,764 --> 00:30:07,562
l want you to know
l don't personally believe

536
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,932
that you're responsible
for this.

537
00:30:10,036 --> 00:30:12,766
Really?

538
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:15,569
Now, how can that be true?

539
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:18,168
You don't know me.

540
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,407
You have no reason to believe
l wouldn't kill lbudan

541
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:22,937
if it suited my fancy.

542
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:26,951
So don't tell me there isn't
some doubt inside of you--

543
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:29,351
some question
about whether or not

544
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:31,151
l murdered the man.

545
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,215
l simply feel
that putting Kira and Dax

546
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:34,886
in charge of the investigation

547
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:36,758
will be in everyone's
best interest

548
00:30:36,796 --> 00:30:39,458
including your own.

549
00:30:39,498 --> 00:30:42,695
l'll take care
of my own best interests.

550
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:58,176
That's him.

551
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:03,382
Yeah, they found his DNA...

552
00:31:39,258 --> 00:31:41,226
l can find out
who did it for you.

553
00:31:42,294 --> 00:31:43,761
Not for me.

554
00:31:43,796 --> 00:31:45,525
Tell it to Starfleet.

555
00:31:45,564 --> 00:31:48,260
l'm not in charge
here any longer.

556
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,100
Well now, there's a piece
of good news to brighten my day.

557
00:31:52,138 --> 00:31:53,264
You better take advantage

558
00:31:53,305 --> 00:31:54,897
of my absence while
you can, Quark.

559
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,568
Oh, l will, l will.
Count on it.

560
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,602
l'll have every
confidence man in the sector

561
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:01,874
on board by tomorrow.

562
00:32:01,914 --> 00:32:02,881
You do and l'll...

563
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:03,904
What?

564
00:32:03,949 --> 00:32:06,076
You're going to get sloppy

565
00:32:06,118 --> 00:32:08,416
without me to keep
an eye on you.

566
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:10,081
l don't think so.

567
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:13,353
You've kept me on my toes
for far too long now.

568
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,019
Sure.

569
00:32:15,061 --> 00:32:18,030
l've turned you
into a better crook.

570
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:19,656
Like it or not.

571
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:26,429
Quark, think you could use

572
00:32:26,472 --> 00:32:30,408
a shape-shifter
in your organization?

573
00:32:32,144 --> 00:32:34,806
Uh...

574
00:32:38,017 --> 00:32:39,609
You had me going.

575
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:43,414
l did, didn't l?

576
00:32:43,456 --> 00:32:44,980
Yes, you did.

577
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:54,596
You know, l've been
asking some friends

578
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:57,864
at Kran-Tobal Prison
about lbudan--

579
00:32:57,903 --> 00:33:01,771
whether he made any enemies
while he was there.

580
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:03,502
Couldn't find any.

581
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:06,773
Mostly he stayed around
the Bajoran dissidents

582
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:09,576
that the Cardassians locked up.

583
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:25,662
lt's growing exponentially.

584
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:28,894
We're going to have to increase
the metabolic field energy.

585
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,197
Just what is it
that's growing in there?

586
00:33:31,236 --> 00:33:33,329
Aren't those DNA patterns
humanoid, Julian?

587
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:34,736
Well, that's what
it looks like to me

588
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:38,470
but there's a genetic drift
l can't quite put my finger on.

589
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,841
What was lbudan up to?

590
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:41,345
We're going to have
to wait and see

591
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:43,347
what this becomes
before we have a clue.

592
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:45,349
You can transfer it
to the larger field now.

593
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:46,247
Yes, Doctor.

594
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:47,581
Care for lunch?

595
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:48,916
Sure.

596
00:33:48,954 --> 00:33:50,251
No, thank you.

597
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:52,586
Major Kira's waiting
for my report.

598
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:04,861
Just how many different lives
do you think she's led?

599
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,437
l don't even know.

600
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:10,737
He'll go... she'll go
through a list of them

601
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:12,868
then out comes another one
in a later conversation.

602
00:34:12,944 --> 00:34:16,345
l'd guess that Jadzia
is probably the sixth host.

603
00:34:16,381 --> 00:34:17,348
Has she changed much?

604
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:18,349
Changed?

605
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:20,681
From the last one, Curzon Dax?

606
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,177
l understand a Trill
integrates the personality

607
00:34:24,222 --> 00:34:25,883
of each new host.

608
00:34:25,957 --> 00:34:28,687
l guess l'll have
to find that out.

609
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:31,821
lf l were to tell you
some of the mischief

610
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:34,024
he and l used to get into...

611
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:36,898
There was a time when
l was no older than you are

612
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:40,894
we were attending the running
of the Rujian Steeplechase.

613
00:34:40,939 --> 00:34:42,497
Dax loves the races.

614
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,134
Anyway, there were
these gorgeous, seven-foot

615
00:34:45,176 --> 00:34:47,610
Ruji twin sisters
that Curzon knew.

616
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:49,237
And he and l...

617
00:34:53,651 --> 00:34:58,247
l guess we won't be doing that
again soon, will we?

618
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:00,257
You care for her
a great deal, don't you?

619
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:05,056
Dax and l
are just friends, Doctor.

620
00:35:05,096 --> 00:35:06,825
lf you're interested

621
00:35:06,865 --> 00:35:09,390
you have nothing to fear
from me.

622
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:11,800
l mean,
if l were in your shoes

623
00:35:11,836 --> 00:35:14,600
knowing Dax
as intimately as you do

624
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,472
l think l'd find her
hard to resist.

625
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:19,568
You don't understand, Doctor.

626
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:22,171
Dax used to beat me
regularly at bare fist

627
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:23,680
Juro Counterpunch.

628
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:27,344
Well, l guess you won't be doing
that again soon either.

629
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:29,410
Let's get out of here.

630
00:35:29,454 --> 00:35:32,548
No, l'm not drinking
with scum.

631
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,251
l won't drink near this man.

632
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:35,452
Come on, let's go.

633
00:35:50,408 --> 00:35:53,775
Yeah, in a semicircle here
facing the module.

634
00:35:53,812 --> 00:35:56,144
That's right.

635
00:35:56,181 --> 00:35:58,172
Thank you.

636
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,642
Ah.

637
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:04,154
Here's Mommy.

638
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:06,316
Where have you been, Mommy?

639
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:08,154
l've been getting ready

640
00:36:08,193 --> 00:36:09,421
for school tomorrow, honey.

641
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:10,428
Can l come to school?

642
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:11,429
Oh, l wish you could.

643
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,897
At least then l'd know
one student would be coming.

644
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:16,696
But you have
to wait a year or two.

645
00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:17,962
How's it going?

646
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:19,230
We'll be ready in time.

647
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,862
ln time for what, l'm not sure.

648
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:22,463
Aside from Commander Sisko

649
00:36:22,507 --> 00:36:24,099
we haven't had
a firm commitment

650
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:25,404
from any of the parents.

651
00:36:25,443 --> 00:36:26,740
What's this?

652
00:36:26,778 --> 00:36:28,769
Just a little something
l replicated

653
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:29,871
on the way over.

654
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:31,711
Help Mommy to open
her present, Molly.

655
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,513
Come on.

656
00:36:34,552 --> 00:36:36,179
Yeah, go on.

657
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:38,712
Pull.

658
00:36:38,756 --> 00:36:41,725
Oh, Miles.

659
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:45,596
Thank you.

660
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,598
l want to see you standing

661
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:49,259
in the Promenade
tomorrow morning

662
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,461
ringing your school bell.

663
00:36:52,637 --> 00:36:55,231
Murderer!

664
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:57,264
l better take her home.

665
00:36:58,877 --> 00:36:59,844
Murderer!

666
00:36:59,878 --> 00:37:00,845
Killer!

667
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:02,972
Don't you know
you're not wanted?

668
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:04,447
There he is. Get him.

669
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:05,779
You don't belong...

670
00:37:05,817 --> 00:37:07,682
Murderer!
Shape-shifting freak!

671
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:20,664
Murderer!

672
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:22,632
O'Brien to Ops.

673
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,397
Security to the Promenade,
on the double.

674
00:37:25,436 --> 00:37:26,903
Acknowledged.

675
00:37:27,906 --> 00:37:29,703
Yes, sir.

676
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:31,368
O'Brien to Sisko.

677
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:32,876
l'm here, Chief.

678
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:34,538
What's going on?

679
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:36,774
We've got a crowd--
more like a mob--

680
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:38,111
outside Odo's office.

681
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:40,413
You better get down here.

682
00:38:10,014 --> 00:38:13,313
Freak!
Shape-shifter!

683
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:14,613
Freak!

684
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:16,347
Shape-shifter!

685
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:18,355
Murdering shifter!

686
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:20,550
Shape-shifter!

687
00:38:22,894 --> 00:38:24,452
Odo's inside?

688
00:38:24,495 --> 00:38:26,258
Yes, sir. He went in
a few minutes ago.

689
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:27,855
The crowd followed him
from the bar.

690
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:29,866
l want more security here,
and l want them armed.

691
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:30,959
Aye, sir.

692
00:38:31,002 --> 00:38:32,367
lt's going to be harder
to control them

693
00:38:32,403 --> 00:38:33,392
if the numbers keep growing.

694
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:34,530
We can secure all turbolifts--

695
00:38:34,572 --> 00:38:36,039
slow down the traffic
onto the Promenade.

696
00:38:36,074 --> 00:38:38,304
Good idea.

697
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:49,881
Julian, look at this.

698
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:52,980
The chromatin pattern's
changing.

699
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:54,719
lt's definitely humanoid.

700
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:57,227
lt's definitely
humanoid.

701
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:03,661
lt's definitely...
My God!

702
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:05,328
Dax, l think l know what it is.

703
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,304
Run a chromosome analysis.

704
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:09,898
l think we're going to find
a gene-sequence degradation.

705
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:23,677
Shifter! Shifter!

706
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,686
Shifter!

707
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,453
Shifter! Shifter! Shifter!

708
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,389
Coming through.

709
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:41,232
What the hell do you people
intend to accomplish here?

710
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,794
We want the shape-shifter.

711
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,135
And what do you think

712
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,300
you're going to do to him
if you get to him?

713
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,434
He deserves to die.

714
00:39:47,476 --> 00:39:48,465
'Bout time!

715
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,876
He's right!

716
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:53,115
How do you get a rope

717
00:39:53,149 --> 00:39:54,616
around the neck
of a shape-shifter?

718
00:39:55,651 --> 00:39:56,743
Listen to me.

719
00:39:56,786 --> 00:39:59,220
You will disperse immediately.

720
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:00,847
Return to your quarters.

721
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:02,447
Return to your ships.

722
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,734
He's a murderer.

723
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:18,603
We want justice.

724
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:19,869
Do you?

725
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:21,842
Justice?

726
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,208
Really?

727
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:25,008
ls it justice you're after

728
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:29,074
or just some way to express
your anger, your fear?

729
00:40:29,118 --> 00:40:30,813
Look at yourselves.

730
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:34,345
ln an hour, you'll regret
what you tried to do here.

731
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,721
Do not condemn this man

732
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:37,885
because he is different
than you are.

733
00:40:37,993 --> 00:40:41,394
We condemn him because
of the evidence.

734
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,988
Yeah!

735
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:45,660
Then take that evidence
to a court of law.

736
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:48,169
There will be no justice
served here today.

737
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:49,171
Commander!

738
00:40:49,205 --> 00:40:50,638
Commander Sisko,
l believe we have

739
00:40:50,673 --> 00:40:52,800
some new evidence to consider.

740
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:55,140
The man who was murdered
was not lbudan.

741
00:40:55,177 --> 00:40:56,542
What?!

742
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,274
Come with me.

743
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:04,616
All right, break it up now.

744
00:41:04,653 --> 00:41:05,620
Move on, people.

745
00:41:05,654 --> 00:41:06,746
Let's clear the area.

746
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:08,256
You heard what she said.
Let's go.

747
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,655
Come on.
Back to your quarters.

748
00:41:09,692 --> 00:41:10,716
Quickly. Move!

749
00:41:10,893 --> 00:41:12,383
A clone.

750
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,862
That's what lbudan
was working on.

751
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,023
Creating a clone of himself.

752
00:41:17,066 --> 00:41:18,693
And then he killed the clone

753
00:41:18,734 --> 00:41:21,100
to frame me for his murder.

754
00:41:21,136 --> 00:41:24,196
How can we be sure
the victim was a clone?

755
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,708
A clone has identical DNA
to that of the donor

756
00:41:26,742 --> 00:41:28,505
but certain cloning
methods cause

757
00:41:28,544 --> 00:41:31,980
a characteristic
gene-sequence degradation

758
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:33,777
which can be detected.

759
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:35,113
lf you know to look for it.

760
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,050
We've matched
the victim's gene sequence

761
00:41:37,086 --> 00:41:39,054
with the fellow in the jar here.

762
00:41:39,088 --> 00:41:40,612
They're definitely both clones.

763
00:41:40,656 --> 00:41:42,123
And what happens to this one?

764
00:41:42,157 --> 00:41:43,385
ln about two days

765
00:41:43,425 --> 00:41:45,552
he becomes a living,
breathing member

766
00:41:45,594 --> 00:41:47,221
of Bajoran society.

767
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:50,164
Let's hope he doesn't follow
in his donor's footsteps.

768
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,133
What about lbudan?

769
00:41:54,336 --> 00:41:56,998
l have an idea
where to find him.

770
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,146
Computer, lights.

771
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:17,859
Who are you?

772
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,120
How did you get in here?

773
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,061
Oh, l think you know.

774
00:42:21,096 --> 00:42:23,587
l warn you,
l'll call Ship Security.

775
00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:25,259
Do that.

776
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:28,270
l have some interesting
questions to ask them.

777
00:42:28,304 --> 00:42:30,534
For example, l'm especially
curious to know

778
00:42:30,572 --> 00:42:31,766
how the name Lamonay S.

779
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,243
came to appear on this ship's
passenger list yesterday.

780
00:42:35,277 --> 00:42:36,710
That is my name

781
00:42:36,745 --> 00:42:38,770
and l arranged transport
on this vessel.

782
00:42:38,814 --> 00:42:40,873
Why should that be so strange?

783
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:43,884
You did not arrive on this ship.

784
00:42:43,986 --> 00:42:45,783
No.

785
00:42:45,821 --> 00:42:49,120
Well, just what ship did you
arrive on, Mr. Lamonay S.?

786
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:50,887
l can't find any record
of your arrival

787
00:42:50,993 --> 00:42:53,791
on any vessel that has docked
here in the last three weeks.

788
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,461
l assure you, you are in error.

789
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,764
ln fact, l think you
did arrive on this ship

790
00:43:00,803 --> 00:43:02,668
and that you spent
the last few years

791
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,468
in a prison among
Bajoran dissidents.

792
00:43:04,506 --> 00:43:06,440
One of whom l've
learned was a scientist

793
00:43:06,475 --> 00:43:08,170
who was arrested
by the Cardassians

794
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,973
for conducting
experimental research

795
00:43:10,012 --> 00:43:11,240
into tri-phasic cloning.

796
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,217
Killing your own clone
is still murder.

797
00:43:22,257 --> 00:43:26,853
Commander's Log,
Stardate 46421.5.

798
00:43:26,962 --> 00:43:29,396
lbudan has been turned over
to the Bajoran authorities

799
00:43:29,431 --> 00:43:31,365
just hours after his clone
gained consciousness

800
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,231
and began a new life.

801
00:43:33,268 --> 00:43:34,860
The perpetrators
of the mob violence

802
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,870
have retreated
into their own business.

803
00:43:36,939 --> 00:43:40,340
To my knowledge,
Odo has received no apologies.

804
00:43:40,376 --> 00:43:43,470
Meanwhile, life on the station
has begun to return to normal.

805
00:43:43,512 --> 00:43:45,412
Computer, what time is it?

806
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:47,972
0907 hours.

807
00:43:50,285 --> 00:43:51,752
l guess you were right.

808
00:43:51,787 --> 00:43:53,414
lt isn't going to be easy.

809
00:43:53,455 --> 00:43:55,480
Maybe it's just going
to take a little time...

810
00:43:55,524 --> 00:43:58,459
Sit down!

811
00:43:58,494 --> 00:44:00,462
Not next to that human boy.

812
00:44:00,496 --> 00:44:03,829
l don't want you to have
anything to do with him.

813
00:44:06,335 --> 00:44:09,930
We'll... try it
for a few weeks.

814
00:44:17,646 --> 00:44:19,580
Please come in.

815
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,742
Uh, take any seat.

816
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,684
Try to be on time from now on.

817
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:25,380
My name is Keiko O'Brien.

818
00:44:25,421 --> 00:44:26,820
l'll be your teacher.

819
00:44:26,855 --> 00:44:29,255
Why don't we turn
on our computers

820
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:32,590
and access the files on Bajor
to find out a little bit more

821
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,062
about the people and
history of this world.
