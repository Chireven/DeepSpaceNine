1
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:39,227
Shoes.

2
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:47,467
Jake, l've got a terrific
surprise for you.

3
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,532
Oh, yeah?
What is it?

4
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:51,803
The two of us are going to Bajor

5
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,708
for the start
of the Gratitude Festival.

6
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:55,542
What's the Gratitude Festival?

7
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,208
lt's the biggest Bajoran
holiday of the year.

8
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,218
Major Kira says
it's pretty spectacular.

9
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,117
And l figured
while we were on the surface

10
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:03,587
we could visit
those fire caverns

11
00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:04,816
you've been wanting to see.

12
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,653
Sounds great.
When do we leave?

13
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,683
This afternoon,
right after school.

14
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,121
For how long?

15
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:13,461
Three days.

16
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:15,489
Three days?

17
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,434
Computer, orange juice.

18
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:19,164
Dad, do l have to go?

19
00:01:19,237 --> 00:01:21,171
Well, no...

20
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,696
not if you don't want to.

21
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:23,969
Thanks, Dad.

22
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:26,170
Nog and l kind of have plans
for tomorrow.

23
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,803
What kind of plans?

24
00:01:27,846 --> 00:01:28,904
There's an Andorian freighter

25
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:30,676
due in for a maintenance check
tomorrow night.

26
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,683
An Andorian freighter?

27
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,345
Uh, it's supposed to be carrying
a shipment

28
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,581
of those new antigrav tractors.

29
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:39,556
We're hoping
we'll get a chance to see one.

30
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:41,320
Uh, let me get this straight.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,090
You would rather hang around
a cargo bay with Nog

32
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,121
than visit the Bajoran
fire caverns with the old man?

33
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:49,156
Nog's my friend.

34
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:56,140
No need to thank me, madam.

35
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:57,471
Here at Quark's

36
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,001
customer satisfaction
is our primary concern.

37
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:03,378
Now, you run along
back to the dabo table.

38
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,584
Rom, that lady tells me

39
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,020
she misplaced
a fat currency pouch.

40
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:12,114
Yes, brother?

41
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:13,317
And that you found it.

42
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:14,416
Yes, brother.

43
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,825
And that you returned
it to her intact.

44
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:18,659
l was dazzled by her beauty.

45
00:02:18,697 --> 00:02:21,257
You worthless, tiny-eared fool.

46
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:22,994
Don't you know
the First Rule of Acquisition?

47
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:24,001
Yes, brother.

48
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:25,400
Then say it.

49
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:29,874
''Once you have their money,
you never give it back.''

50
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:31,170
Exactly.

51
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,177
You can ponder its meaning
this evening

52
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:37,170
while polishing
every rail in the place.

53
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:38,511
Now get out of my sight

54
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,814
before l toss you out
the nearest airlock.

55
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:52,656
Nog!

56
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,399
ls this what they teach you
at that human school of yours?

57
00:02:58,437 --> 00:02:59,802
Sloth and indolence?

58
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:01,135
No, Father.

59
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:02,504
We'll see about that.

60
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,635
Tonight, you'll polish
every rail in the place

61
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:06,939
until they sparkle.

62
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,104
ls that clear?

63
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,272
Yes, Father, tonight--

64
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,077
every rail.

65
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,863
And, so, the Andorian says

66
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:31,130
''Your brother?
l thought it was your wife.''

67
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,369
Get it?

68
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,465
''Wife...''

69
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:41,068
Had to think about that one,
didn't you?

70
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:42,943
l'm looking for Quark.

71
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:44,312
You found him.

72
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:47,751
l'm Krax

73
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:52,746
and this is my father,
Grand Nagus Zek.

74
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,761
Tell me, is the Grand Nagus here

75
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:07,931
on business or pleasure?

76
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:09,440
ls there a difference?

77
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:10,771
No, of course not.

78
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:14,267
My father will reveal
the purpose of his visit

79
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:15,609
when he sees fit.

80
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:19,048
As for now, he desires
the use of a holosuite.

81
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:21,484
He's heard
that some of your programs

82
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,817
are quite alluring.

83
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:24,287
Oh, they are, they are.

84
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:28,656
But, uh, they may prove
a touch energetic

85
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:31,321
for his advanced years.

86
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:33,297
Are you refusing his request?

87
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:34,730
Not at all, not at all.

88
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:38,293
ls there a particular activity
he'd like to sample?

89
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:40,031
The Nagus dislikes
having to choose

90
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,971
between so many
delightful possibilities.

91
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:42,996
ln that case...

92
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:48,945
Here's a list of five programs

93
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,972
that rank among
my personal favorites.

94
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:54,986
l'd be happy
to select one for him.

95
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,011
That won't be necessary.

96
00:04:57,055 --> 00:05:00,218
The Nagus has decided
to try all five.

97
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,350
Sorry l'm late

98
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:06,355
but the transporter in Ops
needed a minor adjustment

99
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:08,414
in its upper
molecular imaging scanner.

100
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:12,553
But never mind that.

101
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:14,324
All right, let's settle down.

102
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:16,797
Let's settle down!

103
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:20,431
Jake, Nog!

104
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:22,061
What we do is....

105
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:23,229
Nog!

106
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:27,373
Thank you.

107
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,245
Now, we only have two more weeks
to get through

108
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:34,181
before Mrs. O'Brien
returns from Earth.

109
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:36,684
So that shouldn't be
too difficult.

110
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:38,186
Right?

111
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:42,950
Right. Let's get out
our homework padds.

112
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:45,460
We'll begin
with the older students.

113
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:46,893
Your last assignment

114
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:50,865
was to write an essay
defining the term ''ethics.''

115
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,231
Let's start with...

116
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:54,236
Nog.

117
00:07:56,238 --> 00:07:58,536
l don't have my essay.

118
00:07:58,574 --> 00:07:59,632
Why not?

119
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:01,199
My padd was stolen.

120
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:02,471
ls that a fact?

121
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:04,843
Any idea who stole it?

122
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,507
lt happened at Quark's.

123
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:07,914
l put it on a table

124
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,544
and there were
some Vulcans nearby...

125
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:11,746
Hold on.

126
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:16,190
You're saying Vulcans
stole your homework?

127
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:17,522
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,960
Any idea why?

129
00:08:23,532 --> 00:08:26,194
Because they don't have ethics?

130
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:31,267
All right, that's enough.

131
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:32,831
lt's the truth.

132
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,399
Ask Jake.

133
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:36,138
He was with me.

134
00:08:38,214 --> 00:08:40,182
Go on.

135
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:41,843
Tell him.

136
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,910
l guess so.

137
00:08:47,022 --> 00:08:48,387
You guess so?

138
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:54,392
He... yeah.

139
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,727
They took it.

140
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:56,992
l was there.

141
00:08:57,032 --> 00:09:01,526
All right, but l want
that essay in tomorrow.

142
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,662
ls that understood?

143
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:03,672
Yes.

144
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:04,832
l hope so.

145
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:18,011
Did the Nagus happen to mention

146
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:21,022
how long he'd be
using the holosuite?

147
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:23,524
The Nagus will be done
when he's done.

148
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,026
What if he injured himself?

149
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,528
My father left
specific instructions

150
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:28,962
not to be disturbed.

151
00:09:28,998 --> 00:09:31,330
Are you suggesting
we disobey him?

152
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,562
Forget l ever said anything.

153
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:44,972
The Grand Nagus--
here under our roof.

154
00:09:45,014 --> 00:09:47,073
l've never been so proud.

155
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:48,843
l hope you can live on pride

156
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:50,408
because that's all
we'll have left

157
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:51,680
once he's through with us.

158
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,188
You think he's here
to take over the bar?

159
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:56,088
Why else would he
have come all this way?

160
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:58,558
To buy me out

161
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:00,425
for a fraction of what
the place is worth.

162
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:02,589
You could always refuse to sell.

163
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:05,225
Oh, why didn't l think of that?

164
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,098
ldiot!

165
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:11,229
The Nagus doesn't take
''no'' for an answer.

166
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:12,797
Quark.

167
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,868
Here.

168
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:24,875
Good program.

169
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,478
My father requires rest.

170
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:28,114
l would imagine.

171
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:31,456
Uh, please feel free
to use my own...

172
00:10:31,493 --> 00:10:33,324
brother's quarters

173
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:36,354
for as long as you're with us.

174
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:37,729
That should be satisfactory.

175
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:40,564
Now, uh, is there
anything else l could do

176
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:42,764
to make your stay
a pleasant one?

177
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:45,672
lnvite me to dinner.

178
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,074
l'd be honored.

179
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:52,447
Chief, l just heard Airlock 9
is jammed again.

180
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:54,472
l'll get a crew on it
immediately, Commander.

181
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:55,540
Ensign Jonas?

182
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:59,553
So, how's school?

183
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:01,522
We'll muddle through, l imagine

184
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:04,856
though l'm counting the days
till Keiko gets back.

185
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:06,554
Are the students
giving you a hard time?

186
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:07,857
Well, you know how it is, sir.

187
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:10,194
Kids-- there's nothing
they like better

188
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:12,598
than to take advantage
of a substitute teacher.

189
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:13,932
l always did.

190
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:15,960
l hope Jake's behaving himself.

191
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:17,267
Jake?

192
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:19,274
He's a fine lad, sir.

193
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:20,673
lt's just...

194
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:22,540
well...

195
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:24,045
Just what?

196
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,513
lt's just, if he were my son

197
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:30,109
l'd find a friend for him
other than Nog.

198
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:32,211
l'm afraid that's
easier said than done.

199
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:35,121
The two of them have
become inseparable.

200
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,715
l'd find a way
to separate them, sir.

201
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,694
That Nog's a bad influence.

202
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:42,390
l appreciate the advice,
Chief, but l trust my son.

203
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,324
Besides, if l get
between them now

204
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:48,631
it would become me versus Nog

205
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:51,071
and l'm not going to force
Jake to choose between us.

206
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:52,664
Why not?

207
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,300
Because l'd probably lose.

208
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:55,742
Oh, l doubt that, sir.

209
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:58,144
That's because
your daughter's three.

210
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,444
Wait until she's 14.

211
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:26,265
Are you sure?

212
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:42,047
My compliments, Quark.

213
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:47,028
Mmm! These tube grubs
are chilled to perfection.

214
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:51,598
Did l say l was finished?

215
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,207
Please, help yourself.

216
00:12:57,247 --> 00:13:01,206
l ran into
your cousin Barbo recently.

217
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:02,809
Barbo? l thought he

218
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:06,482
was still in that
Tarahong detention center.

219
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:08,150
They finally released him.

220
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:09,352
How fortunate.

221
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:11,827
He told me
how the two of you sold

222
00:13:11,862 --> 00:13:14,456
those defective warp drives
to the Tarahong government.

223
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:15,487
Very clever.

224
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:16,897
Oh, it was nothing.

225
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:19,630
The Tarahongians are
an incredibly gullible people.

226
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,694
He also told me

227
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:23,171
how you betrayed him
to the authorities

228
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:26,040
and left him to rot behind bars
while you kept all the profits.

229
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:29,237
The Sixth Rule of Acquisition
expressly states...

230
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,771
''Never allow family to stand
in the way of opportunity.''

231
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:34,340
l certainly never have.

232
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:36,318
You see?

233
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:38,412
l told you he had brains.

234
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:41,686
You've done very well
for yourself, Quark.

235
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:43,022
Not that well.

236
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,358
Don't contradict your elders.

237
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:47,056
lt's impolite.

238
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,724
l suppose
l'm doing quite well at that.

239
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,064
lt was a stroke of brilliance

240
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:55,730
to open a bar so close
to a stable wormhole.

241
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:59,503
He didn't even know
the wormhole existed!

242
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:02,239
That's what makes it
so impressive.

243
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,474
He had the instinct, the ears

244
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:07,780
to make the smart move
before anyone else did.

245
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:11,720
You could learn
from his example.

246
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:16,989
Boy!

247
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:18,551
Boy!

248
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:28,571
Can l go now?

249
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,266
l have homework.

250
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:32,036
Did he say...

251
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:33,372
...homework?

252
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,743
There's a Federation
school here

253
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,511
run by a hu-man, a female.

254
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:46,046
And you allow your son
to attend such a place?

255
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:49,058
Nog, l never want you to
step foot in there again.

256
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:51,185
Now, go to your room.

257
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,957
And no studying.

258
00:14:58,068 --> 00:14:59,399
My apologies, Nagus.

259
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:01,563
lt's those
Federation do-gooders--

260
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:05,632
always sticking their ugly noses
in other people's business.

261
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:08,008
Most distressing.

262
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:10,445
Yes, Nagus, most distressing.

263
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,505
Yes, yes.

264
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,949
Now, speaking of business--

265
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:18,443
Quark, l've come to ask
a favor of you

266
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:21,480
and one that would be
very important to me.

267
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:23,322
l need your bar.

268
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,022
l knew it.

269
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:27,724
And your services as host

270
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:31,723
for an important conference
to be held here tomorrow

271
00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:33,235
at 9:00 sharp.

272
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,966
l would, uh,
consider it a privilege.

273
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:39,305
And the purpose
of this conference is, uh...?

274
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:40,640
The future.

275
00:15:40,677 --> 00:15:44,272
And for Ferengi
business interests

276
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:47,181
the future is already here

277
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:50,983
and its name
is the Gamma Quadrant.

278
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:03,328
Ferengi Transport <i>Sepulo</i>

279
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,665
has put in at Docking Bay 5.

280
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:06,999
That's the third Ferengi ship

281
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,765
to arrive here
in the last 18 hours.

282
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:10,739
Maybe it's Quark's birthday.

283
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:12,799
My advice is to lock
up the silverware.

284
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:14,435
l don't think we have
to go that far.

285
00:16:14,478 --> 00:16:15,536
Sisko to Odo.

286
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:16,944
Go ahead, Commander.

287
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,677
About all of these Ferengi
visitors we've been getting...

288
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,708
l'm already on it.

289
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:31,190
No, no, no!

290
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:32,718
ls something wrong?

291
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:35,527
You can't seat
Turot next to Hoex.

292
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,624
They've been bitter rivals

293
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:40,535
ever since Hoex bought out
Turot's controlling interest

294
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,368
in the cargo ports
on Volchok Prime.

295
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:46,808
Rom! Change these seating
arrangements immediately.

296
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:48,310
Quickly, you fool

297
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:51,246
before l toss you
out the nearest airlock.

298
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:52,748
l thought you understood

299
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:54,546
this was to be
a private meeting.

300
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:55,812
Yes.

301
00:16:57,721 --> 00:16:59,211
Go away!

302
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:00,553
We're closed!

303
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,615
Go away!

304
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:07,226
Shoo! Shoo!

305
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:09,993
What's the delay?

306
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,000
We await the Grand Nagus.

307
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:14,003
Well, he better show
his ears soon

308
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:15,163
or l'm leaving.

309
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:16,832
No one leaves

310
00:17:16,873 --> 00:17:18,841
until the conference
has concluded.

311
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,504
Still hiding
in your father's shadow?

312
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:27,142
The Nagus casts
a very long shadow.

313
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:29,709
Careful you don't
disappear in it!

314
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:31,721
l see we're all here.

315
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,957
Enough drinks.

316
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:36,652
All right, l'm going.

317
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:38,024
Quickly.

318
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:41,394
No, you stay.

319
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,728
Me?

320
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:51,096
Gentlemen, be seated.

321
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,514
Hey, Nog.

322
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,653
Where were you this morning?

323
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:05,154
l'm through with school.

324
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:06,883
What do you mean through?

325
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:10,450
l mean l don't have to attend
those boring classes anymore.

326
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:11,984
ls this your father's idea?

327
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:13,996
lt's the right decision.

328
00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:16,190
Look, if you want,
l'll talk to Mr. O'Brien.

329
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:18,565
No.

330
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:20,695
l don't belong there.

331
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:22,705
Don't you want to learn things?

332
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:25,003
You mean like ethics?

333
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,599
Yeah, and other stuff.

334
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:28,372
You don't understand.

335
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,878
l'm a Ferengi.

336
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:32,404
For me, school is
a waste of time.

337
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:34,007
Why is that?

338
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,211
Because there's no profit in it.

339
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:37,652
So why are you
getting mad at me?

340
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:39,985
Because you're a stupid hu-man

341
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:42,821
and l don't know
why l bother with you.

342
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,019
l'm stupid?

343
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:46,925
You're the one
not going to school.

344
00:18:46,963 --> 00:18:48,863
See if l care.

345
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:53,993
And lastly, l would like
to salute Nava

346
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:57,234
whose takeover of the Arcybite
mining refineries

347
00:18:57,274 --> 00:19:00,038
in the Clarius System
is now complete.

348
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,907
l congratulate you all.

349
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:05,779
Profits are better than ever.

350
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:11,582
Nevertheless, it is becoming
more and more difficult

351
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:14,988
to find truly lucrative
business opportunities

352
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:17,653
here in the Alpha Quadrant.

353
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:19,457
And why?

354
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:24,729
Because no matter where we go
our reputation precedes us--

355
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:29,728
a reputation tainted
by the lies of our competitors

356
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:32,833
who maliciously spread
the erroneous impression

357
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:35,436
that we are not to be trusted.

358
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:44,151
But now, thanks to the discovery
of the wormhole

359
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:49,887
for the first time, we can now
avoid such falsehoods.

360
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:52,759
The Gamma Quadrant, gentlemen--

361
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:56,857
millions of new worlds
at our very doorstep.

362
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,666
The potential
for Ferengi business expansion

363
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:03,571
is staggering.

364
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:06,576
And best of all

365
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,137
no one there has
ever heard the name Ferengi.

366
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,377
Our reputation will be
absolutely stainless.

367
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,044
Our word can be our bond.

368
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,110
Until we decide to break it.

369
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:26,957
lt'll be the good old days
all over again.

370
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:30,057
And who shall lead us
in this great endeavor?

371
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,224
Who else, but my father?

372
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:32,462
The Nagus.

373
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:34,026
The Grand Nagus!
Yes! Yes!

374
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,196
Nagus!

375
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:37,798
l thank you
for your confidence

376
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:41,504
but l must decline the offer.

377
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:42,806
But, Father...

378
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:44,905
l'm old.

379
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:46,643
The fire dims.

380
00:20:46,683 --> 00:20:50,642
l'm just not as greedy
as l used to be.

381
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:52,899
Yes, you are, more so.

382
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:57,162
No, my mind's made up.

383
00:20:57,203 --> 00:21:00,764
l've already chosen
my successor.

384
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:02,001
-Ooh.
-Ooh.

385
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,167
Ahem.

386
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:04,608
A leader

387
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:08,410
whose vision, imagination
and avarice

388
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:12,384
will oversee Ferengi ventures
in the Gamma Quadrant.

389
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:17,219
The new Grand Nagus...

390
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,124
Quark!

391
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,597
He's a lobeless amateur!

392
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,929
Father, have you
lost your mind?

393
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,764
l won't stand for it!

394
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:31,599
This is outrageous!

395
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:42,710
Congratulations.

396
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:46,810
l know you'll do
a wonderful job.

397
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:18,180
Oatmeal lumpy again?

398
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:20,549
No, l'm just not hungry.

399
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:21,883
Want to talk about it?

400
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:23,786
lt's Nog.

401
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:26,883
His father's pulled him
out of school.

402
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:28,359
l see.

403
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:29,884
lt's not fair.

404
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:32,124
Nog can't even read.

405
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:35,134
School's not going
to be much fun without him.

406
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:38,399
You can still get together
with him after school.

407
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:42,272
Maybe. l don't think he wants
to be my friend anymore.

408
00:22:42,308 --> 00:22:43,502
Did he say why?

409
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:46,774
He says humans and Ferengis
don't get along.

410
00:22:46,813 --> 00:22:48,178
Usually they don't.

411
00:22:48,214 --> 00:22:50,011
But you're the one always saying

412
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,813
that we should make friends
with other cultures.

413
00:22:52,852 --> 00:22:55,685
l believe that, and l'm glad
you believe it, too

414
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:58,053
but human values
and Ferengi values

415
00:22:58,091 --> 00:22:59,388
are very different.

416
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,893
We've never been able
to form a common bond.

417
00:23:01,928 --> 00:23:03,896
So Nog goes his way,
and l go mine.

418
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,557
These things happen.

419
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:11,200
Hey, how about after school,
we play a little baseball?

420
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:14,102
l can't.

421
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,540
l have something to do.

422
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:25,013
Grand Nagus Quark.

423
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:26,984
l love the sound of that.

424
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:30,386
l'm afraid we were never
formally introduced.

425
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:32,948
l am Gral,
your new best friend.

426
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,550
You wish to serve me?

427
00:23:34,594 --> 00:23:36,255
l wish to protect you.

428
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:38,024
Protect me?

429
00:23:38,064 --> 00:23:40,658
From those who are jealous
of your position

430
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,793
and wish to take your place.

431
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:45,167
They can be very dangerous.

432
00:23:48,274 --> 00:23:50,469
How do l stop them?

433
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,841
Leave it to me.

434
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:54,540
l'm not going to allow anybody

435
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,516
to harm such a grateful friend
as yourself.

436
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:02,243
How grateful am l?

437
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:05,382
Grateful enough to make sure
that l have my pick

438
00:24:05,424 --> 00:24:08,723
of the most lucrative
Gamma Quadrant opportunities.

439
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:11,457
And if l refuse?

440
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:13,988
You won't.

441
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:28,136
Nagus, l'm
in desperate trouble.

442
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:31,548
So am l-- and please,
call me Zek.

443
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:35,816
Now, which would you choose--
Risa or Balosnee Vl?

444
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:37,322
l don't quite follow.

445
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:39,119
For my vacation.

446
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:42,685
My first in 85 years.

447
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:45,128
l'm told, on Balosnee

448
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:47,394
the soothing harmonies
of the tides

449
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:51,665
can cause the most
stimulating hallucinations

450
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:56,971
but when l think of those
voluptuous Risian females...

451
00:24:57,009 --> 00:24:59,910
Nagus, please...

452
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:01,709
Gral just threatened my life.

453
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:04,375
So he's the first, is he?

454
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:06,078
Well, he won't be the last.

455
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:07,676
But what am l to do?

456
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,312
You picked me
for your successor.

457
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:10,947
Surely, you must have
some advice.

458
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,686
To survive, you must
surround yourself

459
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:15,216
with loyal men.

460
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:16,660
That's good.

461
00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:17,822
But not too loyal.

462
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:21,162
Never trust anyone
who places your prosperity

463
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,326
above their own.

464
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:23,392
l see.

465
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:25,802
And remember, when in doubt,
be ruthless.

466
00:25:25,838 --> 00:25:31,003
Yes. l can do that.

467
00:25:31,077 --> 00:25:32,772
Go on.

468
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:35,807
Zek?

469
00:25:37,183 --> 00:25:38,775
Zek?!

470
00:25:51,764 --> 00:25:54,528
l didn't do anything.

471
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:02,239
l don't know, Krax.

472
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:06,411
20 bars of gold-pressed latinum?

473
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:10,745
Uh... l'll need
to think about it.

474
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:12,273
ln a year, it'll be
worth twice as much.

475
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:14,343
All right, l'll take it.

476
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:17,322
You want me to be
your bodyguard?

477
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:19,824
Think of it as a promotion.

478
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:20,951
But why me?

479
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:24,224
You're the only one left
l can trust.

480
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:26,925
You're my closest associate.

481
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:28,957
My friend, my brother.

482
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:30,468
But l thought...

483
00:26:30,503 --> 00:26:34,166
since you'll be so busy
being Grand Nagus

484
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:37,300
l could take over
running the bar.

485
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:43,282
You-- run my bar?

486
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:55,454
Not exactly overcome by grief,
are we?

487
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:57,792
This is
a private funeral service.

488
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,663
Hmm. You have my sympathies
for your loss.

489
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,794
Nevertheless, when someone
dies on my station

490
00:27:03,836 --> 00:27:07,772
there are questions
that must be answered.

491
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:10,367
There was nothing suspicious
about my father's death.

492
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:12,138
lt was caused
by a massive infection

493
00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:13,406
of the tympanic membrane--

494
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:14,743
a chronic condition.

495
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,407
Then l hope you won't mind

496
00:27:16,449 --> 00:27:19,782
if l ask Dr. Bashir
to examine the body.

497
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,111
That would be difficult.

498
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:24,520
What's this?

499
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:25,717
My piece of Zek.

500
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:28,124
You see, when a Ferengi
of my father's stature dies

501
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,788
the body is automatically
vacuum-desiccated

502
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,846
and sold
as a prized collectible.

503
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:36,114
How touching.

504
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:55,524
-l know there's...
-l wonder...

505
00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:56,694
Go ahead.

506
00:27:56,736 --> 00:27:58,067
lt wasn't important.

507
00:27:58,104 --> 00:28:02,063
l guess humans and Ferengis
don't have a lot to talk about.

508
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:03,905
That's what my father says.

509
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,204
Mine, too.

510
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:07,770
That doesn't mean they're right.

511
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:11,079
We always had stuff
to talk about before.

512
00:28:11,117 --> 00:28:13,176
So, what do you say--

513
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:15,881
you still want to be friends?

514
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:19,555
Yes.

515
00:28:22,462 --> 00:28:26,057
When my father finds out,
he won't be happy.

516
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:27,691
Neither will mine.

517
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:31,033
Come on, l have a great idea.

518
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:32,402
What is it?

519
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:34,134
Come on.

520
00:28:34,174 --> 00:28:39,510
So, what exactly does it mean
becoming Grand Nagus?

521
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:42,447
lt means that, from now on,
if you wish to speak to me

522
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:44,712
you must first make
an appointment with Rom.

523
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:46,309
Don't be ludicrous.

524
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:48,514
lt is also customary
to show respect

525
00:28:48,555 --> 00:28:52,116
by kissing my scepter.

526
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:02,029
l suppose l could make
an exception in your case.

527
00:29:20,787 --> 00:29:23,255
You see the discoloration
around the impact perimeter?

528
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:26,349
These are sorium
and argine traces.

529
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:27,917
Aren't they Ferengi explosives?

530
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:30,622
Exactly. What we have here
is a Ferengi locator bomb

531
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:32,927
designed to lock on
to a target's pheromones.

532
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:34,796
You mean they're
attracted to body odor?

533
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:37,359
Mm-hmm. Very deadly
and very accurate.

534
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:39,838
lf Quark hadn't lowered
his head at the last second...

535
00:29:39,873 --> 00:29:41,704
-Commander.
-Yes, Doctor?

536
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:43,936
l've just given Quark
a thorough examination.

537
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,705
He's a bit shaken
up, nothing more.

538
00:29:45,745 --> 00:29:48,509
l guess it's time
to have a little chat

539
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:50,106
with the Grand Nagus.

540
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,742
l'd be delighted.

541
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:03,958
When are you
going to get it through

542
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:05,827
your twisted
little brain that we

543
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:07,856
are trying to save your life?

544
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:10,131
You're trying to interfere
in Ferengi affairs of state.

545
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,467
Which are none of your concern.

546
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:13,199
Now, look here, Quark...

547
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:16,367
Uh-uh-uh-- Grand Nagus Quark.

548
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:19,378
Those locator bombs
are damn near foolproof.

549
00:30:19,412 --> 00:30:20,572
You were lucky once.

550
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:22,581
Next time, we could be
scraping you off the walls.

551
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:25,880
The Grand Nagus does not ask
for help from outsiders.

552
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,888
l'm sure whoever tried to kill
you is counting on that.

553
00:30:28,922 --> 00:30:30,651
You must have some suspicion
who that could be.

554
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,123
l'm suspicious of everybody.

555
00:30:32,158 --> 00:30:33,284
But who would you say

556
00:30:33,326 --> 00:30:35,692
stands to benefit
the most from your death?

557
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:37,855
Let's see.

558
00:30:37,897 --> 00:30:39,660
That would have to be Krax.

559
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:41,428
Yes, if anything
were to happen to me

560
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:42,833
Krax becomes Nagus.

561
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:45,565
True, but let's not forget that
it was Gral who threatened you.

562
00:30:46,706 --> 00:30:48,003
Threatened you?

563
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,099
How?

564
00:30:49,142 --> 00:30:51,133
That's none of your concern.

565
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:54,305
Besides, Gral and Krax
were at the funeral

566
00:30:54,347 --> 00:30:56,315
when the bomb went off

567
00:30:56,349 --> 00:31:00,649
which means that neither one
of them could have set it.

568
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:03,656
Whoever planned this could
have had an accomplice.

569
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,387
You're sure all of Zek's
associates attended the funeral?

570
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:09,292
Yes, yes, they were all there.

571
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:10,921
Look, this is getting us
nowhere.

572
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:12,522
What about Zek's servant?

573
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:13,930
You mean Maihar'du?

574
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:15,264
What about him?

575
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:16,859
Was he at the funeral?

576
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:18,803
l don't recall
seeing him there.

577
00:31:18,838 --> 00:31:19,805
Do you?

578
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,739
Now that you mention it--

579
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:23,105
no, l don't.

580
00:31:24,777 --> 00:31:26,142
lnteresting.

581
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,147
Hupyrian servants are renowned

582
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:30,615
for their devotion
to their employers.

583
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,551
For Maihar'du
not to have shown up

584
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:36,521
at Zek's funeral
is very odd indeed.

585
00:31:45,064 --> 00:31:47,828
You were out pretty
late last night.

586
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:49,232
l was?

587
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:51,237
You came in after midnight.

588
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:54,434
Uh... l guess l got
kind of busy doing stuff.

589
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:55,998
What kind of stuff?

590
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:58,009
Nothing important,
just hanging around.

591
00:31:58,077 --> 00:31:59,374
With Nog.

592
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:01,380
We weren't doing anything wrong.

593
00:32:01,414 --> 00:32:03,439
Good. Then you can
tell me all about it.

594
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,709
l can't.

595
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:10,052
lt's private.

596
00:32:10,089 --> 00:32:12,489
Private?

597
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:17,121
l got to go,
or l'll be late for school.

598
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:18,824
l want you home
in time for dinner.

599
00:32:18,865 --> 00:32:19,854
Understood?

600
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:23,968
Understood.

601
00:32:31,144 --> 00:32:34,170
The thing is, uh... Nagus

602
00:32:34,214 --> 00:32:40,119
l feel l've done all l can
in the field of gouge mining.

603
00:32:40,153 --> 00:32:42,553
You wish to find profit
elsewhere?

604
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:43,886
Yes, Nagus.

605
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:46,551
Where would that be?

606
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:49,153
l'd like the chance

607
00:32:49,195 --> 00:32:53,325
to introduce synthehol
to the Gamma Quadrant.

608
00:32:53,366 --> 00:32:58,998
A very lucrative opportunity.

609
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,471
Tell me, Nava

610
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:05,773
when Zek announced
l was to succeed him

611
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:07,177
were you pleased?

612
00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:12,048
Uh... no, Nagus.

613
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:16,986
Did you come to me
and offer your support?

614
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:21,652
No, Nagus.

615
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:25,727
Yet now you call me Nagus

616
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:28,734
but is it
out of true friendship?

617
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:32,727
No, you only pretend
to show me respect

618
00:33:32,772 --> 00:33:36,469
so l will grant you
this immense opportunity.

619
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:39,501
Which l'm willing
to split with you-- 50-50?

620
00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:41,513
Well, in that case

621
00:33:41,547 --> 00:33:44,539
let's hope the Gamma Quadrant
develops a taste for synthehol.

622
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:47,845
Oh, yes.

623
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:53,456
A very smart deal, Nagus.

624
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:56,894
l seem to have
a knack for it, don't l?

625
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:58,294
Yes, Nagus.

626
00:33:58,331 --> 00:34:01,494
The rest will have
to come back tomorrow.

627
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:03,764
All this benevolence wearies me.

628
00:34:03,803 --> 00:34:05,168
Yes, Nagus.

629
00:34:05,204 --> 00:34:06,762
As you wish, Nagus.

630
00:34:06,806 --> 00:34:09,570
l think
l'll head over to the bar

631
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:10,940
and check the receipts.

632
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,409
-Yes, Nagus.
-Yes, Nagus.

633
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:22,181
lf he keeps handing out
these choice opportunities

634
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:25,850
he's going to become
very popular.

635
00:34:25,892 --> 00:34:29,658
We'll just have to come up
with a new plan.

636
00:34:29,696 --> 00:34:33,860
Something more reliable
than a locator bomb.

637
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,926
Something that
can't possibly fail

638
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,733
to kill my dear brother.

639
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,689
Come in.

640
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,765
l was going to ask you

641
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,601
to join me in a round
of Jokarian chess

642
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,164
but l can see you're just
sitting down to dinner.

643
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,505
l sat down half an hour ago

644
00:35:02,543 --> 00:35:04,773
about the time Jake
was supposed to be home.

645
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:07,576
Aubergine stew.

646
00:35:07,614 --> 00:35:09,343
Looks delicious.

647
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:11,044
So, where's Jake?

648
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:12,245
Where else?

649
00:35:12,286 --> 00:35:13,776
With Nog.

650
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,813
Going through my own adolescence
was difficult enough.

651
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:19,121
Surviving my son's
is going to take a miracle.

652
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:22,390
Maybe it's time you had
a little talk with Jake.

653
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:24,989
Children need to know
their boundaries.

654
00:35:25,032 --> 00:35:26,329
l should know.

655
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:28,357
l've been a mother three times
and a father twice.

656
00:35:28,402 --> 00:35:30,097
Which was easier?

657
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:33,629
Actually, l wasn't
very successful either way

658
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:37,474
so... feel free to reject
what l'm about to say

659
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:39,911
but if l were you,
l would go find Jake

660
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:42,504
and bring him here
to eat his dinner.

661
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:44,483
You would?

662
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,247
Absolutely.

663
00:35:50,624 --> 00:35:52,922
Computer, locate Jake Sisko.

664
00:35:52,993 --> 00:35:56,156
Jake Sisko is in Cargo Bay 14.

665
00:35:57,464 --> 00:35:59,398
Thanks, old man.

666
00:36:09,843 --> 00:36:12,676
...are four...
teen, fourteen...

667
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:13,680
''Planets...''

668
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:19,744
''...planets
in the Bajoran s...''

669
00:36:19,787 --> 00:36:22,255
What's that word?

670
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:24,553
''System.''

671
00:36:24,591 --> 00:36:26,252
''System.''

672
00:36:26,293 --> 00:36:28,056
That was pretty good.

673
00:36:28,095 --> 00:36:30,620
Want to try some more?

674
00:36:30,664 --> 00:36:32,723
''The lar...

675
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:38,227
''largest planet is Bajor.

676
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:42,538
''lt has... three...

677
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:43,873
moons?''

678
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,242
You got it!

679
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,476
Keep going, keep going.

680
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:50,813
Okay.

681
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:53,843
''The third... moon...

682
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:55,354
it has...''

683
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,187
You clumsy idiot.

684
00:36:58,225 --> 00:36:59,852
You want to strangle me?

685
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:01,190
My apologies, Nagus.

686
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:02,354
Stop daydreaming.

687
00:37:02,396 --> 00:37:04,193
Pay attention to your work.

688
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:05,528
Yes, Nagus.

689
00:37:05,566 --> 00:37:06,863
When do we leave?

690
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,198
Just as soon
as you're ready, Nagus.

691
00:37:09,236 --> 00:37:11,363
l've always wanted
to take a trip

692
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:12,838
through the wormhole.

693
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:14,101
Still, it's odd...

694
00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:15,438
Zek never mentioned

695
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:17,875
that he'd traveled
to the Gamma Quadrant

696
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:20,742
let alone opened negotiations
with one of its worlds.

697
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:23,409
Negotiations that you will have
the honor of completing.

698
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,610
According to Krax

699
00:37:24,651 --> 00:37:27,814
Stakoron ll contains
rich deposits of mizainite ore.

700
00:37:27,855 --> 00:37:30,153
A very lucrative opportunity.

701
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,885
Quark?

702
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:34,223
What now?

703
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:36,855
About the bar...

704
00:37:36,897 --> 00:37:40,833
you have so much,
and l have so little...

705
00:37:40,868 --> 00:37:44,360
Which is exactly
how it was meant to be.

706
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:47,673
Come.

707
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:51,041
Let's not keep
our new partners waiting.

708
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,157
May l say, Nagus,
that my father himself

709
00:38:10,197 --> 00:38:12,165
never looked more commanding.

710
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,496
l've been thinking

711
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:15,000
maybe it would be wise

712
00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:17,333
to take a dabo girl along
with us.

713
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:18,668
Whatever for?

714
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:22,664
A pretty woman by my side
would only add to my prestige.

715
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:24,006
Never underestimate

716
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:26,512
the importance
of a first impression.

717
00:38:26,546 --> 00:38:28,844
One look
at your imposing features

718
00:38:28,882 --> 00:38:30,850
and the Stakoron negotiators

719
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:34,843
will give us
everything we ask for.

720
00:38:34,888 --> 00:38:36,879
All right.

721
00:38:36,924 --> 00:38:39,825
lf you really think
l won't need her...

722
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,987
Believe me, you won't.

723
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:43,690
Shall we?

724
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,888
This is an historic moment.

725
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,896
Nagus.

726
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,574
There must be some mistake.

727
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,379
There's no ship docked here.

728
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,976
Wait!

729
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:40,987
Rom, you idiot!

730
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:44,889
Krax, what are you
standing there for?

731
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:48,826
What's the matter with you two?

732
00:39:48,862 --> 00:39:50,989
Open the door!

733
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:53,761
Do you hear me?!

734
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,290
Open up!

735
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,997
You must obey your Nagus!

736
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,134
Sorry, Quark, but you've just
been voted out of office.

737
00:40:03,176 --> 00:40:03,543
Rom!

738
00:40:03,543 --> 00:40:05,340
Rom!

739
00:40:05,379 --> 00:40:07,279
Brother!

740
00:40:07,314 --> 00:40:09,043
Please!

741
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:13,610
So, you were going
to toss me out an airlock.

742
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:16,349
l never meant it.

743
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,857
Well, l do.

744
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:19,688
''Rom's.''

745
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:22,456
Nice name for a bar,
don't you think?

746
00:40:22,496 --> 00:40:23,793
Enough talk.

747
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,422
Let's get this started.

748
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,763
Would you like
to do the honors?

749
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:29,632
Or should l?

750
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:31,296
Let me out!

751
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:37,739
Let me out of here!

752
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:41,810
Please...

753
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,142
Release him!

754
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:46,882
Nagus!

755
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,717
-You're alive!
-You're alive!

756
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:53,893
Well, Quark

757
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:56,896
looks like you needed
my help after all.

758
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,398
Don't you recognize your father?

759
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,025
You died.

760
00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:03,002
l saw it happen.

761
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:05,470
You saw me enter
a Dolbargy sleeping trance.

762
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:06,904
Maihar'du taught it to me.

763
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,133
But why, Father?

764
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:09,665
lt was a test

765
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:13,270
to see if you were
ready to take my place

766
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:16,305
and you failed... miserably!

767
00:41:18,378 --> 00:41:20,539
But, Father, l am ready.

768
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,514
l am ready.

769
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:24,107
You saw for yourself

770
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:25,880
l was about to grab power!

771
00:41:25,952 --> 00:41:27,510
You don't grab power.

772
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:31,115
You accumulate it quietly
without anyone noticing.

773
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:32,785
But l don't understand.

774
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:34,453
The bar, you fool.

775
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:35,893
That was the key.

776
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:37,556
All those visitors stopping by

777
00:41:37,597 --> 00:41:40,157
on their way
to and from the wormhole.

778
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,169
You could have sat there quietly
at your leisure

779
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:45,831
and gathered up
all the information you needed

780
00:41:45,872 --> 00:41:47,169
about the Gamma Quadrant.

781
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:48,333
What about him?

782
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,003
Oh, you could have let him
hold the scepter

783
00:41:51,044 --> 00:41:53,342
while you controlled everything
from the shadows.

784
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,507
And then, when everything
was running smoothly

785
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:57,676
only then would you take over.

786
00:41:57,718 --> 00:41:59,015
But, Father...

787
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:01,043
No! l'm not interested
in excuses!

788
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:02,680
Go back to the ship.

789
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:04,850
We'll be leaving here shortly.

790
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:06,358
Yes, Father.

791
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:07,860
lt's like...

792
00:42:07,894 --> 00:42:10,692
it's like talking to a Klingon.

793
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:18,568
l guess this
still belongs to you.

794
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:20,072
Yes.

795
00:42:20,107 --> 00:42:23,304
lt looks like l'll have
to remain Grand Nagus

796
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:26,540
long enough to establish
a Ferengi presence

797
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,047
in the Gamma Quadrant.

798
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:32,040
And l was really looking
forward to retirement.

799
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:34,883
lf l hear of any good
Gamma Quadrant deals

800
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:37,389
you'd be right for,
l'll let you know.

801
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:39,153
You know where to find me.

802
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:41,717
You've done a very
profitable job

803
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:43,229
with this place.

804
00:42:43,263 --> 00:42:45,731
Who knows, maybe one day

805
00:42:45,766 --> 00:42:48,599
l'll come back
and buy it from you.

806
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:57,569
So, Rom...

807
00:42:57,611 --> 00:43:00,705
you were going to toss
me out an airlock.

808
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:04,076
Forgive me, brother.

809
00:43:04,117 --> 00:43:05,414
Forgive you?!

810
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:07,079
Why, brother...

811
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,817
l didn't think
you had the lobes.

812
00:43:10,857 --> 00:43:14,190
Such wonderful treachery
deserves a reward.

813
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:15,785
l'm going to make you
the assistant manager

814
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:18,059
of policy and clientele
here at Quark's.

815
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:20,328
What exactly does that mean?

816
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:21,857
How should l know?

817
00:43:21,902 --> 00:43:23,369
l just made it up.

818
00:43:23,403 --> 00:43:25,735
Come on, l'll buy you a drink.

819
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,138
So what time tomorrow?

820
00:43:29,176 --> 00:43:32,168
How about as soon
as you get out of school?

821
00:43:35,749 --> 00:43:37,876
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

822
00:43:44,024 --> 00:43:45,685
Jake.

823
00:43:47,861 --> 00:43:49,351
Dad.

824
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:53,099
What are you doing here?

825
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:55,795
l was waiting for you.

826
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:04,503
Dad...

827
00:44:04,544 --> 00:44:07,536
You're a great boy,
you know that?

828
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:12,549
Now go be with your friend.
