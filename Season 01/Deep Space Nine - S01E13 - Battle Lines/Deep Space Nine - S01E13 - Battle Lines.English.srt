1
00:00:02,427 --> 00:00:04,725
What's funny is where
the files were located--

2
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:06,162
right there in Ops protocols.

3
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:08,733
The encryption system
was extremely easy to break.

4
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:10,496
So, they wanted us
to find these?

5
00:00:10,535 --> 00:00:12,127
Or they didn't care.

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,434
Well, there's nothing
of strategic value here--

7
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,442
just some personal logs

8
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,637
and some files
on Bajoran terrorists

9
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:22,374
but it is a glimpse
into the Cardassian mind.

10
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:25,178
You might want to warn Kira
before she sees her file.

11
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:26,979
Warn me?
About what?

12
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,987
Oh, uh...

13
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:30,613
Dax and Mr. O'Brien

14
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:34,319
discovered some of the last
Prefect's personal files.

15
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:36,190
There's a file on you

16
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:38,388
but you may find it
disappointing.

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,988
l'm a big girl, Commander.

18
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:54,612
Bashir to Sisko.

19
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:55,670
Sisko here.

20
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:57,045
l'm at Airlock 14, Commander.

21
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:58,447
l think you better
get down here.

22
00:00:58,483 --> 00:00:59,780
What's the problem, Doctor?

23
00:00:59,818 --> 00:01:01,752
Well, l was about to begin
off-loading

24
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:04,347
some medical specimens
from the Bajoran transport

25
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:05,856
and, well...

26
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:08,359
the Kai is here.

27
00:01:08,393 --> 00:01:10,293
Kai... Opaka.

28
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,354
Why would she be here?

29
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:16,333
She said you once offered her
a tour of the station.

30
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:20,864
''A minor operative

31
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:23,272
''whose activities are limited
to running errands

32
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:24,707
for the terrorist leaders''?!

33
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:27,439
Major, when you're through
feeling underappreciated

34
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,642
perhaps you'd join me
in welcoming the Kai aboard.

35
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:49,566
You say she's never
been here before?

36
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,967
She's never even left
Bajor before.

37
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:54,563
Well, excuse me
for saying so, Commander

38
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:57,871
but she looks... preoccupied.

39
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,921
ls something wrong, Opaka?

40
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,483
Contemplating prophecy.

41
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:21,161
lt's interesting you
chose this viewport.

42
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,565
The wormhole is just out there.

43
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,968
lt's a spectacular sight to see.

44
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:28,336
Unfortunately,
it can only be seen

45
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:30,534
when a ship enters it or exits

46
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:33,373
but there's nothing
scheduled for today.

47
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:35,004
A shame.

48
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:41,577
Sisko to O'Brien.

49
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,985
Go ahead, Commander.

50
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:45,114
Prepare the <i>Yangtzee Kiang</i>
for launch, Chief.

51
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:48,615
Kira and l are taking
the Kai through the wormhole.

52
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,957
Right away, sir.

53
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:51,326
Thank you.

54
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:58,097
l didn't want to keep you
from your duties, Doctor.

55
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,626
Oh, it's a slow day.

56
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:00,968
All right.

57
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:02,268
This way.

58
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:20,749
ls the ship ready, Chief?

59
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,350
All prepped
and ready for departure

60
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:23,361
Commander.

61
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:24,362
Ma'am.

62
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:25,954
After you.

63
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:34,929
You have a child, don't you?

64
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,167
l do.

65
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:38,299
l have a little girl, ma'am.

66
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,640
Yes.

67
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:47,545
Would you give this
to her for me?

68
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,309
We'll be entering the wormhole
in about a minute.

69
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,216
Thank you again
for indulging me.

70
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,481
Not at all, Opaka.

71
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,751
You honor us with your presence.

72
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,451
<i>Yangtzee Kiang</i> to DS9.

73
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,052
Estimated time of return,
1400 hours.

74
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,823
Logged in.
We'll expect you then.

75
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,798
Flight stabilization at maximum.

76
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,802
Here we go.

77
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,082
Spectacular, isn't it?

78
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,951
More than l imagined.

79
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:05,015
My smoothest ride yet, Major.

80
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,491
There's ldran,
the closest system.

81
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,257
lt's a ternary star.

82
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,025
A doorway into the unknown.

83
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:13,659
The other side
of the galaxy, to be precise.

84
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:16,499
The Gamma Quadrant is 70,000
light years from Bajor.

85
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:19,005
lt would take
our fastest starship

86
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,030
over 67 years to get here.

87
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,508
l'm glad l got the chance
to see it.

88
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,637
You'll be seeing
what this wormhole

89
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,738
is worth to Bajor
in a few years.

90
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,977
lf that is to be my fate,
Commander.

91
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,351
Should l reverse course?

92
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,514
So soon?

93
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:39,151
There's not much else
to show you yet.

94
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,388
Prophecy can often be vague,
Commander.

95
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,555
That's why we must test it.

96
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,799
l don't understand, Opaka.

97
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,903
You may return.

98
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,535
Take us back
to the wormhole, Major.

99
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,010
Coming about.

100
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:01,845
Sensors are picking up
a narrow band subspace signal.

101
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,213
What do you make of it?

102
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,344
Just a long stream
of statistical data

103
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:09,185
followed by a request
for a reply.

104
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,851
Uh, l'm not reading
any response.

105
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,019
Launch a class-2 probe.
We'll follow it up later.

106
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,926
You're not going
to investigate it now?

107
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,261
l'm not sure that's a good idea.

108
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:19,926
Because of my presence?

109
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,730
Well, there's no telling
what it may be.

110
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,732
Please, Commander.

111
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,674
l don't get out often.

112
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:34,236
Can you get a fix
on the source, Major?

113
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:38,809
.35 light years,
bearing 229, mark 41.

114
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:44,147
l guess we'd better take a look.

115
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,026
Well, this is definitely
the origin of the signal.

116
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:57,037
l'm having trouble
pinpointing the source.

117
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:59,631
lt's not coming
from the surface.

118
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,204
There's your answer.

119
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,236
A network
of artificial satellites.

120
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,148
One of them looks like
it's malfunctioning.

121
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:11,981
lts orbit is unstable.

122
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,112
l'd bet the signals we picked up

123
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,588
were from the system
trying to repair it.

124
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:19,593
Commander,
sensors indicate life-forms

125
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:22,187
localized
in 12 square kilometers

126
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,958
on the moon's surface.

127
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:26,023
They may be humanoid, sir.

128
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,896
Humanoid?
Can you verify that?

129
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,199
l can't resolve
the bio-patterns.

130
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,262
There's too much interference.

131
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,831
Take us in a little closer.

132
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,140
We're being scanned
by one of the satellites.

133
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,442
l don't like this.

134
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:41,846
lt's heading toward us.

135
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,941
Shields up.

136
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,781
Reading a massive energy buildup
in the satellite.

137
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,186
600 megawatts... 900.

138
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:50,281
lt's firing.

139
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,827
Shields are down.

140
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:57,660
Forward thrusters are gone.
We're losing power.

141
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,064
Attempting to compensate
with secondary boosters.

142
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,431
lmpulse generator's failing.

143
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,663
Hold on, we're going down.

144
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:07,367
Check contingency
fuel cell output.

145
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:09,171
Holding at 65%.

146
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,233
Doctor...

147
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,074
-watch the hull temperature.
-Aye, sir.

148
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,272
Stabilizing attitude
control response.

149
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,838
Pitching up to 20 degrees.

150
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:17,510
Hull temperature 900 C.

151
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,610
950, 1,100.

152
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,416
We're holding profile.

153
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,922
1,200 C, 13...

154
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,924
Ejecting antimatter pod.

155
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,358
Pitching up to 60 degrees.

156
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,624
Prepare for final
braking maneuvers.

157
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,358
Brace for impact.

158
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,784
Commander...

159
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,595
Pulmonary collapse.

160
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,496
Her upper thoracic vertebrae
have been crushed.

161
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,090
Stay with us, Opaka.
Stay with us.

162
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,637
l'm sorry.

163
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:21,537
<i>Ahn-kay ya...</i>

164
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:26,638
<i>ay-ya vasu.</i>

165
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,843
<i>Coh-ma-ra...</i>

00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,818

<i>Ahn-kay ya...</i>

00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,084
<i>ay-ya vasu.</i>

169
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,091
We've got company.

170
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,300
Still no contact with Sisko?

171
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,570
Not yet.

172
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,578
They're nearly
three hours overdue.

173
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,239
Three and a half.

174
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,340
Opaka's people are on subspace
to me every five minutes.

175
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,907
Tell them
one of our runabouts

176
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,886
found a trace
of a warp eddy current.

177
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,547
lt's got to be
from their ship.

178
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:10,216
With any luck, we should
be able to determine

179
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,519
which direction
they were headed.

180
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,185
That's not going
to satisfy them on Bajor.

181
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:15,617
You have no idea
what the Kai means to them.

182
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,685
When they heard Sisko had
taken her into the wormhole...

183
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,950
Constable, tell them we're
doing the best we can, okay?

184
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:22,616
Runabout Pad C.

185
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:26,354
Have the Bajorans station
a ship on the Gamma side.

186
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:29,591
We'll stay in close touch
by subspace.

187
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:35,602
Move.

188
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:44,068
Our first visitors.

189
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:46,807
You're not all the same race.

190
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:48,816
l'm a Bajoran.

191
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,784
l'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.

192
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:53,686
Major Kira Nerys
and Doctor Julian Bashir.

193
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:55,485
A doctor?

194
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:58,725
How ironic.

195
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,354
l'm Golin Shel-la,
leader of the Ennis.

196
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:02,761
Why are you here?

197
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:05,357
We were attacked
by one of your satellites

198
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,027
Our ship was damaged,
and we crashed.

199
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:10,970
Of course, Commander,
but why did you come here?

200
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:12,302
We were exploring.

201
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,274
We recently discovered
a permanent wormhole

202
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:16,834
linking our quadrant
of the galaxy with yours.

203
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:19,676
l command a space station at
the mouth of that wormhole.

204
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:21,944
You know nothing
of our home planet?

205
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:24,178
You know nothing
of the punishment?

206
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:26,949
We're just beginning
to explore this sector.

207
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:29,149
As l said, our home is on
the other side of the gal...

208
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:31,158
Major.

209
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:32,159
l'm all right.

210
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:33,182
The hell you are.

211
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,061
She needs treatment.

212
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:42,433
l'd like my medical case

213
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,803
if you don't mind.

214
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:04,247
For God's sake!

215
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:11,031
l apologize
for our cautious nature.

216
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:13,124
lf you haven't realized,
we're at war.

217
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:14,567
Who are you fighting?

218
00:15:14,602 --> 00:15:18,538
A brutal enemy
that attacks at whim.

219
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:21,565
We maintain a constant vigil.

220
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:23,736
This is an energy weapon.

221
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:25,245
Yes.

222
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,443
The Ennis stopped using
directed-energy weapons

223
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,041
centuries ago--

224
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,778
not damaging enough.

225
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:37,754
Your arrival
complicates matters.

226
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,726
We don't plan to be here long.

227
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:41,752
Oh, you expect
to repair your ship?

228
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:45,391
No, but a rescue team is
probably on its way right now.

229
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:46,525
Well, like you

230
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:48,297
they'll have to deal
with the defense-net

231
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:49,701
and that is beyond my influence.

232
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:51,534
You don't control
the satellites?

233
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:54,371
We're all prisoners
on this moon.

234
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:56,809
Then, this is a penal colony.

235
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:59,939
My immediate concern
is your partisanship.

236
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,380
By your very presence here

237
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,008
you'll be considered
our allies.

238
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:05,451
All your lives are in danger.

239
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:10,683
The latest victims
of our enemy--

240
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:12,124
the Nol-Ennis.

241
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,889
Where are your doctors?

242
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:15,395
We have none.

243
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,523
You have no medical personnel?

244
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:18,998
How do you survive without...?

245
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,728
We were thrust
into this situation

246
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:22,030
with few resources.

247
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:24,001
Since you're here
under similar circumstances

248
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:26,097
l was hoping we'd be
of some help to each other.

249
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:32,777
This should make you
feel better.

250
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:41,745
Major...

251
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,654
l'm so sorry.

252
00:16:46,694 --> 00:16:49,458
l would have done anything.

253
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,264
lt's all so senseless.

254
00:16:57,238 --> 00:17:00,730
Opaka's always been
a symbol of hope to me.

255
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,743
Her words gave
our struggle meaning.

256
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,218
And now she's dead.

257
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:16,413
Her life ends
on some unknown moon...

258
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,251
and for what?

259
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:24,857
Dr. Bashir will give you
any medical assistance he can

260
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:28,300
but understand, we can't
take sides in your battle.

261
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:30,600
lt doesn't matter
what l understand

262
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:32,538
if the Nol capture you.

263
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:35,303
We're in the middle
of a pretty ugly war.

264
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:36,833
l gathered that.

265
00:17:36,878 --> 00:17:39,039
Shel-la says his people
will protect us from the enemy

266
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,344
in exchange for your services.

267
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:43,043
Well, perhaps l can
train some of them

268
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,381
in the basics of field triage.

269
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:45,386
Do whatever you can.

270
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,785
How's the shoulder, Major?

271
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:48,220
l'll live.

272
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:50,053
l still have to run
a neuromuscular scan

273
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:51,217
on her when we get back.

274
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:53,420
Don't count on a quick rescue.

275
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,986
This moon is some kind
of high-security prison colony.

276
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:16,081
Over here!
Over here!

277
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,281
Major!

278
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:34,958
Let's go!

279
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:36,197
Leave him!

280
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:37,465
Run!

281
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:03,159
Commander!

282
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:09,737
Put your phaser down, Kira.

283
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:36,289
Her vital signs
appear to be normal

284
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,321
but l could have sworn
she was...

285
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:40,027
l... l was there, Doctor.

286
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:41,262
Opaka...

287
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:43,031
are you aware of what happened?

288
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:50,205
The surface was approaching
so quickly.

289
00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:52,041
l must admit, l...

290
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:54,706
l closed my eyes, Commander.

291
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:57,547
There was a deafening whine.

292
00:19:57,585 --> 00:20:00,816
l felt the impact.

293
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:04,188
A wall of heat seemed to...

294
00:20:04,225 --> 00:20:05,988
pass through me.

295
00:20:08,362 --> 00:20:10,626
And... and then...

296
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:15,160
nothing.

297
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:18,285
After we crashed,
we pulled you from the wreckage

298
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,888
but you were...

299
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:21,922
Dead.

300
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:41,743
How do you explain this, Doctor?

301
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:43,686
Although she appears
to be normal

302
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:45,883
her physiology
has been radically altered.

303
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:46,913
How?

304
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,050
l'm not sure.

305
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,751
The tricorder indicates
some kind

306
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:52,058
of biomechanical presence
at a cellular level.

307
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:54,222
Biomechanical?
You mean something artificial?

308
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:55,858
l wish l could tell you.

309
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,595
Whatever it is, it seems to be

310
00:20:57,636 --> 00:21:00,264
directly controlling
her metabolic processes.

311
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:01,863
ls she in any danger?

312
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:03,840
l'm sorry to keep saying it,
Commander

313
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,708
but l really don't know.

314
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:09,942
lf the runabout's computer
were functional

315
00:21:09,981 --> 00:21:13,781
l might be able to run
a full analysis.

316
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:15,445
Commander.

317
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:17,114
Over here.

318
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:31,031
lt's okay.
lt's all right.

319
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:49,014
There's still no sign of them

320
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:51,045
on any
of the long-range scanners.

321
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:53,283
Not even a transponder signal.

322
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:55,225
lf they went down,
we should at least

323
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,592
be getting something
from their transponder.

324
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:00,655
The warp eddy has traces
of meson particle emissions.

325
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:02,667
That makes it
a Starfleet power reactor.

326
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:04,794
The current shows
that their heading

327
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:06,667
was approximately 230 mark 4.

328
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:08,502
Anything interesting
in that direction?

329
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,475
An uncharted binary star system.

330
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:14,603
Well,
l guess it's time to chart it.

331
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:17,740
Setting a new course.

332
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:23,914
His readings are
the same as Opaka's.

333
00:22:23,955 --> 00:22:25,752
Virtually every cell
in his body

334
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,520
shows signs
of this biomechanical presence.

335
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,858
Now, somehow, it has literally
brought him back to life.

336
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:32,453
You died before?

337
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:34,897
Many times, too many to count.

338
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:37,197
Sir, l'd like to return
to the runabout

339
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:40,227
and try and get the computer
up and running.

340
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:42,466
Doctor, we're in the middle
of a war.

341
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:43,906
Sir, this could be
a breakthrough

342
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:45,170
of unprecedented magnitude.

343
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,643
lt's too dangerous.

344
00:22:46,678 --> 00:22:48,839
l'll see to his protection.

345
00:23:00,992 --> 00:23:05,258
l would like to know more about
this ''breakthrough'' myself.

346
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:08,595
Your doctor acts as though
he's seen a miracle.

347
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:10,260
He's not alone.

348
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:13,236
Well, if you'd lived
with it as we have

349
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:15,762
you'd see it as a curse.

350
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:17,934
How long have you been here?

351
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:20,467
lt feels like an eternity.

352
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:23,447
lt's all part of the punishment.

353
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:27,440
What is this punishment,
Shel-la?

354
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:31,114
Everything here is designed
to prolong our suffering.

355
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:33,124
What was your crime?

356
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:39,393
The Ennis and the Nol-Ennis
are ancient enemies.

357
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:44,300
Generation after generation,
we fought the same war.

358
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:47,793
The leaders of our planet
were unable to mediate a peace.

359
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,034
Finally, they sent us all here

360
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:52,770
and told us that we would serve
as an example

361
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:54,676
for the rest of civilization.

362
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:58,942
How did your fight begin?

363
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,987
Some say it was water.

364
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:04,989
Some say it was land.

365
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,287
lt's not really
very relevant now.

366
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:09,691
Then what do you hope to gain
by continuing?

367
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:11,251
Vengeance.

368
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:14,424
All of us have seen
our families suffer incredibly

369
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:16,263
at the hands of the Nol.

370
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:18,166
The Nol can say
the very same thing.

371
00:24:18,203 --> 00:24:19,693
And probably do.

372
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:22,137
lf you must fight your war,
the least you can do

373
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:23,765
is learn to fight it
more effectively.

374
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,775
Major, this is not our...

375
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:26,174
What do you mean?

376
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,475
There were no guards
at the entrance when we arrived.

377
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:31,505
You have no system to alert
your forces of an attack.

378
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:33,278
Your people are obviously
unprepared

379
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:34,751
for fighting close-quartered.

380
00:24:34,786 --> 00:24:35,753
That's enough, Major.

381
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:37,118
We're trapped on this moon

382
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:38,747
with only his forces
between us and damnation.

383
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,621
We have to defend
ourselves to stay alive.

384
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:42,455
Now, when the Nol
attack again, we...

385
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:43,461
l said that's enough!

386
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:45,258
We have to be ready!

387
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:47,264
This is not your war, Kira.

388
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:53,568
We used to defend
ourselves better, Major.

389
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:56,267
Safety perimeters,
counterattacks

390
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:58,070
preemptive strikes.

391
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:02,913
And then we realized...

392
00:25:02,947 --> 00:25:06,075
that it was all pointless.

393
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:14,987
When you cease to fear death,
the rules of war change.

394
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:18,995
You'll understand as the years
begin to pass, Major.

395
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:21,827
Listen to me, Shel-la.

396
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:24,858
Our rescue is not going
to take years.

397
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:27,895
Days, weeks, maybe,
but they will find us

398
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:30,669
and then they'll penetrate
the defense-net

399
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,869
and transport us out of here.

400
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:36,005
Then you will be luckier
than we have been.

401
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:39,447
We'd be willing to transport
all of you away from here

402
00:25:39,484 --> 00:25:41,281
if that's what you want.

403
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:47,284
Away from here?

404
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:49,259
To live one life

405
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:52,263
to die in peace...

406
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:54,925
to us, this is
an ancient prayer

407
00:25:54,966 --> 00:25:57,764
that has never been
answered, Commander.

408
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:03,574
You would do this for us?

409
00:26:03,608 --> 00:26:04,905
For both sides--

410
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:06,934
the Ennis and the Nol-Ennis.

411
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:08,411
After you leave

412
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:10,710
you can go wherever you want,
but end this nightmare.

413
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:12,443
Stop fighting long enough

414
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:14,713
for all of us
to get off this moon.

415
00:26:14,752 --> 00:26:16,720
Zlangco, the leader of the Nol

416
00:26:16,754 --> 00:26:18,346
would never agree
to a cease-fire.

417
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:19,356
Ask him.

418
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,357
You don't know them!

419
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:21,483
All they care about is...

420
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:22,720
What do you care about?

421
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,990
lf you want to end
the suffering of your people

422
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:27,657
then at least try.

423
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:29,530
Set a meeting with this Zlangco.

424
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:31,535
Talk about this.

425
00:26:35,306 --> 00:26:37,774
This is hopeless.

426
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:40,437
But l will talk...

427
00:26:40,478 --> 00:26:42,378
if he will.

428
00:26:56,928 --> 00:26:59,692
l'm not reading a single
M-Class planet in the system.

429
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,494
lf they went down
anywhere around here

430
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:02,861
they couldn't have survived.

431
00:27:02,994 --> 00:27:04,859
l'm not sure we can believe
the scans, Chief.

432
00:27:04,896 --> 00:27:07,558
The star is putting out abnormal
levels of delta radiation.

433
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,500
That would foul up
our long-range scanners.

434
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:13,766
We'll have to survey each planet
one at a time.

435
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:17,571
Not to mention...
two dozen or so moons

436
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:19,873
and an asteroid belt.

437
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:22,971
Bloody needle in a haystack.

438
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:26,781
A needle in a haystack.

439
00:27:26,818 --> 00:27:30,117
What we need is a magnet.

440
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:32,587
A magnet?

441
00:27:32,624 --> 00:27:34,455
Yeah. You want to pick
your piece of metal

442
00:27:34,492 --> 00:27:35,857
out of straw, you use a magnet.

443
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:38,294
l don't think
l'm following you, Chief.

444
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,322
Runabout hulls are made
of metallic composites

445
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:43,766
that interact
with magnetic fields.

446
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:46,828
We could send out a few probes
to scan the system

447
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:49,931
for those specific
magnetic resonance patterns.

448
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:52,409
lf Sisko's runabout
is in the system

449
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:55,902
we might pick up a fluctuation
in the hysteresis curve.

450
00:27:55,947 --> 00:27:57,141
The magnetic deflection

451
00:27:57,182 --> 00:27:58,706
of a runabout's hull
is extremely weak.

452
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,445
The probes will never be
able to detect it.

453
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:04,546
They will if l can outfit them
with a differential magnetomer.

454
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,250
A differential magnetomer?

455
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:07,622
Mm-hmm.

456
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:09,684
l've never heard
of a differential magnetomer.

457
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:11,059
How does it work?

458
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:15,726
l'll let you know
as soon as l finish making one.

459
00:28:32,684 --> 00:28:34,515
Nice work, Julian.

460
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,588
l'm surprised.

461
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:44,754
Zlangco has agreed
to listen to your proposals.

462
00:28:44,796 --> 00:28:45,763
Good. When?

463
00:28:45,797 --> 00:28:46,957
Right away.

464
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:49,330
We'll meet at a neutral site
near your vessel.

465
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:51,335
We've both agreed
to carry no firearms.

466
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:53,769
What if they use the opportunity
to set a trap?

467
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:56,330
We've taken the appropriate
precautions, Major

468
00:28:56,374 --> 00:28:58,467
but if you personally
would care

469
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,104
to check the security,
l'm sure your Commander

470
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:03,205
would allow you
to accompany us...

471
00:29:03,248 --> 00:29:06,115
Major Kira will be staying here
with the Kai.

472
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:09,744
What a shame.

473
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:19,321
You can't bury it, Kira.

474
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,324
What?

475
00:29:23,368 --> 00:29:26,030
Do you recognize yourself
in these people?

476
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:28,471
Me?

477
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:30,133
Oh, not...

478
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:31,802
not at all, l...

479
00:29:31,843 --> 00:29:34,243
They're content to die.

480
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:37,680
l've always fought
to stay alive.

481
00:29:39,651 --> 00:29:41,778
Oh...

482
00:29:45,323 --> 00:29:47,188
l don't want you to have

483
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:49,716
the wrong impression
of me, Opaka.

484
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:57,792
Just what impression
do you think l have?

485
00:29:59,637 --> 00:30:01,264
That, that...

486
00:30:01,306 --> 00:30:05,140
that l enjoy any of this.
l...

487
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:07,838
l don't enjoy fighting.

488
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:09,710
Yes, l've...

489
00:30:09,747 --> 00:30:12,648
l've fought my entire life,
but for a good cause.

490
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,777
For our freedom,
our independence.

491
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:17,811
And it was... it was brutal
and ugly, and...

492
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:25,460
but that's over for me now.

493
00:30:25,497 --> 00:30:28,523
That's... that's not who l am.

494
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:36,401
l-l don't want you to think
that l am this...

495
00:30:36,441 --> 00:30:41,504
violent person without a soul,
without a conscience.

496
00:30:41,546 --> 00:30:43,639
That is not who l am.

497
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:56,916
Oh!

498
00:30:58,396 --> 00:31:02,162
Don't deny the violence
inside of you, Kira.

499
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,261
Only when you accept it
can you move beyond it.

500
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,210
l've known nothing but violence
since l was a child.

501
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,485
ln the eyes of the Prophets

502
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,987
we're all children.

503
00:31:24,022 --> 00:31:27,890
Bajor has much to learn
from peace.

504
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:34,588
l'm afraid the Prophets
won't forgive me.

505
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:40,428
They're just waiting
for you to forgive yourself.

506
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:53,548
22 minutes into launch.

507
00:31:53,585 --> 00:31:55,746
All readings
within normal parameters.

508
00:31:55,787 --> 00:31:58,415
Probe ''B'' approaching
planet six.

509
00:31:58,456 --> 00:31:59,923
Three moons.

510
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:02,256
No change
in the hysteresis curve.

511
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:04,727
Probe ''C'' approaching
planet seven.

512
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:08,331
No change.

513
00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:11,494
What the hell would they
be doing here anyway?

514
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:12,662
lt's a waste of time.

515
00:32:12,704 --> 00:32:14,638
They could be
20 light-years from here

516
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:17,641
and we wouldn't have
the first clue.

517
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:20,610
Probe ''A'' approaching
planet three. One moon.

518
00:32:20,645 --> 00:32:23,113
Chief...

519
00:32:23,147 --> 00:32:26,605
Probe ''A'' measuring
a .0012 fluctuation

520
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:28,619
in the hysteresis curve.

521
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:29,915
lt's the third planet.

522
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:31,649
No, look, it isn't.

523
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:33,782
We're picking up something
from its moon.

524
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:37,261
Laying in a new course,
full impulse.

525
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:02,720
Any progress, Doctor?

526
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:03,948
Yes, sir.

527
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:05,579
l've got the computer
up... more or less.

528
00:33:05,623 --> 00:33:07,420
lt's processing the data now.

529
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:10,916
l can already confirm that
these microbes are artificial.

530
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:12,759
Rather like nanites, in a way.

531
00:33:12,797 --> 00:33:14,094
l should have
a complete analysis

532
00:33:14,132 --> 00:33:15,531
from the computer
in a few minutes.

533
00:33:15,566 --> 00:33:16,863
What's going on?

534
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,334
Talks about a cease-fire.

535
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:19,427
No kidding?

536
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,664
How did you arrange that?

537
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:23,674
l told them we'd transport them
off this moon.

538
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:25,938
lsn't that a bit like
assisting a jailbreak?

539
00:33:25,977 --> 00:33:27,376
l don't need you to interpret

540
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:29,107
the Prime Directive
for me, Doctor.

541
00:33:29,147 --> 00:33:30,580
Yes, sir, of course.
l only meant...

542
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:31,946
Whatever crimes
they've committed

543
00:33:31,983 --> 00:33:33,507
they've paid for
a hundred times over.

544
00:33:33,551 --> 00:33:35,109
They've been altered somehow

545
00:33:35,153 --> 00:33:36,984
and been abandoned
by their world.

546
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:39,512
l believe the Federation
would recognize them

547
00:33:39,557 --> 00:33:41,184
as separate and unique.

548
00:33:41,225 --> 00:33:43,750
Yes, sir.

549
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:47,424
Well, l should be checking
on that analysis.

550
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:52,002
So...

551
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,403
you are the leader
of the aliens.

552
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,876
Benjamin Sisko, Commander
of a Federation space station.

553
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,207
Federation?

554
00:34:00,244 --> 00:34:02,212
What does it matter to us,
Zlangco?

555
00:34:02,246 --> 00:34:04,043
lt matters to me.

556
00:34:04,082 --> 00:34:05,605
The Federation is made up

557
00:34:05,738 --> 00:34:07,763
of over a hundred planets
who have allied themselves

558
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:10,799
for mutual scientific, cultural
and defensive benefits.

559
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:14,142
The mission my people and l
are on is to explore the galaxy.

560
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,377
Such a noble purpose.

561
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:20,318
There'll be no reward
for our release, you know.

562
00:34:20,353 --> 00:34:22,218
You are being a fool, as usual.

563
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:24,780
A fool who always manages
to outwit you, Shel-la

564
00:34:24,824 --> 00:34:28,453
as l have proven,
over and over again.

565
00:34:28,494 --> 00:34:31,520
You care to die once again,
all you need to do is ask.

566
00:34:31,564 --> 00:34:33,828
lf you've had enough of this

567
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:37,267
then make your leaders
stop and listen.

568
00:34:37,303 --> 00:34:41,706
Your only reason to live is
to make each other suffer.

569
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:44,403
lf you've had enough
of suffering

570
00:34:44,444 --> 00:34:46,412
then make them stop.

571
00:34:46,446 --> 00:34:48,846
l'm not here to be a mediator

572
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:51,475
but if you ask
for an alternative

573
00:34:51,517 --> 00:34:53,144
l'll give you one.

574
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:55,120
We're listening.

575
00:34:55,154 --> 00:34:59,056
ln a matter of days,
when our rescue party arrives

576
00:34:59,092 --> 00:35:02,653
l can arrange
to transport you and your people

577
00:35:02,695 --> 00:35:06,392
off this moon,
if both sides can only cooperate

578
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:08,229
until then.

579
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:13,068
Zlangco, they will resettle us
on different planets.

580
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:14,903
lf that's what you wish.

581
00:35:14,974 --> 00:35:18,307
The two of you seem to have
discussed this plan in detail.

582
00:35:18,344 --> 00:35:19,675
Of course.

583
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:21,509
His crew has been with us
for two days.

584
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:25,449
Explain why you chose to ally
yourself with the Ennis.

585
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:27,316
We have allied ourselves
with no one.

586
00:35:27,353 --> 00:35:29,412
One of your people
fired a weapon at us.

587
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:32,891
We were defending ourselves.

588
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:35,291
l think you're lying.

589
00:35:35,328 --> 00:35:37,489
l don't know the alien

590
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,690
but l know Shel-la.

591
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:40,358
l know how his mind works.

592
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:44,460
l promise you,
this is an Ennis trick

593
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:46,768
to lure our entire
population out of hiding

594
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:48,171
so they can be slaughtered.

595
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:49,504
That's not true...!

596
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:53,938
Then the Ennis
are surely willing

597
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:56,310
to make the first
gesture of peace.

598
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:59,512
Let them bring all of their
people out of hiding first

599
00:35:59,552 --> 00:36:01,918
to prove their
honorable intentions.

600
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:09,750
Do you think
that l would allow

601
00:36:09,796 --> 00:36:14,597
a single Nol to escape
this planet alive?!

602
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:18,070
No more than l would
let an Ennis go free.

603
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:26,435
Ah!

604
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,437
l'm sorry, Commander

605
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,313
but l've discovered
we can't afford to die here--

606
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,840
not even once.

607
00:37:15,461 --> 00:37:19,056
lt's some kind
of artificial satellite system.

608
00:37:19,098 --> 00:37:20,793
That's what our probe
must have picked up.

609
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:21,891
Our sensors are reading

610
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:23,332
life-forms on the surface,
Chief.

611
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:24,666
l think some of them
are human.

612
00:37:24,704 --> 00:37:26,069
lf the ship's down there

613
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:28,835
why wouldn't the transponder
be sending out a...?

614
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:29,864
We're being scanned.

615
00:37:29,909 --> 00:37:31,877
lncreasing orbital altitude.

616
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:33,708
What are you thinking?

617
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:36,544
Well, the only thing that could
block out a transponder signal

618
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:38,049
is a broadband damping field.

619
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:40,882
That requires a low-level
satellite system, like this one.

620
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,650
Suddenly, we're being scanned
by those satellites, so...

621
00:37:43,689 --> 00:37:46,886
Maybe they had something to do
with our missing runabout.

622
00:37:46,926 --> 00:37:49,451
Exactly. See?

623
00:37:49,495 --> 00:37:52,123
They're putting out
a mutual induction field

624
00:37:52,164 --> 00:37:54,792
that would block out 99%
of all transmissions

625
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:56,392
to and from the surface.

626
00:37:56,435 --> 00:37:59,302
ls there any way for us to get
a com line through the field?

627
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:03,172
Well, l've got one percent
to work with, don't l?

628
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:26,995
The analysis is very clear.

629
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:29,593
Once the microbes
have restored a body after death

630
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:32,126
that body then becomes
permanently dependent on them

631
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:33,536
for all cellular functions.

632
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:34,596
Permanently?

633
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,902
lt gets worse.

634
00:38:35,942 --> 00:38:38,001
The designers made them
environment specific.

635
00:38:38,044 --> 00:38:41,343
lf the microbes are removed
from this ecosystem

636
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,041
they'll stop functioning.

637
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:45,573
So, if we transport
anyone off this planet

638
00:38:45,618 --> 00:38:47,552
we kill them.

639
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:49,781
l'm afraid so.

640
00:38:49,822 --> 00:38:51,687
The Kai?

641
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,125
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Sisko.

642
00:38:57,163 --> 00:38:58,130
Do you read me?

643
00:38:58,164 --> 00:38:59,654
This is O'Brien.
Come in.

644
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:01,326
Go ahead, Chief.
l can barely read you.

645
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,335
ls everyone all right?

646
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:06,827
We're alive, but the <i>Yangtzee</i>
<i>Kiang</i> was destroyed.

647
00:39:06,872 --> 00:39:08,339
Will you be able to beam us up?

648
00:39:08,374 --> 00:39:10,239
Not quite yet, Commander.

649
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:11,868
We've got to find
a way to penetrate

650
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:13,206
this network of satellites.

651
00:39:13,245 --> 00:39:14,473
They're making it impossible
for us

652
00:39:14,513 --> 00:39:15,741
to lock on to anything
down there.

653
00:39:15,781 --> 00:39:16,873
Understood.

654
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:18,974
But those satellites
will come after you

655
00:39:19,018 --> 00:39:20,383
if you get too close.

656
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:21,852
They're armed.

657
00:39:21,887 --> 00:39:24,014
One of them cut us down
without any trouble at all.

658
00:39:24,056 --> 00:39:25,489
Yeah, we figured as much.

659
00:39:25,524 --> 00:39:27,890
Let me know before you're
ready to make an attempt.

660
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:29,918
Acknowledged. <i>Rio Grande</i> out.

661
00:39:32,732 --> 00:39:35,064
We have to talk to the Kai.

662
00:39:42,408 --> 00:39:44,035
ls there a cease-fire?

663
00:39:44,076 --> 00:39:46,203
Neither side took it seriously.

664
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:48,179
l'm not at all surprised.

665
00:39:48,214 --> 00:39:50,045
You were right, Kira.

666
00:39:50,082 --> 00:39:53,540
They don't know how to do
anything else but die.

667
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:55,713
They've forgotten how to live.

668
00:39:55,755 --> 00:39:58,246
The <i>Rio Grande</i> has made contact.

669
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,053
Dax and O'Brien are in orbit.

670
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:04,358
They're working on a way
to penetrate the defense system.

671
00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:07,366
l'll be staying, Commander.

672
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,027
What?

673
00:40:09,068 --> 00:40:11,628
This is the answer
to all the prophecies

674
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,898
of my life.

675
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:14,235
lt's the wrong answer, Opaka.

676
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:15,570
You can't stay here.

677
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:17,906
l didn't know how or why,
but when we came

678
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:21,879
through the wormhole,
l knew l wouldn't be returning.

679
00:40:21,914 --> 00:40:24,212
You must tell our people, Kira

680
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,742
that l have answered the call
of the Prophets.

681
00:40:27,787 --> 00:40:30,654
l was brought here
because it is time

682
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:34,386
for these people
to begin their healing process

683
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:36,759
just as you were brought here

684
00:40:36,796 --> 00:40:39,959
to begin yours.

685
00:40:40,132 --> 00:40:42,225
You know, all we really
need to do is find a way

686
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:44,600
to create a gap in the net.

687
00:40:44,637 --> 00:40:47,765
Maybe a photon would destroy
one of the satellites.

688
00:40:47,807 --> 00:40:50,367
Maybe, but you think they'd
build a defense network

689
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:51,774
with that in mind.

690
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:54,712
You shoot one,
the rest might swarm up

691
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:57,079
like Vayan horn flies.

692
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:03,043
We need to go
for something simpler.

693
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:06,058
All l need is
about a 15% increase

694
00:41:06,092 --> 00:41:08,424
in the opening in the net.

695
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,567
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Sisko.

696
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:17,068
Go ahead, Chief.

697
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:19,480
We're going to try
to poke a hole up here, sir.

698
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:22,013
if you're about ready
to end your stay.

699
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:24,176
Only three of us
are coming back.

700
00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:25,879
Kai Opaka is remaining.

701
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:27,886
Benjamin, please confirm.

702
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:30,856
Did you say we're not
transporting the Kai?

703
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:33,519
That's correct.
l'll explain later.

704
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:35,222
We need a few minutes,
Commander.

705
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:36,593
<i>Rio Grande</i> out.

706
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:41,095
Leaving without us?

707
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:45,371
My analysis of these microbes
that keep you alive

708
00:41:45,406 --> 00:41:47,533
showed that if you were
to leave this moon

709
00:41:47,575 --> 00:41:48,735
you would die.

710
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:51,904
Then there is no end.

711
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,914
Commander...

712
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:57,348
l find myself caught
in a moral dilemma.

713
00:41:57,384 --> 00:42:01,480
As much as l am dedicated
to the preservation of life

714
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:03,422
l wonder if we shouldn't
help these people

715
00:42:03,457 --> 00:42:04,856
put an end to this torture.

716
00:42:04,892 --> 00:42:06,189
How could you do that?

717
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:07,818
Anything that can be programmed

718
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:08,953
can be reprogrammed.

719
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:10,122
lf l could disable

720
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:12,132
the mechanism
in these microbes

721
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:14,657
they should no longer function
when someone is killed

722
00:42:14,702 --> 00:42:16,863
and these people would
finally be able to die.

723
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,508
You've seen our life here.

724
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:25,512
Please, it's
the only solution left.

725
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:28,515
You give us a way
to reprogram these microbes

726
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:31,017
and we'll put an end
to this war.

727
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:34,350
You really think the fear of
death will end the fighting?

728
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,413
Never has in any other war.

729
00:42:36,457 --> 00:42:39,688
No.

730
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:42,195
But it will allow us
to finally win

731
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:44,595
to wipe out the Nol for good.

732
00:42:44,632 --> 00:42:47,465
On this world, Doctor

733
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:50,902
your disabled microbes
would be the ultimate weapon.

734
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:55,271
We could finally
and truly destroy our enemies!

735
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:57,334
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Sisko.

736
00:42:57,378 --> 00:42:59,369
Stand by for transport.

737
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:05,318
Ready.

738
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:07,650
Coordinates set.

739
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:09,485
Launching probe.

740
00:43:09,523 --> 00:43:11,957
12 seconds to intercept.

741
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:14,517
Go on, go on, go for it.

742
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:17,121
One of the satellites
is breaking orbit

743
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:18,631
moving toward the probe.

744
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:20,395
That's it.

745
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:24,200
The satellite is showing
a power buildup--

746
00:43:24,238 --> 00:43:26,263
about 800 megawatts.

747
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:30,106
Probe destroyed.

748
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:31,736
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Sisko.

749
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,872
Trying to lock on, Commander.

750
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:35,404
Establishing pattern lock.

751
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:37,849
You can't leave
without giving us...

752
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:40,149
Energize when ready, Chief.

753
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:54,998
Opaka, if we can
ever find a way...

754
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:58,493
My work is here now, Commander.

755
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:07,973
But your power and mine...

756
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:10,779
will cross again.

757
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:20,458
Energizing.
