1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,292
l thought l told you
to cancel that order.

2
00:00:12,337 --> 00:00:16,330
Now, what am l supposed to do
with 5,000 wrappages

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,707
of Cardassian <i>yamok</i> sauce?

4
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:21,508
They're the only ones
who could stomach that swill.

5
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:23,343
Hey, Nog, are you going
to play or what?

6
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:25,441
You ordered it,
you're going to pay for it.

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,918
l'm going to take
half your paycheck every week

8
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:30,319
for the next six years!

9
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:35,918
From now on, no more
Cardassian food in here

10
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:37,588
ever!

11
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:39,927
Come on, Nog, it's your turn.

12
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:42,195
5,000 wrappages.

13
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:45,465
That's a lot of <i>yamok</i> sauce.

14
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,495
Look, either
take your turn, or l win.

15
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,030
lt'd be a shame
to let it go to waste.

16
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:52,976
That's it-- game over.

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,639
Jake, l'm getting
that tingling in the lobes

18
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,650
and when a lobe tingles,
it means only one thing--

19
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,117
opportunity.

20
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:02,882
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:05,321
l'm talking about
gold-pressed latinum--

22
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,154
maybe four or five bars.

23
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:10,092
l thought you were
talking about <i>yamok</i> sauce.

24
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:13,154
You've got a lot to learn
about opportunity.

25
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:14,528
Come on.

26
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:15,863
Where?

27
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:21,263
Station Log, Stardate 46844.3.

28
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:22,864
With the help of the Federation

29
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:25,035
Bajor is about to commence

30
00:01:25,077 --> 00:01:27,671
its first large-scale
energy transfer--

31
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:31,979
the tapping of the molten core
of its fifth moon, Jeraddo.

32
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:34,884
Magma pressure's
remained constant.

33
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,658
Differential subsurface
movement is at 0.3 percent.

34
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,159
ls that good?

35
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:44,162
They'd tell you if it weren't.

36
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:46,187
Oh, uh, why is that
red light blinking?

37
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,825
We're in normal standby mode.

38
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:51,802
Oh, l take it, then, we're not
expecting any surprises.

39
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:55,466
We don't like surprises
any more than you do.

40
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:57,168
Minister Toran, these
people are professionals.

41
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,370
Forgive my bureaucratic
nit-picking, Major

42
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,276
but we're counting
on Jeraddo's energy

43
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:04,146
to heat a few hundred thousand
Bajoran homes this winter.

44
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,910
And, with that in mind

45
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:08,511
we're due to make
our next inspection.

46
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:18,321
Anyway, so there l was,
sitting in Quark's

47
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:22,629
when Morn just comes over to me
and invites me for dinner.

48
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:26,159
Grid square 12-delta
reads clear of life-forms.

49
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:28,502
Morn?
Are you serious?

50
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,338
Beginning scan
of grid square 15-delta.

51
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:33,344
So, what did you say?

52
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:35,005
l said l was busy.

53
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:36,673
Good.

54
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:40,674
But you know those seven
or eight little wiry hairs

55
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,483
that come out of his forehead?

56
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,387
What?

57
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:48,018
Well, they make him
look kind of cute.

58
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:49,686
That's odd.

59
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,526
Sensors read a humanoid presence
in 15-delta.

60
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:55,362
Could be one
of the project thermologists.

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,027
Not in 15-delta.

62
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:58,899
Look for yourself.

63
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:00,564
All the inhabitants

64
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:03,472
were supposed to be
evacuated by now.

65
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:08,002
Well, l better beam down there,
take a look around.

66
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:11,975
Ready to transport.

67
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,882
l won't be long.

68
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:46,641
The problem is,
they don't like uniforms.

69
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:50,644
Neither do l,
but it comes with the job.

70
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:53,089
Which is?

71
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:55,649
Do we talk, or do they attack?

72
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:06,734
You're halfway pretty.

73
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,170
Does that mean l can come in?

74
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:10,401
No. No, l don't like
uniforms either.

75
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:11,909
l'm scared of them.

76
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:14,377
See, we had our fill
of uniformed bullies.

77
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:15,936
l'm no Cardassian.

78
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:19,348
You know you were supposed
to be out of here by now.

79
00:06:19,384 --> 00:06:22,012
All l know is this farm, girl.

80
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:25,420
Now, you want proof,
just look at my crop.

81
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:28,153
Uh, l'd rather you
didn't call me ''girl.''

82
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:30,058
lt's mostly katterpod beans

83
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:32,222
but you won't find
better katterpods.

84
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:35,062
My father always said
you get bigger katterpods

85
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,398
when you spray in
some chlorobicrobes.

86
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:38,424
ls that right?

87
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,596
Well, that could be.

88
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:41,367
Your family's farmers then?

89
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:44,273
No, but if l don't get
on your good side soon

90
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:46,277
my arm's going to fall off.

91
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,836
Yeah, pretty eyes like yours
deserve a meal.

92
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,347
You come on in.

93
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:52,350
l'm afraid we don't have time.

94
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:54,352
Look, obviously,
you were overlooked

95
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:55,910
in the general evacuation.

96
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:57,216
l got to get you out of here.

97
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:58,779
We'll talk about that
over supper.

98
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:00,518
Come on.

99
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,728
There he is.

100
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:18,240
220, bottom price. 220.

101
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,546
Excuse me, sir.

102
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,048
Are you the Captain
of the Lissepian cargo ship?

103
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,380
That's right.

104
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:28,386
And you do a lot of trading
with the Cardassians.

105
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,479
Why not?
One thing about Cardassians--

106
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:31,716
they pay their bills.

107
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:33,280
Yes, l've heard that.

108
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:35,919
l have also heard
they love their <i>yamok</i> sauce.

109
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,759
Look, if you're trying to buy
some <i>yamok</i> sauce from me, boy

110
00:07:38,797 --> 00:07:39,764
you're wasting your time.

111
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:40,765
l'm not carrying any.

112
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,063
We're not buying,
we're selling.

113
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:44,795
5,000 wrappages of it.

114
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:46,303
Original, not replicated.

115
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:49,000
Where would you two boys
get all that <i>yamok</i> sauce?

116
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,507
We have connections.

117
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,169
5,000, you say?

118
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,235
And they could be yours for, say

119
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,770
five bars of
gold-pressed latinum.

120
00:07:56,815 --> 00:07:58,783
That's a lot of latinum.

121
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:00,944
That's a lot of <i>yamok</i> sauce.

122
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:03,420
Look, l'm not carrying
any latinum

123
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:05,923
but l'll tell you what l'll do--

124
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:08,323
l'll trade you something for it.

125
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,385
We were counting on latinum.

126
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:11,895
Hold on.

127
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,557
What would you trade?

128
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,761
l'll give you 100 gross
of self-sealing stem bolts.

129
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:19,736
Some Bajoran ordered them
from me, and now he can't pay.

130
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:23,036
Self-sealing stem bolts?

131
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:24,405
Top-grade merchandise.

132
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:27,411
You won't find a better
stem bolt in this sector.

133
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,310
l don't think so.

134
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:31,975
We deal strictly in latinum.

135
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:36,146
Nog, are you sure?

136
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:38,485
What are we going
to do with stem bolts?

137
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:41,014
What are we going
to do with <i>yamok</i> sauce?

138
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:49,527
Sir, l have discussed
it with my partner

139
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,467
and you have a deal.

140
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:53,061
Good.

141
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:56,470
l'll meet you at Cargo Bay 9
at 2100 hours.

142
00:08:56,508 --> 00:08:58,499
We'll make the trade then.

143
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:02,971
Now, the question is,
what are we going to do

144
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:06,211
with a hundred gross
of self-sealing stem bolts?

145
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:08,276
l have a better question.

146
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:11,220
How do we get
your uncle's <i>yamok</i> sauce?

147
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,027
At least you're not the type

148
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:26,697
that's going to dispossess
a man on an empty stomach.

149
00:09:26,738 --> 00:09:28,171
Wouldn't think of it.

150
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:29,867
Well, that's good,
'cause these roots

151
00:09:29,908 --> 00:09:31,739
are going to take
three hours to soften.

152
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:33,437
What?

153
00:09:33,478 --> 00:09:36,914
You wouldn't want to eat your
roots hard, now, would you?

154
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,609
l'm in no hurry.

155
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:41,151
Kira to <i>Ganges.</i>

156
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:42,653
This is Dax.

157
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:44,245
Are you all right?

158
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:46,416
A man with a talent for delay

159
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,052
has just invited me
to a farewell supper here.

160
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,594
You go on.

161
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:53,062
l'll have one of
the thermologists bring me back.

162
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:54,895
Enjoy supper.
Dax out.

163
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,730
Here you go.

164
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:58,065
You wash it off first

165
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:00,229
and then you scrape
the skin off.

166
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:19,680
You don't talk much.

167
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:21,692
Oh, they don't talk at all.

168
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:24,354
The Cardassians
took care of that.

169
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:28,092
They escaped up
to this moon 18 years ago.

170
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:29,791
l've been here 40.

171
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,734
We did real well together.

172
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:33,498
Oh, get out the plates

173
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:36,268
and utensils like a good girl,
would you?

174
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:38,400
That cupboard right over there.

175
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:53,413
You know, you look real good

176
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,449
even from this angle.

177
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:58,792
But you know something?

178
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,697
You walk
like a carnivorous rastipod.

179
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,257
Now, look...

180
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,303
You're trying to make me mad.

181
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:13,076
How am l doing?

182
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:15,671
Not well enough
to get rid of me.

183
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:17,044
Damn!

184
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:21,181
Well,
what do they call you, dear?

185
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:22,686
l'm Major Kira.

186
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,381
l'm in charge of evacuating...

187
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:26,413
Your given name.

188
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,289
Nerys.

189
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:32,524
Nerys.

190
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:34,828
Well, Nerys, l'm Mullibok.

191
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:37,198
And these roots are really going
to take three hours to cook

192
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:38,702
so you might as well
just sit down

193
00:11:38,736 --> 00:11:39,896
and relax yourself, child.

194
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:41,963
lt's going to be tasty.

195
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,605
Mullibok...

196
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,675
they begin tapping the core
of this moon in seven days.

197
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,778
l know.

198
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:59,051
You are only three people.

199
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,456
This project is going
to benefit thousands...

200
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:02,720
hundreds of thousands.

201
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,321
l made myself unconcerned
with that 40 years ago

202
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:10,061
when l escaped
from a Cardassian labor camp

203
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:11,863
on your precious Bajor.

204
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,929
What we're trying to create now

205
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:18,306
is what you weren't allowed
to have then.

206
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:20,709
lt can be your Bajor, too.

207
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:22,303
This is where l live.

208
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:23,575
This is my home.

209
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:26,209
You can have a home on Bajor

210
00:12:26,251 --> 00:12:29,379
with people to welcome you
and your friends.

211
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,981
Life will be different, yes,
but it will be fine

212
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:34,924
really.

213
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,018
No, it won't.

214
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:39,791
l told you, my life's here.

215
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:42,231
lf l leave here, l'll die.

216
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,633
So l'd rather die here.

217
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,527
Dabo!

218
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,327
Uncle Quark!

219
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:11,165
You.

220
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:14,969
Last night, that dabo player
who dropped his drink?

221
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:17,134
l saw you run
and get him another one

222
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:18,404
without charging him.

223
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:21,745
l warned you

224
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:24,147
about picking up
your father's habits.

225
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,048
lt'll never happen again, Uncle.

226
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:38,492
You know, l was trying
to find some storage space

227
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:41,364
for the shipment of <i>lokar</i> beans
that are due in tomorrow.

228
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,029
ls it okay if l stack them
on top of the <i>yamok</i> sauce--

229
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,765
if l can reach that high?

230
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:48,671
Please don't talk to me
about <i>yamok</i> sauce.

231
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:50,675
Do you want me to get rid of it?

232
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,678
l could take it
to the matter reclamation unit.

233
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:56,579
Anything.
Just get it out of my sight.

234
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:01,182
Nog... you're a good boy.

235
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:16,234
l stowed away aboard
a Cardassian survey vessel

236
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:19,328
which was making stops
all through the Bajoran system.

237
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:22,101
They were looking
for possible mining sites.

238
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:24,439
Anyway, when we got here
to Jeraddo

239
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:26,104
l overpowered the crew

240
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:29,603
and l stole whatever l'd need
to start building a life here.

241
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:31,206
You overpowered the crew?

242
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,376
Yourself?

243
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:34,750
There was only six of them.

244
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:36,220
That was fortunate for me

245
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:39,713
because l was somewhat weakened
by the captivity and starvation.

246
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:41,385
Anyway, here l was

247
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:44,624
the first person ever
to settle on this moon

248
00:14:44,663 --> 00:14:45,721
and the only trouble was

249
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:47,925
that l didn't have
any kind of farm implements.

250
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,958
So, once again, starvation and l

251
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:52,300
were staring each other
in the face.

252
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,306
Uh... l'm not boring you?

253
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,466
No, no.

254
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,442
l want to hear who won.

255
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:58,602
Ah.

256
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,612
Well, it was mind over matter.

257
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:01,977
Every 26 hours

258
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:04,709
l'd just tighten up
my waist belt another notch

259
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,183
and, that way,
my belly didn't know

260
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:07,185
that it was shrinking.

261
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:08,379
Excuse me?

262
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,752
You asked me to tell you
how l got started here

263
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:12,757
which l'm very
politely trying to do.

264
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,258
Now, will you
kindly let me finish?

265
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:15,590
l assume you found some food

266
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,255
before you ran out
of belt notches.

267
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:18,695
Are you telling the story
or am l?

268
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:21,464
By all means.

269
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,900
l can't wait
to hear how it ends.

270
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:26,234
Obviously, l was going

271
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:30,003
to have to plant
and harvest a crop.

272
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:33,011
So l did what
any person would do

273
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:35,843
who had to build
an entire world for himself.

274
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:39,373
First, l rolled back
and forth on the ground

275
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:41,181
till it surrendered.

276
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,983
Then l got down
on my hands and knees

277
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:44,011
and l started to plow

278
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:46,149
using nothing but
my fingernails, mind you.

279
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:49,285
l plowed every furrow
in that field

280
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:50,386
straight as a plumb line.

281
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:51,691
Now, that is inventive.

282
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,960
Yeah. lf l came across a deposit
of mineralized clay

283
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:56,627
what l'd do is just
grind it up in my teeth.

284
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:59,160
That way, it enriched the soil.

285
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:04,938
Baltrim, how about some
of that wonderful wine here?

286
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:07,741
What l'm telling you, Major...

287
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,839
l tamed this place.

288
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:10,974
Me.

289
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,540
l believe you.

290
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:17,150
You look like a bit
of a fighter yourself.

291
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:20,420
Well, on Bajor, we had to be.

292
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,917
To get rid of the Cardassians,
huh?

293
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:25,988
Mindless butchers.

294
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:27,931
We paid them back.

295
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,594
l bet you did.

296
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:32,399
They probably didn't
know what hit them.

297
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,429
l'm sorry l missed the fun.

298
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:36,998
Fun?

299
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:40,772
Must have been like spearing
kandippers in a bottle.

300
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:42,110
Wait a minute.
Are you serious?

301
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:44,274
You know what
the Cardassians were like--

302
00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:45,647
what weapons they had.

303
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:47,811
We didn't stand a chance
against them.

304
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:49,320
How did you beat them then?

305
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:51,983
Well, we beat them because...

306
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:58,828
because we hung on
like fanatics.

307
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,900
Hung on like fanatics.

308
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,671
l got to remember that.

309
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:22,320
Mullibok, listen to me.

310
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:23,821
One of these days

311
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:26,825
l'm going to have
to finish up that kiln.

312
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,225
Then l can temper my baking pots

313
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:31,559
put some colorful
lids on them.

314
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:33,861
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

315
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:35,799
l appreciate your trying
to hang on here.

316
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:37,631
l sympathize,
but you can't stay here.

317
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,003
The minute they start
tapping the crust

318
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:43,098
it will release carbon
and sulfur compounds.

319
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:44,700
lt will make
the air unbreathable.

320
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:46,506
The Cardassians
probably told you

321
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:48,513
you didn't stand
a chance either.

322
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:49,844
Did you surrender?

323
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,474
No.

324
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:54,953
Why do expect me to act
any different than you?

325
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:56,614
Now, you tell them

326
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:59,317
they can start
cracking this moon apart

327
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:00,950
whenever they're ready.

328
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,893
l'll be here.

329
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:08,330
l'll tell them.

330
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:28,480
So that's a stem bolt.

331
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,454
A self-sealing stem bolt.

332
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:32,150
There's a difference.

333
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:34,421
You're sure about that?

334
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,226
What's important is that
it's top-grade merchandise.

335
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:41,755
You can't get a better
stem bolt in this sector.

336
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,496
And we have
a hundred gross of them.

337
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:46,663
That's a lot of stem bolts.

338
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,400
Excuse me, gentlemen.

339
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,136
Anyone know what
this cargo's doing here?

340
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:53,974
lt belongs
to my Uncle Quark.

341
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:55,445
They're stem bolts.

342
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:57,779
Will you do me a favor,
and tell your uncle

343
00:18:57,816 --> 00:18:59,943
we're getting a little weary

344
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,215
of him bypassing
import procedures.

345
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:04,245
l'll certainly do that, sir.

346
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:08,316
lt's just that my Uncle Quark
really needed some stem bolts.

347
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,090
You mean
self-sealing stem bolts.

348
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,791
That's right!
That's it!

349
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:14,628
Self-sealing stem bolts.

350
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,964
Well, he sure needs
a lot of them.

351
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:18,969
lt's top-grade merchandise.

352
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:21,335
You can't find a better
stem bolt in this sector.

353
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:22,772
Oh, l don't doubt it.

354
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:24,833
What does he need them for?

355
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:27,210
Uh, the usual.

356
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:28,605
The usual?

357
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,112
Well, you know.

358
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:33,115
Why does anybody use
self-sealing stem bolts?

359
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:34,776
l wouldn't know.

360
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:36,682
l've never used them.

361
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,186
Never?

362
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:40,189
l've never even seen one.

363
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:42,987
Then how do you know
they're self-sealing?

364
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:46,995
l read it here
on the manifest padd.

365
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:52,160
l would have bet anything

366
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:54,135
that he would have
known what they were.

367
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,832
l told you, we should have
asked that freighter captain.

368
00:19:56,873 --> 00:19:58,465
Wait.

369
00:19:58,508 --> 00:20:01,306
l know who could tell us what
self-sealing stem bolts are--

370
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:04,507
the Bajoran who ordered
them in the first place.

371
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:07,710
His name's got to be
on the shipping codes.

372
00:20:14,524 --> 00:20:15,991
Sirco Ch'Ano.

373
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:18,016
lt has his address
and everything.

374
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:20,756
You think he'll be mad
that we have his stem bolts?

375
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:25,332
He couldn't afford them.
Remember?

376
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:29,737
But we'll offer to sell them
to him at a discount.

377
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:44,044
l'm glad you finally
made it back.

378
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:46,351
l was getting worried about you.

379
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:48,016
ls he alone?

380
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:51,390
l think Minister Toran
is in there with him.

381
00:20:51,427 --> 00:20:53,258
Even better.

382
00:20:54,897 --> 00:20:56,364
l don't understand.

383
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,799
There were 47 other people
living on that moon.

384
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,302
They all left willingly.

385
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:01,735
How do we know?

386
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:04,501
All we know is that they
obeyed the order to leave.

387
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,167
And so will these people.

388
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:08,006
You haven't met Mullibok.

389
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:10,137
ls there anything
you can offer that might

390
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:11,942
make him more willing to leave?

391
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:13,448
Not a thing, believe me.

392
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:14,814
Would a postponement help?

393
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:17,012
Give us time to work
something out with him.

394
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:18,350
We can't postpone.

395
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:21,152
And, if he stays,
he'll be committing suicide.

396
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,590
We'll have to beam
him off the surface.

397
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:27,187
lf we take him like that,
we'll be killing him.

398
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,357
l refuse to allow
three stubborn holdouts

399
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:31,162
to jeopardize a project

400
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,294
that will benefit
so many of our people.

401
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:35,804
l am sorry, Major.

402
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:37,362
lf there was anything else
that we could do

403
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:38,396
we'd have done it.

404
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:40,033
But there is another way.

405
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:43,203
We can tap the core using
phased energy retrieval.

406
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:44,304
l thought we'd agreed

407
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:46,315
phased energy retrieval
would take too long.

408
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:48,044
lt would mean
waiting a full year

409
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:50,951
before we can extract any
meaningful amount of energy.

410
00:21:50,987 --> 00:21:53,217
l wish we had the time
to be more delicate

411
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:54,223
but we don't.

412
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:56,054
So, instead, we'll act
like Cardassians.

413
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:57,457
Easy, Major.

414
00:21:57,493 --> 00:21:58,790
l resent that.

415
00:21:58,828 --> 00:21:59,852
lt's obvious to me

416
00:21:59,896 --> 00:22:02,490
that you've developed
a feeling for this man.

417
00:22:02,532 --> 00:22:03,999
Fine, l can accept that.

418
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:07,968
But if you're not comfortable
with completing this assignment

419
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:09,972
l'll find someone else who is.

420
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:14,707
That won't be necessary.

421
00:22:21,584 --> 00:22:23,142
Mullibok?

422
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:24,653
Mullibok?

423
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:26,484
What about the other two?

424
00:22:26,522 --> 00:22:29,355
They, uh, have a cottage
35, 40 meters through there.

425
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:32,657
Now, remember, these people
were victims of the Cardassians.

426
00:22:32,695 --> 00:22:34,322
They don't speak.

427
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:37,332
They're very frightened
of uniforms. Understood?

428
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:38,833
Understood, Major.

429
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:41,302
lf, uh, you find them
working in the fields

430
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:44,636
just gather up their clothes
and supplies, l guess.

431
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:46,141
Without permission?

432
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:48,871
We're not going to get
their permission.

433
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:51,436
Just be very careful
with everything.

434
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:05,117
You plan to use that?

435
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:08,520
Protocol.

436
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:12,091
lf you like, l'll help
you pack your things.

437
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:15,262
You sent those two uniforms
after Baltrim and Keena.

438
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:18,137
That's right.
l'm doing what has to be done.

439
00:23:18,174 --> 00:23:19,505
Me, too.

440
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,008
Don't make us take you by force.

441
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:32,384
Please.

442
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:38,358
l promise you,
it won't be so bad.

443
00:23:38,394 --> 00:23:41,557
You can plant whatever
you want to on Bajor.

444
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:44,725
Stay by yourself
if you want to-- that's fine.

445
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:46,564
Take some seeds with you

446
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:49,730
for those terrible roots
of yours l had to eat.

447
00:23:49,772 --> 00:23:51,535
Just listen to reason.

448
00:23:51,574 --> 00:23:53,667
Listen to yourself, Major.

449
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:55,700
Tell me what you hear.

450
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:57,212
What do you mean?

451
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,304
Well, l mean, you sound

452
00:23:58,347 --> 00:24:00,042
like a two-headed
Malgorian l knew

453
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:01,640
when l was a boy.

454
00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:04,312
You ever try to talk
to a two-headed Malgorian?

455
00:24:04,353 --> 00:24:06,514
This is no time
for one of your stories.

456
00:24:06,556 --> 00:24:08,421
See, the thing with
two-headed Malgorians is

457
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:10,925
that it can never figure out
what it really wants to do

458
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,894
and that can be very
confusing, believe me.

459
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:14,863
You know, eventually,
you're going

460
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:17,422
to have to stop talking
and deal with this.

461
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:19,798
And the trouble
with my Malgorian friend

462
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,996
was he had all kinds of problems

463
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:24,563
and he couldn't decide
how to solve them.

464
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:26,802
So he'd always
come running to me

465
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:29,140
so l could solve them for him.

466
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,645
Mullibok...

467
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,547
You know what l finally
said to that Malgorian?

468
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:38,145
l said, ''Fellas, deal
with it yourselves.'' Hmm?

469
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,757
Fine.

470
00:24:45,795 --> 00:24:47,695
l'll pack your things myself.

471
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,958
Major!

472
00:24:48,998 --> 00:24:49,987
They're crazy!

473
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:52,364
This man just stuck me
with a farm implement.

474
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:54,232
And she attacked me from behind.

475
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,237
Let her go!

476
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:56,238
Stay back!

477
00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:57,432
Let her go!

478
00:25:02,812 --> 00:25:04,074
No!

479
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,319
You!

480
00:25:12,355 --> 00:25:14,323
Beam up to the runabout
and call the station.

481
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:15,984
Get Dr. Bashir.

482
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:17,515
Move!

483
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,367
l still can't see you.

484
00:25:29,405 --> 00:25:31,532
What did you say your name was?

485
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:34,236
l'm getting some kind
of subspace interference.

486
00:25:34,276 --> 00:25:35,903
My name's...

487
00:25:35,945 --> 00:25:38,505
We're the, um, the Nog and...

488
00:25:38,547 --> 00:25:40,344
the Noh-Jay Consortium

489
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:43,750
and we have 100 gross
of self-sealing stem bolts.

490
00:25:43,786 --> 00:25:45,151
And we were wondering...

491
00:25:45,187 --> 00:25:46,518
You have my stem bolts?

492
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:48,250
What would you want for them?

493
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,657
We'll let you have them for...

494
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:54,822
five bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

495
00:25:54,864 --> 00:25:56,161
Five bars?!

496
00:25:56,198 --> 00:25:57,324
Four bars.

497
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:58,731
l don't think l...

498
00:25:58,768 --> 00:26:00,497
Three bars.

499
00:26:00,536 --> 00:26:03,562
lf l had any latinum,
l'd already have the bolts.

500
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:05,904
Would you consider an exchange?

501
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,239
l would consider
one bar of latinum.

502
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:10,245
He doesn't have any latinum.

503
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,076
Let's exchange for something.

504
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:13,581
l don't want ''something.''

505
00:26:13,616 --> 00:26:14,981
l want latinum.

506
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:16,381
l can't hear you.

507
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:19,388
Can l interest you
in a piece of land?

508
00:26:19,422 --> 00:26:20,548
Land is good.

509
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:21,613
For what?

510
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:23,090
lt's nothing but dirt.

511
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,592
How much land?

512
00:26:24,627 --> 00:26:27,425
l can let you have
seven tessipates.

513
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:28,930
Seven sounds good.

514
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:31,432
First <i>yamok</i> sauce,
then stem bolts

515
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:34,994
now tessipates--
and still no profit.

516
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:36,662
We're getting closer.

517
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:38,173
l can feel it.

518
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:39,674
You can?

519
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:41,176
l think so.

520
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,677
Do we have a deal?

521
00:26:42,712 --> 00:26:45,510
We'd have to see proof
that you own the land.

522
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:46,795
Naturally.

523
00:26:46,928 --> 00:26:49,897
You'll get the transmission
on that by 1200 hours.

524
00:26:49,931 --> 00:26:53,560
You just bought yourself
some stem bolts.

525
00:26:53,602 --> 00:26:55,502
Land.

526
00:26:55,537 --> 00:26:57,402
Dirt.

527
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,010
Just rest easy.

528
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:07,742
You took a phaser blast
which punctured your peritoneum.

529
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:09,272
lt's serious.

530
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:13,310
And if you try to move around,
you'll make it worse.

531
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:15,482
Another uniform.

532
00:27:15,523 --> 00:27:17,923
Dr. Julian Bashir, Starfleet.

533
00:27:18,026 --> 00:27:19,618
Major Kira sent for me.

534
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:20,889
She did, huh?

535
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:22,624
You're backwards, Nerys.

536
00:27:22,664 --> 00:27:23,824
l told you.

537
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:32,740
With me unconscious

538
00:27:32,774 --> 00:27:35,208
she could have swept us all
off of here

539
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:37,211
with no trouble at all.

540
00:27:37,245 --> 00:27:40,112
My friends Baltrim and Keena?

541
00:27:40,148 --> 00:27:42,116
They've been evacuated to Bajor.

542
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,847
l'll be taking you back
to our station, so l can...

543
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:46,945
No.

544
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:49,319
l stay here.

545
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,101
He refuses to leave.

546
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:02,899
Really?

547
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:05,405
Well, he's got to be cared for.

548
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,409
l'm going to take him
without his permission.

549
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:10,070
No, you're not.

550
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:12,602
Well, he needs close attention.

551
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:14,114
l'll be here.

552
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:16,276
There's no medical facility
here.

553
00:28:16,318 --> 00:28:17,842
Leave the instructions

554
00:28:17,886 --> 00:28:20,878
and whatever medication
you think he'll need.

555
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:33,933
She didn't offer a word
of explanation, sir.

556
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:36,061
She simply removed
her uniform tunic

557
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:37,571
and started building.

558
00:28:37,605 --> 00:28:38,936
Well, Doctor

559
00:28:39,007 --> 00:28:41,635
right now she stands
a pretty good chance

560
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:43,871
of being out of uniform
permanently.

561
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:46,073
l'm going
to tell Minister Toran

562
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:48,605
that she's remained
temporarily on Jeraddo

563
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,447
at your request.

564
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:53,010
But, sir, that isn't true.

565
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,284
Make it true, Doctor.

566
00:28:58,326 --> 00:29:00,294
Now, please.

567
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:04,662
Commander, l'd advise that
Major Kira remain on Jeraddo

568
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:08,567
for humanitarian reasons....

569
00:29:08,603 --> 00:29:10,628
How long?

570
00:29:10,672 --> 00:29:12,196
The next day or two.

571
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,708
For the next day or two, sir.

572
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:16,142
Thank you, Doctor.

573
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:18,509
l will consider that request.

574
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:19,945
Dismissed.

575
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:35,295
What's that?

576
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,854
lt's for deep bruises.

577
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:38,866
Don't ask me why it works.

578
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,595
l'm not the doctor.

579
00:29:40,635 --> 00:29:44,093
What are they going to do
to you for staying here?

580
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:47,768
Probably the same thing
they're going to do to you.

581
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:51,404
l don't really know.

582
00:29:51,446 --> 00:29:53,937
What are you so angry about?

583
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:56,142
l don't really know.

584
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:04,788
When l was very small

585
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:07,920
l remember there was this tree
right outside my window.

586
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:09,657
lt was the ugliest

587
00:30:09,697 --> 00:30:12,962
most gnarled and battered
old tree l'd ever seen.

588
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:15,400
Even the birds
stayed away from it.

589
00:30:15,437 --> 00:30:17,837
But you loved it, huh?

590
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:19,840
Hated it.

591
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:21,967
Because it had grown so huge

592
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:25,342
its branches blocked out the sun
for <i>kellipates</i>

593
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,816
and its roots buried themselves
so deep in the soil

594
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,977
nothing else could grow there.

595
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:34,613
Oh, it was a big,
selfish, annoying...

596
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:36,089
Nasty...

597
00:30:36,124 --> 00:30:39,582
Nasty... nasty old tree.

598
00:30:39,627 --> 00:30:41,686
Hmm.

599
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:45,995
Sounds to me like it had
a lot of character.

600
00:30:49,003 --> 00:30:50,994
A lot.

601
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,537
So what happened?

602
00:30:54,576 --> 00:30:56,203
Did you cut it down?

603
00:30:56,244 --> 00:30:58,680
l don't know yet.

604
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,169
l don't know yet.

605
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:01,307
Sisko to Kira.

606
00:31:04,152 --> 00:31:05,619
Commander.

607
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:07,621
l'm preparing to beam down.

608
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:10,453
l don't think
that's a good idea.

609
00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:14,690
Major, either l'm coming down
or you're coming up.

610
00:31:16,598 --> 00:31:19,431
He doesn't have much faith
in you, does he?

611
00:31:33,381 --> 00:31:35,212
Nerys.

612
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:39,419
This is still my home.

613
00:31:41,523 --> 00:31:43,491
What do you want?

614
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:45,152
l'm here to see Major Kira.

615
00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:47,286
Well, she doesn't
want to see you.

616
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:48,955
Neither do l.

617
00:31:48,997 --> 00:31:50,294
Wait a minute.

618
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:51,628
Don't speak for me.

619
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,634
You know, you're causing
a lot of trouble.

620
00:31:53,668 --> 00:31:56,637
l can't tell you how delighted
l am to hear that.

621
00:31:56,671 --> 00:31:58,639
How many of you
Federated uniforms

622
00:31:58,673 --> 00:32:00,538
you going to send after me?

623
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:01,940
40, 50?

624
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,308
l don't think
it will come to that.

625
00:32:04,345 --> 00:32:07,246
That depends on how bad
you want to get rid of me.

626
00:32:07,282 --> 00:32:09,944
Mr. Mullibok, l'm here
because l'm concerned

627
00:32:10,018 --> 00:32:11,451
about my First Officer.

628
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:14,216
What about her?

629
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:17,554
By staying here,
she's jeopardizing her career.

630
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:22,563
Would you go back to bed?

631
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:24,565
You quit telling me what to do.

632
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,896
Major

633
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:27,561
can l see you outside
for a minute?

634
00:32:29,003 --> 00:32:31,301
Talk to him as long as you want.

635
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:34,308
Why don't you tell him
the story about your tree?

636
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:35,969
Be quiet.

637
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,537
There was this big,
ugly tree, uh...

638
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:41,640
Go on.

639
00:32:41,683 --> 00:32:43,708
Never mind.

640
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,888
l can see why you like him.

641
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:53,985
What can l do for you,
Commander?

642
00:32:54,095 --> 00:32:56,996
You and l have a material
subsistence report to finish

643
00:32:57,098 --> 00:32:58,998
by the end of the week.

644
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,660
l don't think l'm going to
be able to help you with that.

645
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:03,933
lt's part of
the liaison officer's job.

646
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:05,369
l know.

647
00:33:05,406 --> 00:33:09,035
l don't like the prospect
of having to break in a new one.

648
00:33:09,077 --> 00:33:11,102
You have a job to do here, Major

649
00:33:11,145 --> 00:33:12,703
and you're not doing it.

650
00:33:12,747 --> 00:33:14,214
lt's not that simple.

651
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:16,217
l'm not saying it's simple.

652
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:18,242
l'm saying it can't wait.

653
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:22,223
Look... l understand

654
00:33:22,257 --> 00:33:25,590
you're used to sympathizing
with the underdog.

655
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:30,360
You've spent your life fighting
to overcome impossible odds

656
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:32,366
just like he's doing.

657
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,097
But you have to realize
something, Major.

658
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:39,834
You're on the other side now.

659
00:33:43,444 --> 00:33:46,277
Pretty uncomfortable, isn't it?

660
00:33:49,617 --> 00:33:52,552
lt's awful.

661
00:34:01,462 --> 00:34:04,590
When l first met you, Major

662
00:34:04,632 --> 00:34:08,796
l thought you were
hostile and arrogant

663
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:11,186
but l was wrong.

664
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:15,915
Bajor needs you, and l need you.

665
00:34:15,991 --> 00:34:17,754
l like you

666
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:21,125
and l don't want you to be hurt.

667
00:34:22,964 --> 00:34:26,764
So, as a friend,
l'm here to remind you

668
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:29,269
that his fate
is already decided.

669
00:34:29,304 --> 00:34:31,135
Yours isn't.

670
00:34:36,144 --> 00:34:38,169
Thank you.

671
00:34:39,547 --> 00:34:43,643
There will be a runabout
standing by.

672
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,154
One to beam up.

673
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,587
Mullibok.

674
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:24,956
Mullibok.

675
00:35:26,294 --> 00:35:27,625
No!

676
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:35,265
You're...
you're hurting her.

677
00:35:35,303 --> 00:35:36,600
Let go.

678
00:35:36,638 --> 00:35:37,935
Easy.

679
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:39,269
Lussilla...

680
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:41,104
Easy.

681
00:35:41,142 --> 00:35:46,136
l told you...
take your hands off me.

682
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:01,557
That's right.

683
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:03,757
lt's okay.

684
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:07,564
Everything's going to be fine.

685
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:10,230
Oh...

686
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:12,239
it's you.

687
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:15,572
You were having a bad dream.

688
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:19,569
Not just a bad dream--
bad memories.

689
00:36:19,614 --> 00:36:22,913
l didn't say anything,
did l?

690
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:24,919
No.

691
00:36:24,953 --> 00:36:26,250
You thirsty?

692
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:27,584
No.

693
00:36:27,622 --> 00:36:28,919
Hungry?

694
00:36:28,957 --> 00:36:30,948
No. Leave me alone.

695
00:36:32,627 --> 00:36:34,959
Go back to sleep.

696
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:38,421
Where you going?

697
00:36:38,466 --> 00:36:41,924
l'd like to get some sleep, too.

698
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:45,632
Fine, bring the chair over here.

699
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:48,471
Well, are you my nurse, or not?

700
00:36:55,984 --> 00:36:58,452
ls this better?

701
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:01,546
Are you going to talk all night?

702
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:03,921
Let me sleep.

703
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:34,078
Nog, l'm waiting.

704
00:37:34,122 --> 00:37:35,589
l'm thinking.

705
00:37:35,623 --> 00:37:36,920
About what?

706
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,756
Latinum, and how
we don't have any.

707
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:41,785
All we have is dirt.

708
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,424
How many times do
l have to tell you?

709
00:37:44,466 --> 00:37:46,058
lt's not dirt-- it's land.

710
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,092
What are we supposed
to do with this land?

711
00:37:49,137 --> 00:37:50,764
Sell it, l guess.

712
00:37:50,805 --> 00:37:52,033
To who?

713
00:37:52,073 --> 00:37:53,938
Why do l have
to think of everything?

714
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:55,942
We should have kept
the stem bolts.

715
00:37:56,044 --> 00:37:57,773
Land is better than bolts.

716
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:59,336
How do you know?

717
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,814
You can build things on land.

718
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,444
You can't build anything
without bolts.

719
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,411
Just throw down a card.

720
00:38:11,426 --> 00:38:13,724
And you say they're based
here on the station?

721
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:14,887
That's correct.

722
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:16,896
The Noh-Jay Consortium?

723
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:20,332
No, never heard of it.

724
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:21,596
Why do you ask?

725
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:22,603
l was contacted

726
00:38:22,637 --> 00:38:24,434
by a government
official this morning.

727
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:26,440
They want to build
a reclamation facility

728
00:38:26,474 --> 00:38:28,908
on a strip of land owned
by four different people.

729
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:31,241
Three of them
have agreed to sell

730
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:32,576
but the government

731
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:34,912
doesn't know
how to reach the fourth--

732
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,576
this Noh-Jay Consortium.

733
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:38,586
You mean the government
can't build

734
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,588
without that one piece of land.

735
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:41,919
Apparently not.

736
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:44,254
What a wonderful
opportunity for profit.

737
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:47,750
l told you that land
was better than bolts.

738
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:49,319
And you think l'm part
of this Consortium?

739
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:51,525
l think very little
goes on here

740
00:38:51,566 --> 00:38:53,193
without your knowledge.

741
00:38:53,234 --> 00:38:55,464
True. This time, however

742
00:38:55,503 --> 00:38:58,529
someone has failed
to include me.

743
00:38:58,573 --> 00:39:02,373
Are you telling me
you're not involved?

744
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:06,312
Oh, not yet,
but that will be remedied.

745
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:08,281
You can tell the Bajorans

746
00:39:08,316 --> 00:39:12,013
l'll be opening negotiations
with them shortly.

747
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:31,062
Let's see.

748
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:35,906
Who on this station
is clever enough?

749
00:39:35,944 --> 00:39:37,241
Uncle Quark?

750
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:38,575
Not now.

751
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:39,910
But, Uncle Quark...

752
00:39:39,948 --> 00:39:41,575
Go sweep the floor.

753
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:42,913
lt's important.

754
00:39:42,951 --> 00:39:44,919
All right, make it fast.

755
00:39:44,953 --> 00:39:49,253
l have a business opportunity
that might interest you.

756
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,757
Huh?

757
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:56,458
lt'll only cost you five bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

758
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:06,295
Nog...

759
00:40:58,483 --> 00:40:59,780
Any pain?

760
00:40:59,818 --> 00:41:01,376
Just a little sore.

761
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:04,388
l was starting to think
you'd sleep all day.

762
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:08,153
That's because l was taking care
of you all night.

763
00:41:08,193 --> 00:41:12,892
l don't recall
asking you to do that.

764
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:14,899
l can handle this.

765
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,901
Go get something to eat.

766
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:19,062
There isn't time.

767
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,939
You're finally leaving?

768
00:41:29,014 --> 00:41:30,948
Last one.

769
00:41:44,229 --> 00:41:47,790
l didn't think
l'd ever finish it.

770
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,926
lt's finished.

771
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:53,131
Nothing to do but fire it up.

772
00:42:34,112 --> 00:42:36,080
What's all this?

773
00:42:36,114 --> 00:42:37,741
You finished your work.

774
00:42:37,782 --> 00:42:40,080
Now l have to finish mine.

775
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:42,086
But you don't want to.

776
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,418
l could use a friend on Bajor.

777
00:42:44,456 --> 00:42:46,014
l'd like it to be you.

778
00:42:46,057 --> 00:42:52,360
As long as that cottage
is standing, l stay here.

779
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:57,430
What the hell are you doing?!

780
00:42:57,469 --> 00:42:59,437
Saving your life.

781
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:45,905
So you chose your uniform
over me after all.

782
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:47,441
That's not true.

783
00:43:47,485 --> 00:43:49,783
The time
l've spent here with you

784
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:52,585
has meant so much to me,
but it's over.

785
00:43:52,624 --> 00:43:55,252
lt's time we went on
with our lives--

786
00:43:55,293 --> 00:43:56,555
mine and yours.

787
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:59,688
You say you're my friend.

788
00:43:59,731 --> 00:44:02,359
Prove it.

789
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,891
Use that weapon on me.

790
00:44:07,906 --> 00:44:11,000
l can't.

791
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:13,738
lf l leave here, l'll die.

792
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:15,040
No, you won't.

793
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,775
l won't let you.

794
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:29,587
Two to beam up.
