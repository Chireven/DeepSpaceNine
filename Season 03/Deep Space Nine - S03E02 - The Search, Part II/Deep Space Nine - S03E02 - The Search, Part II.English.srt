1
00:00:02,694 --> 00:00:06,152
Last time on
<i>Star Trek</i>: <i>Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:07,859
Our mission is to take
the <i>Defiant</i>

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:09,867
into the Gamma Quadrant
and try to find

4
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:12,631
the leaders of the
Dominion, the Founders.

5
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:15,071
What the hell is wrong
with Starfleet?!

6
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:16,506
How could they do this to him?

7
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,406
This has been a long time
coming, Major.

8
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:20,809
Starfleet has never been
happy with the Constable.

9
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:22,643
l want him to stay
as much as you do

10
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:24,114
but he has to want to stay.

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,312
Ever since we've come
into the Gamma Quadrant...

12
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:32,415
l've had this feeling...
of being drawn somewhere

13
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:34,357
to a specific place--

14
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:38,419
the Omarion Nebula.

15
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:00,039
The last time l saw the <i>Defiant,</i>
she was dead in space

16
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:03,646
and surrounded
by Jem'Hadar ships.

17
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,089
Sisko? Bashir?

18
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,517
l don't know.

19
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,570
Welcome home.

20
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,538
And now the conclusion.

21
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:43,792
You really are just like me,
aren't you?

22
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,854
Yes.

23
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:56,398
And you're saying,
this is where l'm from?

24
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:58,875
This is your home.

25
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,969
Ah, l wish l could remember it.

26
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:03,879
lt's understandable
that you cannot.

27
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,247
You were still newly formed
when you left us.

28
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:07,717
Newly formed?

29
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,220
You mean, l was an infant?

30
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:12,615
An infant, yes.

31
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:15,023
Ah. l suspected as much.

32
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,496
Tell me, do l have
any family at all?

33
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,327
Of course.

34
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:23,266
l'd like to meet them,
if that's possible.

35
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:25,633
You already have.

36
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,403
We are all part
of the Great Link.

37
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,275
ls that all of us,
or are there others?

38
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:37,179
Odo, this isn't
a police investigation.

39
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:39,445
l'm aware of that, Major.

40
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:42,476
Well, then stop interrogating
these people.

41
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:46,855
This is the moment you've been
waiting for all your life.

42
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:48,382
Enjoy it.

43
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:54,024
He really is happy to be here.

44
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:55,760
Aren't you?

45
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,826
Yes, of course.

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,468
lt's just that this
is all very sudden.

47
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:06,841
And you have many questions.

48
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:08,641
Yes.

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,341
Please...

50
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:17,250
what exactly is this Great Link?

51
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:20,816
The Link is the very foundation
of our society.

52
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,487
lt provides a meaning
to our existence.

53
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:26,292
lt is the merging
of form and thought

54
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,822
the sharing of idea
and sensation.

55
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:32,268
ls something wrong?

56
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:41,710
l've... lived
a very solitary life.

57
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:45,045
That's unfortunate,
but necessary

58
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,517
as you'll learn in time.

59
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:51,181
But now, that part
of your life is over.

60
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:52,916
You're home.

61
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,825
What are you doing?

62
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,328
Take it.

63
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,829
But it's not time.

64
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,161
He isn't ready.

65
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,893
He's been gone too long.

66
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:06,097
He needs to remember,
if only for a moment.

67
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:08,264
Don't be afraid.

68
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,998
Odo...

69
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,940
What have you done to him?

70
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,500
l allowed him
to experience the Link.

71
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:49,644
Odo!

72
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,345
Yes, Major.

73
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:55,353
Are you all right?

74
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:56,979
What happened?

75
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:01,082
l'm not sure.

76
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,986
But l know one thing.

77
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:07,692
She's right.

78
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:13,497
l am... home.

79
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,132
Commander's Log, supplemental.

80
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:25,035
lt's been six days since
we had to abandon the <i>Defiant</i>

81
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:28,006
after the Jem'Hadar attack.

82
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,235
We still don't know

83
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:31,709
what happened
to the rest of the crew.

84
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:35,943
Doctor Bashir and l have plotted
a course back to the wormhole.

85
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:39,008
Whether the shuttle
can get us back there or not

86
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:41,714
is questionable at best.

87
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:44,053
Our engines are failing

88
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:47,457
our external sensors
are barely functioning

89
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:53,057
and life support systems
are at 20% and dropping.

90
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,731
But other than that,
we couldn't be in better shape.

91
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:00,433
l thought you were sleeping.

92
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:03,271
From the sound of things,
l wish l were.

93
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:05,038
lt could be worse.

94
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:07,406
l believe you.

95
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,642
Do you think it's
some kind of tractor beam?

96
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:10,979
Could be.

97
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:13,679
l wish these sensors
were working.

98
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,851
Now what?

99
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:24,552
Whoa, hey, don't shoot.

100
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:26,224
We surrender.

101
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,324
Chief, Dax.

102
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,028
l don't believe it.

103
00:08:29,102 --> 00:08:31,263
We thought you'd been
captured by the Jem'Hadar.

104
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:32,271
Well, we had our doubts

105
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:33,772
about ever seeing you again,
either, Julian.

106
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:35,035
We've been searching
for you for days.

107
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:36,234
What about the others?

108
00:08:36,276 --> 00:08:37,709
No sign of them yet

109
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:40,269
but we still have ships
out looking for them.

110
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:42,372
Meanwhile, our orders are

111
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,440
to get you back to DS9
as soon as possible.

112
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:47,419
There are big things
happening there, Benjamin.

113
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:49,513
l think you're in
for a surprise.

114
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:58,287
This is beautiful.

115
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,960
How long do they plan
on making us wait here?

116
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,663
We've only been here
a few hours.

117
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:07,764
Ha! l finally return home

118
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:10,002
and they still treat me
like an outsider.

119
00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:12,873
Oh, believe me, you're not
the outsider here, l am.

120
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:14,379
You?

121
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:16,746
l'm the one they
don't trust, not you.

122
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:18,410
How perceptive, Major.

123
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:21,352
lf our history
has taught us anything

124
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:25,153
it's to avoid contact
with solids whenever possible.

125
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:26,180
Solids?

126
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:29,195
Our name for mono-forms
like yourself

127
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:32,130
who will never know
the joys of the Great Link.

128
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:33,689
l don't intend to stay long.

129
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:36,759
There's a chance Sisko and
the others survived the attack.

130
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:38,634
l'm going to go back
to the shuttle

131
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:39,763
and try contacting them.

132
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:41,137
l'm sorry, l cannot allow you

133
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:43,802
to send any communications
from the planet's surface.

134
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:47,506
They could be traced back here.

135
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:49,174
We value our isolation.

136
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,308
Yes, of course.

137
00:09:56,756 --> 00:10:00,522
Tell me, Odo, have you made
good use of the arboretum?

138
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:06,327
ln what way?

139
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:10,769
By assuming the various shapes
surrounding you.

140
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:13,966
Why would l do that?

141
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:17,033
To become a thing
is to know a thing.

142
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:22,013
To assume its form is to begin
to understand its existence.

143
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:24,949
Understand it?
How?

144
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:26,281
Living among the solids

145
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:28,753
has damaged you far worse
than l realized.

146
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:31,848
lt has left you ignorant
of the gifts you possess.

147
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:38,990
Then teach me
what l need to know.

148
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:41,091
l'll do what l can.

149
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:50,367
But in the end,
this is another journey

150
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,538
you'll have to make on your own.

151
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:57,682
And when it is over

152
00:10:57,717 --> 00:11:01,278
you'll be ready to take
your place in the Great Link.

153
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:19,227
Odo.

154
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,076
l'd like to be alone,
if you don't mind.

155
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:28,511
All right.

156
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:29,742
But if you need me

157
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:32,580
l'll be in the shuttle
trying to contact Sisko.

158
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:33,881
Don't worry.

159
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,718
When l was in the resistance,
l learned to camouflage

160
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:39,088
subspace messages
using quantum interference.

161
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,217
l taught the method
to Commander Sisko.

162
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,990
lf anyone intercepts the signal,
all they'll read

163
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,396
is elevated levels
of background radiation.

164
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:49,595
Good luck.

165
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:51,001
You, too.

166
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:03,615
Well, Commander,
it appears your mission

167
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,675
was an even greater
success than we hoped.

168
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:07,481
So l'm told.

169
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,420
Has the delegation
from the Founders

170
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:10,786
arrived on the station yet?

171
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:12,814
They're already meeting
with representatives

172
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:14,053
from the Federation Council

173
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:16,755
and a dozen other
Alpha Quadrant alliances.

174
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:18,525
We're hoping to have
a treaty signed

175
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:22,159
within a matter of days,
and we have you to thank for it.

176
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,931
Actually, it's Lieutenant Dax
and Chief O'Brien

177
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:26,666
who deserve most of the credit.

178
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:27,900
Well, we were lucky
the Jem'Hadar

179
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,066
handed us over to the Founders.

180
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:31,609
We just had to convince them
we were serious about peace.

181
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:33,669
Actually, it didn't take
that much convincing.

182
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:37,809
l suppose the only question is,
can we trust them?

183
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:43,345
lt's a risk, l know

184
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:46,825
but both the Federation Council
and Starfleet Command

185
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:48,759
believe it's one worth taking.

186
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:51,855
By the way, Commander, one of
the Founders asked to see you

187
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:54,332
the moment you arrive
on the station.

188
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:56,062
Asked to see me?

189
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:58,093
lf you're not too busy.

190
00:12:58,137 --> 00:13:01,664
Well, l suppose l could
spare a few minutes.

191
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:11,175
Commander Sisko, come in.

192
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:14,948
l've looked forward
to meeting you.

193
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:16,818
l am Borath.

194
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:19,791
And you're one of the Founders?

195
00:13:19,826 --> 00:13:21,157
That's correct.

196
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:22,923
You seem surprised.

197
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:26,056
Not really, only...

198
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:29,566
l hadn't realized till now

199
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:31,399
l've already met
one of your people.

200
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,997
You're referring
to Eris, of course.

201
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,066
Yes, she is one of us.

202
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,203
Though she couldn't
very well admit it

203
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,475
while you were pointing
a phaser at her.

204
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:45,075
l am glad to see
you're not holding one now.

205
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:46,312
Do l need one?

206
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:47,649
Oh, not at all.

207
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:49,416
You seem skeptical.

208
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:50,979
Can you blame me?

209
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:53,890
No, l realize

210
00:13:53,926 --> 00:13:55,860
you have no reason
to trust the Dominion

211
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:57,920
but you must understand

212
00:13:57,964 --> 00:14:00,364
that we were only trying
to defend ourselves.

213
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,559
From what?

214
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:02,761
We felt threatened

215
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:06,294
by your incursions
into the Gamma Quadrant.

216
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:08,157
And now?

217
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,724
Commander, you risked your life

218
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,627
to bring us a message
of peace and friendship.

219
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:17,257
We chose to accept your offer.

220
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:22,865
Would you have
rather we refused?

221
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,634
No.

222
00:14:24,673 --> 00:14:27,608
Good. Because
believe me, Commander

223
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:32,740
an alliance between the Dominion
and the Federation

224
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:36,046
will be beneficial
to both our people.

225
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,396
Doctor, welcome back.

226
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,524
Why, thank you, Garak.

227
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:52,625
lt's good to be back.

228
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:53,635
Yes.

229
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:54,693
Business keeping you busy?

230
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:58,537
Oh, the tailoring business
or the spy business?

231
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:00,405
l'm joking, of course.

232
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,875
Of course.

233
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,377
l've missed you.

234
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:05,937
l've been genuinely
concerned for your safety.

235
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:07,972
Lunch hasn't been
the same without you.

236
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,210
That's very kind of you
to say so, Garak.

237
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:12,550
Hopefully, things'll
start getting back

238
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:13,919
to normal around here.

239
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,856
Oh, l doubt that's going
to happen, Doctor.

240
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:16,915
l doubt that very much.

241
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,926
And why is that?

242
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,360
There's an old saying
on Cardassia:

243
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:21,954
''Enemies make
dangerous friends.''

244
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:23,191
And l fear the Dominion

245
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:24,995
will make a very dangerous
friend indeed.

246
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:27,763
l take it you're referring
to the peace talks.

247
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,101
Exactly. l'm afraid
these treaty negotiations

248
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,607
are a mistake we're going
to live to regret.

249
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,405
ls that your opinion
or the opinion

250
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:37,002
of the Cardassian
Central Command?

251
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:38,704
The former, l assure you.

252
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:41,875
The Central Command is very
much in favor of this treaty

253
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:45,819
which, as far as l'm concerned,
only justifies my fears.

254
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:47,481
Well, l, for one

255
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:50,321
hope you're worrying
about nothing.

256
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,691
Subcommander T'Rul.

257
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:53,695
You all right?

258
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:54,753
l'm fine.

259
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:57,265
l had a minor disagreement
with some Starfleet

260
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,357
security officers.

261
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,129
They refused
to allow me to speak

262
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,296
with the Federation's
negotiating team.

263
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,135
Well, what did you want
to talk to them about?

264
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,936
l wanted to protest
the exclusion

265
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:08,807
of the Romulan Empire
from the treaty negotiations.

266
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,142
l wasn't aware the Romulans
had been excluded.

267
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,842
Every great power in the Alpha
Quadrant has been invited

268
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:16,214
to participate except for us.

269
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,583
Then there must be some mistake.

270
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,316
The mistake is thinking
the Romulan Empire will stand by

271
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:24,326
and allow such a betrayal
to go unchallenged.

272
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,854
Believe me, Doctor, if a treaty
is signed without our approval

273
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:31,161
it will mean war.

274
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:38,806
Still feel that l'm worrying
about nothing, Doctor?

275
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:42,674
Computer, transmit
a subspace signal

276
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,009
using a narrow
theta band frequency

277
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,174
shifted into
a background radiation domain.

278
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:48,843
Working.

279
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,751
l hope you're out there,
Commander.

280
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:53,516
Unable to transmit signal

281
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,922
due to external interference
at all frequencies.

282
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,190
ldentify source of interference.

283
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:03,289
lnterference generated
by thermal radiation

284
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:05,630
from a subterranean
power source.

285
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,828
Locate power source.

286
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,963
Power source is located

287
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:12,404
four kilometers
beneath the planet's surface.

288
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:15,604
Coordinates 127 mark 3.

289
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:17,339
Can you identify?

290
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:23,749
Unable to identify due to an
unknown poly-metallic substance

291
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:24,980
within the surrounding rock.

292
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,554
Any luck, Major?

293
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:30,547
No, some kind of power source
is interfering with my signal.

294
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,423
Do you have any idea
what it could be?

295
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:33,723
l haven't a clue.

296
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:36,959
Are you all right?

297
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:42,528
l have spent the last two hours
shape-shifting--

298
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:45,233
rocks, flowers, trees--

299
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:48,573
l have been everything
in that... garden.

300
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,636
And?

301
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,238
And nothing.

302
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,614
Oh, l can become
a rock all right

303
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:59,519
but l have no more of an idea
what it is to be a rock

304
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,250
than l did before.

305
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:05,059
l'm not really sure
what that means.

306
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:07,857
l'm not sure either

307
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:11,593
and that's... unfortunate.

308
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:20,174
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l have to return to my bucket.

309
00:18:26,782 --> 00:18:30,411
Commander, Admiral Nechayev
is here to see you.

310
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:33,012
Send her in.

311
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,658
You asked to see me, Commander?

312
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:38,091
l understand that the Romulans

313
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:39,991
haven't been invited
to the peace talks.

314
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:41,757
That's correct.

315
00:18:41,797 --> 00:18:43,492
l was wondering
what prompted that decision.

316
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:46,262
The Founders requested
that they be excluded.

317
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:47,563
Did they say why?

318
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:48,900
They felt the Romulans

319
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,837
would be
a disruptive influence.

320
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:53,808
More disruptive
than the Cardassians?

321
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,571
They seemed to think so.

322
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:58,341
Do you have a problem
with this, Commander?

323
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,076
Whether l have a problem with it
isn't the point.

324
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:03,414
lt's the Romulans
we have to worry about.

325
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:05,545
Commander, if this treaty
is signed

326
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:07,350
and l'm confident it will be

327
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:10,552
we'll never have to worry
about the Romulans again.

328
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:11,650
Are you sure of that?

329
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:12,819
Quite sure.

330
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,624
After all, what chance
would they have

331
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:17,530
against the combined power
of our new alliance?

332
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:19,932
They wouldn't have
much of a chance at all.

333
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:21,959
l'm glad we agree.

334
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:23,665
Believe me, Commander

335
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,935
the Federation carefully
weighed all the options

336
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:28,169
before entering
into these peace talks.

337
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:31,707
l realize that.

338
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:35,376
Then we have nothing
further to discuss, do we?

339
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:47,493
Why do you dislike
humanoids so much?

340
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:49,463
l know they have their flaws

341
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:53,491
but l've found many of them
to be kind, decent people.

342
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:56,129
Like Major Kira?

343
00:19:56,171 --> 00:19:58,139
Yes, like Major Kira.

344
00:19:58,173 --> 00:20:01,438
Then you've been more fortunate
than most changelings.

345
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:02,636
''Changelings?''

346
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,873
You recognize the term?

347
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:09,475
Hmm. l've been called
a ''changeling'' on occasion.

348
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:12,453
lt's a name given
to us by the solids.

349
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,682
They meant it as an insult

350
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:18,284
but, in defiance,
we took it and made it our own.

351
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:21,057
Go on, please.

352
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:27,392
The Great Link tells us
that many years ago

353
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:31,429
our people roamed the stars,
searching out other races

354
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:34,965
so we could add
to our knowledge of the galaxy.

355
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,036
We went in peace,
but too often we were met

356
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,775
with suspicion,
hatred and violence.

357
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:42,283
Why?

358
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:46,651
The solids feared
our metamorphic abilities.

359
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:50,317
So we were beaten,
hunted and killed.

360
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,520
Finally, we arrived here.

361
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:57,157
And here, safe in our isolation,
we made our home.

362
00:20:57,199 --> 00:21:01,546
Tell me... why was l sent away?

363
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,442
Because even in our isolation

364
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:06,245
we desired to learn
more about the galaxy.

365
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:08,616
You were one of 100 infants
sent off

366
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:10,587
to gain that knowledge for us.

367
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:12,749
But how could you be sure

368
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,917
that we'd find
our way back here?

369
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,586
You had no choice.

370
00:21:16,628 --> 00:21:18,255
The urge to return home

371
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:20,491
was implanted
in your genetic makeup.

372
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:22,362
And now, thanks
to the passageway

373
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,766
you're the first one
to return to us.

374
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:26,895
We weren't expecting you
so soon.

375
00:21:26,938 --> 00:21:28,565
When were you expecting me?

376
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:31,234
Not for another 300 years.

377
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,812
How long was l away?

378
00:21:43,855 --> 00:21:46,415
A long time.

379
00:21:46,457 --> 00:21:50,689
But now, all that matters
is that you're here.

380
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:55,390
lt's...

381
00:21:57,235 --> 00:22:00,898
different than l
imagined it would be.

382
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:06,843
Whatever you imagined,
l promise it will be better.

383
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:50,681
Odo, are you here?

384
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,252
Odo...

385
00:22:56,294 --> 00:23:01,095
l'm going to try to track
the source of the interference.

386
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:04,260
lf l can't find it
and neutralize it

387
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:06,896
l'm going to have to leave here

388
00:23:06,938 --> 00:23:09,634
and try to find
Sisko and the others.

389
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:19,272
l'm really glad
you made it home, Odo.

390
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:23,481
l know everything is going
to work out just fine.

391
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,617
l don't believe it.

392
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:29,319
l'm talking to a tree.

393
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:34,321
You're probably not
even here, are you?

394
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:53,442
Why would shape-shifters
need a door?

395
00:23:55,787 --> 00:23:57,914
Kira to computer.

396
00:23:57,955 --> 00:24:01,914
Scan the area dead ahead of me
for 100 meters.

397
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:05,622
Unable to penetrate
due to interference.

398
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:20,268
Excuse me.

399
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:21,938
Pardon me.

400
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:24,607
After you.

401
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:27,277
Look out.
Coming through.

402
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:30,048
Sorry to keep you
waiting, gentlemen.

403
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:32,920
That's two synthales,
on the house.

404
00:24:32,957 --> 00:24:35,448
What's put you
in such a good humor?

405
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:37,188
l have inside information

406
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:40,129
that the peace agreement
is about to be finalized.

407
00:24:40,164 --> 00:24:41,961
And where did you get
this information?

408
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:44,399
From one of your friends
on the Federation Council?

409
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:46,733
lf you must know, l overheard
two Jem'Hadar officers.

410
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:49,638
And you believed them?

411
00:24:49,674 --> 00:24:51,471
l don't see why not.

412
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:53,704
Oh, l know we got off
to a rocky start

413
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:55,575
but they're not so bad.

414
00:24:55,613 --> 00:24:56,910
Really.

415
00:24:56,948 --> 00:24:58,882
l think they have the gene.

416
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,213
What gene?

417
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:01,377
The gambling gene.

418
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:03,353
They've barely been
on this station a week

419
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:05,753
and already they can hardly
drag themselves away

420
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,257
from the dabo table.

421
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,589
How fortunate for you.

422
00:25:09,627 --> 00:25:12,824
How fortunate for all of us.

423
00:25:12,864 --> 00:25:15,833
You see, l have a dream...

424
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:19,166
a dream that one day
all people--

425
00:25:19,203 --> 00:25:25,108
human, Jem'Hadar, Ferengi,
Cardassians--

426
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:27,940
will stand together in peace...

427
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:30,243
around my dabo tables.

428
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:32,511
You're a regular visionary,
Quark.

429
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,780
l am, aren't l?

430
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:39,615
You're in my way!

431
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:41,318
Sorry.

432
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:44,459
Now, look!

433
00:25:55,273 --> 00:25:58,765
Gentlemen, please,
remember my vision.

434
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,276
That's enough.

435
00:26:01,946 --> 00:26:04,073
All right.
What's going on here?

436
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:06,583
He addressed me
in a disrespectful tone.

437
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:07,914
That's a lie.

438
00:26:07,952 --> 00:26:10,318
Easy, Doctor.
We're all friends here.

439
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:11,821
Tell him that.

440
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:14,416
l'll see this
doesn't happen again.

441
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,358
l expect you will.

442
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,927
ls that it?

443
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:23,433
You're just going
to let him walk away?

444
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:27,028
Our orders are to give
the Jem'Hadar a wide berth.

445
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:28,231
Look, l know
what the orders say

446
00:26:28,272 --> 00:26:29,364
but he attacked Chief O'Brien

447
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:31,307
and we have rules here
against that sort of thing.

448
00:26:31,342 --> 00:26:34,038
l'm aware of station
regulations, Doctor.

449
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:35,943
However,
the Jem'Hadar are not.

450
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:37,241
We have to allow them

451
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:39,374
some time to get used
to our customs.

452
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:40,884
So, in the meantime

453
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:43,512
they're free to do
whatever they want.

454
00:26:43,554 --> 00:26:44,851
Remember that

455
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:47,983
before you get into
another brawl with them.

456
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,857
Dad, pass me the potatoes.

457
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,527
Dad?

458
00:26:57,568 --> 00:26:59,229
Yes, Jake.

459
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,261
The potatoes.

460
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,407
Oh.

461
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:05,739
Dad, is something wrong?

462
00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:08,244
Not really.

463
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:12,613
l'm just a little preoccupied,
that's all.

464
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:17,652
lt's these Dominion
negotiations.

465
00:27:17,688 --> 00:27:18,916
What about them?

466
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:22,153
Well, it's all happening
behind closed doors.

467
00:27:22,193 --> 00:27:26,596
l... l guess l just feel...

468
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,622
out of the loop.

469
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:32,067
There's something going on,
isn't there?

470
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:34,094
Like what?

471
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:36,333
You tell me.

472
00:27:40,144 --> 00:27:41,611
Come in.

473
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:43,875
Benjamin.

474
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:46,405
Did you know about this?

475
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,815
Know about what?

476
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:49,683
l being transferred
to the <i>Lexington.</i>

477
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,244
l'm their new Science Officer.

478
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:52,516
There must be some mistake.

479
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:53,955
The orders are right here.

480
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:55,616
Let me see this.

481
00:27:58,062 --> 00:27:59,529
l don't believe it.

482
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:00,996
Bashir to Sisko.

483
00:28:01,032 --> 00:28:02,294
Go ahead, Doctor.

484
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,393
Commander, l need to talk
to you about the Jem'Hadar.

485
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,065
l want to know
what the hell is going on!

486
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:13,702
Commander, l don't appreciate
your barging in here.

487
00:28:13,744 --> 00:28:15,473
l want to know
why my Science Officer's

488
00:28:15,513 --> 00:28:17,140
been transferred
without my consent.

489
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:19,046
l want to know
why my Chief of Operations

490
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,277
is lying in the lnfirmary

491
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:23,081
while the Jem'Hadar who beat him
is free to walk the station.

492
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,281
And l want to know
why the Federation is willing

493
00:28:25,322 --> 00:28:27,654
to risk a war with the Romulans
to form an alliance

494
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:30,317
with a group of people that we
hardly know and barely trust!

495
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,542
Are you finished?

496
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,576
l haven't even begun!

497
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,611
Admiral, l think you

498
00:28:35,655 --> 00:28:39,921
should tell Commander Sisko
what he wants to know.

499
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,190
All right, l suppose
he deserves

500
00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:44,561
to be the first
to hear the news.

501
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:45,929
What news?

502
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:48,400
The Federation is pulling
out of this sector.

503
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,266
All Starfleet
personnel currently

504
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:52,498
stationed on DS9
will be reassigned

505
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:53,836
to other posts.

506
00:28:53,874 --> 00:28:54,841
Yourself included.

507
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,035
What about Bajor?

508
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:59,443
Our plans for Bajor
are on hold for the time being.

509
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:02,107
From now on, Bajor will be
the Dominion's responsibility.

510
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:04,310
They'll be running this station.

511
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:07,787
And you're telling me that the
Bajorans have agreed to this?

512
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:09,311
We're confident
they'll have no objections.

513
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:11,586
And if they do object,
what then?

514
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,422
You send in the Jem'Hadar?

515
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,123
The Jem'Hadar are used
only against our enemies.

516
00:29:17,164 --> 00:29:20,429
Bajor will be protected,
Commander.

517
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,991
We'll see to it.

518
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:23,593
What about the wormhole?

519
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,434
Will they get
to protect that, too?

520
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,531
lt's the price of peace,
Benjamin.

521
00:29:27,574 --> 00:29:30,873
Well, if you ask me,
the price is too damned high.

522
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:34,813
What is the Federation supposed
to get out of all of this?

523
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,713
Our friendship.

524
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,048
lsn't that enough?

525
00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:41,485
And you, Benjamin,
get a promotion...

526
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:43,716
Captain Sisko.

527
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:44,917
lt's an important step

528
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:47,425
toward that Admiralcy
you've always wanted.

529
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:50,624
l want a chance to speak to
the Federation negotiating team

530
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,222
before this treaty is signed!

531
00:29:52,265 --> 00:29:53,926
lt's too late for that, Ben.

532
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,662
The treaty was signed
late this afternoon.

533
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:03,837
lt's the beginning
of a new era, Commander

534
00:30:03,877 --> 00:30:05,936
and you helped make it possible.

535
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:07,469
Congratulations.

536
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:26,421
Odo.

537
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:29,128
l've been waiting for you.

538
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:30,136
Major!

539
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:34,197
l have just had the most
remarkable experience.

540
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:37,972
For a few moments,
l actually felt what it was like

541
00:30:38,011 --> 00:30:40,980
to be an Arbazon vulture.

542
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:44,983
The air currents
beneath my wings

543
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:49,351
the exhilaration of soaring
above the treetops.

544
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:53,883
Oh, it was all...
very stimulating.

545
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:55,861
l'm so happy for you.

546
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,557
l know you are.

547
00:30:57,597 --> 00:31:02,364
So, l guess this means
you'll be staying here a while.

548
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:08,735
l've enjoyed working
with you, Major.

549
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:13,610
l've enjoyed working
with you, too, Odo.

550
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:20,610
But, before we say good-bye,
l need your help one last time.

551
00:31:20,654 --> 00:31:21,678
Certainly.

552
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:24,121
Remember that power source
l was telling you about?

553
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:25,488
The one preventing you

554
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:27,516
from trying to contact
Commander Sisko.

555
00:31:27,561 --> 00:31:28,687
Well, l found it.

556
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:29,956
And what did it turn out to be?

557
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,088
l couldn't tell.

558
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:33,224
There was a door
blocking my path.

559
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,699
l need you to help me open it.

560
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:36,793
What kind of door?

561
00:31:36,836 --> 00:31:38,360
lt was composed
of some kind metal

562
00:31:38,405 --> 00:31:40,134
that the tricorder
couldn't identify.

563
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:42,164
Other than that, it,
it's an ordinary door.

564
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,300
That's odd.

565
00:31:43,343 --> 00:31:45,470
My people have
no need for doors.

566
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:47,742
They dislike taking
humanoid form.

567
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,271
l know.

568
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:51,682
Then who could be using it?

569
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:57,884
Ah, Commander.

570
00:31:57,924 --> 00:32:01,155
l was hoping to see
you before you left.

571
00:32:01,194 --> 00:32:05,153
l just wanted to tell you
how impressed l've been with you

572
00:32:05,198 --> 00:32:07,029
during these past two years.

573
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,261
You've run this station

574
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,702
with strength, dignity
and compassion.

575
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:13,205
Well done.

576
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,174
Thank you, Mr. Garak.

577
00:32:18,211 --> 00:32:21,442
But l'm sure you'll
be back before long.

578
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:26,418
Though from what l've heard,
it'll be to fight against Bajor.

579
00:32:26,453 --> 00:32:28,648
l've heard the same rumors.

580
00:32:28,688 --> 00:32:31,555
That Bajor has forged
a pact with the Romulans

581
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:34,287
to stand against
the Jem'Hadar...

582
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,227
and their allies.

583
00:32:36,262 --> 00:32:38,958
Oh, the Bajorans have fought
for their freedom before.

584
00:32:39,065 --> 00:32:43,195
lt only makes sense that
they'd fight for it again.

585
00:32:43,236 --> 00:32:44,863
So much for my peace mission.

586
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:47,702
Do l detect a note
of bitterness in your voice?

587
00:32:47,741 --> 00:32:49,675
l wouldn't be surprised.

588
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:52,507
lf it means anything to you,
Commander

589
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:56,982
l happen to share your feelings
about this Dominion treaty.

590
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,508
l've thought about it
a great deal

591
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:02,146
and the only explanation
l can find

592
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,521
is that our leaders
have simply gone insane.

593
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,517
lt seems that way.

594
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:13,055
Unfortunately, there's nothing
you or l can do about it.

595
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:14,225
l suppose not.

596
00:33:14,267 --> 00:33:15,757
After all, you have

597
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:18,270
your orders, and as for me,
well...

598
00:33:19,272 --> 00:33:20,534
l wouldn't dream

599
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:24,202
of opposing the wishes
of the Central Command.

600
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:26,508
Pity.

601
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,537
l agree...

602
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,143
that it's a pity.

603
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:35,518
l thought you would.

604
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,520
Mr. Garak, l never knew
we thought so much alike.

605
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:46,225
Life is full of surprises,
Commander.

606
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:47,494
Hmm.

607
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:50,460
Commander Sisko!

608
00:33:50,503 --> 00:33:53,063
Ah! There she is!

609
00:33:53,106 --> 00:33:54,630
No!

610
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:05,482
Can l help you?

611
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:07,645
We're here to see
Commander Sisko.

612
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:09,655
Sorry, my orders are
no one sees him.

613
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:11,247
But we're here
on urgent business.

614
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:13,054
Well, you'll have to talk
to Admiral Nechayev.

615
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,754
She's in charge here
until the Jem'Hadar...

616
00:34:14,794 --> 00:34:17,627
l'm afraid you have
a loose thread right here.

617
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:21,832
l'm sorry,
but we are pressed for time.

618
00:34:21,868 --> 00:34:23,859
l'll get Sisko.

619
00:34:23,903 --> 00:34:26,599
Doctor, if you'd be so kind
as to take his legs.

620
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,663
lf l didn't know better

621
00:34:27,707 --> 00:34:29,470
l'd say you were
enjoying yourself, Garak.

622
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:30,476
Oh, not at all, Doctor

623
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,307
but after years
of hemming women's dresses

624
00:34:32,345 --> 00:34:34,279
a little action is
a welcome change of pace.

625
00:34:36,382 --> 00:34:38,441
l hope you feel the same
way an hour from now.

626
00:34:38,485 --> 00:34:40,476
The first thing we need to do is
to get our hands on a runabout.

627
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,954
lt's already taken
care of, Benjamin.

628
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:45,958
The Chief's waiting for us
at Landing Pad C

629
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:47,754
with the <i>Rio Grande</i>

630
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,887
and a full compliment
of photon torpedoes.

631
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,829
How did you know we needed
photon torpedoes?

632
00:34:51,865 --> 00:34:52,957
l know you.

633
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:54,556
You want to make sure
the Dominion

634
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:56,068
stays on their side
of the galaxy

635
00:34:56,102 --> 00:34:57,330
and the only way to do that

636
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,463
is to collapse the entrance
to the wormhole.

637
00:34:59,506 --> 00:35:00,905
l'm glad we're all in agreement.

638
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,100
Well, l guess this means

639
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,734
the end
of our Starfleet careers.

640
00:35:03,777 --> 00:35:05,638
Oh, l wouldn't worry
about that, Doctor.

641
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,170
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

642
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,071
Oh, you misunderstand
me, Lieutenant.

643
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,598
All l meant was
it's a little foolish

644
00:35:10,643 --> 00:35:12,804
to worry about your careers
at a time like this

645
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:16,246
when there's a good chance
we're all about to be killed.

646
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,089
lnteresting.

647
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,319
Judging by this
locking mechanism

648
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,760
the purpose of this door
is not to keep people out

649
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:35,426
but rather to keep
whatever's on the other side in.

650
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:37,595
Do you think you
can get it open?

651
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,467
We'll see.

652
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,378
Halt!

653
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:50,814
Put down your weapons.

654
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,511
l have them, l have them.

655
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:55,213
By all means, Commander,
do as they say.

656
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:56,380
Garak.

657
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:57,889
Now you heard me, Doctor.

658
00:35:57,923 --> 00:36:00,289
Well, l'm glad to see
the plan is going as scheduled.

659
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,725
What plan is that?

660
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:04,628
You mean no one told you?

661
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:08,827
You see, l pretend
to be their friend

662
00:36:08,868 --> 00:36:10,563
and then l shoot you.

663
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:14,099
Well done, Garak.

664
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,574
Well, it's just something
l read once in a book.

665
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:17,906
l'm sure.

666
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:19,673
Garak!

667
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:21,009
Garak.

668
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:26,276
Doctor, l'm afraid
l won't be able

669
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:29,583
to have lunch
with you today.

670
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:32,113
We've got to go.
Come on.

671
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,041
Move it, Lieutenant.

672
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,238
l'm right behind you.

673
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,383
Get us out of here, Chief.

674
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:01,545
What about Garak?

675
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:02,713
He's not coming.

676
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:04,017
l see.

677
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,853
Hang on.

678
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:07,825
We'll reach the wormhole
in 30 seconds.

679
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,385
Prepare to launch
photon torpedoes.

680
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,828
We're being hailed.

681
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:13,491
lt's Admiral Nechayev.

682
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,796
Commander, l'm ordering you
to stand down.

683
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:17,860
Return to the station
immediately.

684
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,200
l'm afraid l'm going to have
to refuse that order.

685
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,399
Please, Commander

686
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,000
don't make us send
the Jem'Hadar after you.

687
00:37:24,043 --> 00:37:26,739
Go right ahead,
but you better warn them

688
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:30,408
not to expect any reinforcements
for about 70 years.

689
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,589
Attack pattern theta,
Mr. O'Brien. Hard a-port.

690
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,216
Yes, sir.

691
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:01,239
Step back, Major.

692
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:20,430
Please, come in.

693
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:24,563
Commander.

694
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:26,070
They can't hear you.

695
00:38:26,105 --> 00:38:27,834
What have you done to them?

696
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:28,840
Nothing harmful.

697
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:31,172
We're just conducting
a little experiment.

698
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,734
What kind of experiment?

699
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:35,542
To see how they'd respond
to an attempt by the Dominion

700
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:38,106
to gain a foothold
into the Alpha Quadrant.

701
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,310
We were curious to see

702
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,410
how much they'd be
willing to sacrifice

703
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,182
in order to avoid a war.

704
00:38:43,222 --> 00:38:44,621
And what have you found out?

705
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:45,646
Unfortunately...

706
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:49,853
...they're proving to be
just as stubborn as l'd feared.

707
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,192
l'm glad to hear it.

708
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,390
You are?

709
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:56,390
Well, that is a problem.

710
00:38:56,435 --> 00:39:00,599
But, thankfully,
it's not one l have to solve.

711
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,630
But l do.

712
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:05,938
l don't understand.

713
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:07,707
You knew about this?

714
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:09,441
Yes.

715
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,381
But how could you allow it?

716
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,749
You belong to the Dominion,
don't you?

717
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:15,117
Belong to it?

718
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:18,453
Major, the changelings
are the Dominion.

719
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,295
You're the Founders.

720
00:39:26,332 --> 00:39:27,799
lronic, isn't it?

721
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,528
The hunted now control

722
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:32,196
the destinies
of hundreds of other races.

723
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,727
But...

724
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:36,036
why control anyone?

725
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:39,272
Because what you can control
can't hurt you.

726
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:42,303
So, many years ago,
we set ourselves the task

727
00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:45,283
of imposing order
on a chaotic universe.

728
00:39:45,317 --> 00:39:47,581
ls that what you call it?
lmposing order?

729
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,109
l call it murder.

730
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:53,090
What you call it is
no concern of ours.

731
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:56,390
How do you justify
the deaths of so many people?

732
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:59,158
The solids have always
been a threat to us--

733
00:39:59,198 --> 00:40:00,790
that's the only
justification we need.

734
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:03,393
Well, these solids
have never harmed you.

735
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:07,030
They travel the galaxy in order
to expand their knowledge

736
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,437
just as you once did.

737
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:11,170
The solids are nothing like us.

738
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:17,149
No... l suppose they're not.

739
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:20,910
And neither am l.

740
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:24,684
l've devoted my life
to the pursuit of justice

741
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:28,284
but justice means nothing
to you, does it?

742
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:30,420
lt is not justice you desire,
Odo

743
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:32,362
but order, the same as we do.

744
00:40:32,398 --> 00:40:35,026
And we can help you
satisfy that desire

745
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:38,366
in ways the solids never could.

746
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:39,928
This will all
become clear to you

747
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,371
once you've taken your place
in the Great Link.

748
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:44,239
No.

749
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:48,940
l admit this...
Link of yours is appealing

750
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:53,145
but you see, l already
have a link...

751
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:55,619
with these people.

752
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:58,680
l want you to remove
those devices

753
00:40:58,724 --> 00:41:00,351
and bring them their combadges.

754
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:01,791
We can't allow them to leave.

755
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,295
And l can't allow you
to keep them here.

756
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:05,557
They're leaving.

757
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:08,657
And so am l.

758
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,830
lt's taken you many years
to find your way back home.

759
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:16,739
Are you really willing
to leave it again so soon?

760
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,766
Unless you intend to stop me.

761
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:21,575
No changeling has
ever harmed another.

762
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:23,478
Whatever you do to them

763
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:25,915
you're going
to have to do to me.

764
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,287
They are free to go.

765
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,118
Thank you.

766
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:37,584
The next time, l promise you,
we will not be so generous.

767
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:48,600
Major... Constable.

768
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,403
What happened to the <i>Rio Grande?</i>

769
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:52,603
The last thing l remember
is collapsing the wormhole.

770
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,509
The last thing l remember
is being shot

771
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:55,672
by some Jem'Hadar soldier.

772
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,181
l'm sure it all
seemed very real

773
00:41:57,216 --> 00:41:58,843
but the truth is you've
been held in this room

774
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:01,341
since the Jem'Hadar brought
you here from the <i>Defiant.</i>

775
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:03,704
Borath, what the hell
is going on here?

776
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:05,108
Your ship is in orbit.

777
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:07,340
You may transport back to it
whenever you're ready.

778
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,008
Commander,
l'll be along shortly.

779
00:42:11,785 --> 00:42:13,480
l'll stay down here
and make sure

780
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,044
that he gets back
to the ship.

781
00:42:15,088 --> 00:42:16,419
Another shape-shifter.

782
00:42:16,456 --> 00:42:17,753
Commander, you must leave now.

783
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:20,055
l give you my word
l'll explain everything later.

784
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:23,760
l'll look forward to it.

785
00:42:25,098 --> 00:42:26,861
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

786
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:28,833
Five to beam up.

787
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:35,864
l hope that one day
you'll return to us, Odo

788
00:42:35,942 --> 00:42:39,400
and take your rightful place
within the Dominion.

789
00:42:39,446 --> 00:42:41,539
l don't think that's possible.

790
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:45,347
Your link to the solids
won't last.

791
00:42:45,385 --> 00:42:48,684
You will always be an outsider.

792
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:51,246
Being an outsider isn't so bad.

793
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:54,260
lt gives one
a unique perspective.

794
00:42:54,294 --> 00:42:57,286
lt's a pity
you've forgotten that.

795
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,356
Then perhaps one day,
l'll come visit you.

796
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,336
The Alpha Quadrant seems
wracked with chaos.

797
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,634
lt could use some order.

798
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:10,700
lmposing your type of order
on the Alpha Quadrant

799
00:43:10,743 --> 00:43:14,235
may prove more difficult
than you imagine.

800
00:43:15,482 --> 00:43:19,248
We are willing to wait
until the time is right.

801
00:43:25,758 --> 00:43:28,591
We will miss you, Odo

802
00:43:28,628 --> 00:43:32,689
but you will miss us even more.

803
00:43:56,055 --> 00:43:57,545
Odo?

804
00:44:00,894 --> 00:44:03,385
Ready, Major.

805
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:17,740
Kira to <i>Defiant.</i>

806
00:44:19,412 --> 00:44:21,403
Two to beam up.
