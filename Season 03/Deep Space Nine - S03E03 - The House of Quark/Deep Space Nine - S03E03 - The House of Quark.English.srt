1
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,000
Now, l know we're doomed.

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,439
Why, brother?

3
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,842
Rule of Acquisition 286:

4
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:22,870
''When Morn leaves,
it's all over.''

5
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:26,009
There is no such rule.

6
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:27,348
There should be.

7
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:29,854
Oh, l know business is bad,
but that's no reason...

8
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:31,321
Bad? Bad?

9
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:33,347
lt's 2100 hours.

10
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:35,121
The bar's open.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,855
There's a sale on synthehol

12
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:38,760
and there's no one here.

13
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:41,197
You, Ferengi!

14
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:43,393
Another bloodwine now!

15
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:45,995
At least someone is still here.

16
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:47,369
How many has he had?

17
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:48,395
A dozen.

18
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:52,209
l should have gone
into insurance...

19
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:55,041
better hours, more money,
less scruples.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,048
lt's all Sisko's fault.

21
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:58,572
Sisko?

22
00:00:58,617 --> 00:00:59,914
That's right.

23
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:02,044
lf he'd handled things better
with the Dominion

24
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:03,349
none of this
would have happened.

25
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:05,686
They want a foothold
in the Alpha Quadrant.

26
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:08,693
Cut a deal.
Make a few arrangements.

27
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:10,627
Give them a little something
for their trouble.

28
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:11,651
Brother?

29
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,961
But no!
He had to play it tough.

30
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:16,126
So now everyone's afraid
of the Dominion.

31
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:17,135
Yes, but, brother?

32
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:19,501
And that means
fewer people on the station

33
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,403
which means
fewer people at Quark's

34
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,500
which means
l am out of business.

35
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:30,106
Where's my wine, you cowering
little Ferengi slug?

36
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:31,342
What's the problem?

37
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,078
He says he's out of money.

38
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:34,346
He's asking for credit.

39
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,353
Credit?

40
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,912
l'll handle it.

41
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:40,447
Watch and learn.

42
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:49,557
My name is Quark.

43
00:01:54,973 --> 00:01:59,740
l'm... like to discuss, uh,
arranging a line of credit.

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,516
You dare talk to me like that?

45
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,383
You pathetic <i>mak'dar.</i>

46
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:49,914
How long are they going
to leave him there?

47
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,857
l wish they would hurry up
and get rid of him.

48
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,122
l wish we could
put him on display.

49
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,719
What?

50
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:58,059
Look at them.

51
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,533
They're consumed
with morbid fascination.

52
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,693
They can't wait to get in here.

53
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,032
They all want to know
what happened.

54
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,867
Was it a bar fight?

55
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,532
What started it?

56
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:11,270
And most of all,
who killed the Klingon?

57
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,335
But no one killed him.
lt was an accident.

58
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,903
l killed him in a bar fight.

59
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:15,914
Wha...?

60
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:16,915
You heard me.

61
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,610
l killed him in self-defense.

62
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,640
But where is the profit

63
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,209
in lying
about a simple drunken...?

64
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,017
Look at that crowd.

65
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,488
How long has it been
since you've seen

66
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,218
that many customers
waiting to get in here?

67
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,727
This is an opportunity
to turn everything around.

68
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,093
This is insane, brother.

69
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,621
What if his family comes
looking for the killer?

70
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,429
What if they want revenge?

71
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,197
lf push comes to shove

72
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,500
we tell the truth
and no harm done.

73
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:41,972
Rom, let me put it another way.

74
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,638
lf business doesn't improve,
l'll have to start making

75
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,342
a few cutbacks
in the operation of my bar

76
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,113
beginning with... your salary.

77
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,279
How big of a cutback?

78
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:59,213
l'd probably have
to cut it back to zero.

79
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,249
All right, Quark.

80
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,420
Start at the beginning.

81
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,826
My brother fought a desperate

82
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,626
hand-to-hand battle
with the Klingon

83
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,633
and was forced to kill
in self-defense.

84
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:12,059
You killed him?

85
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,263
l'm sorry.

86
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,933
l couldn't avoid it.

87
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,037
He was abusive...

88
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,308
vulgar.

89
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,747
A typical drunken Klingon.

90
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,250
All that was fine

91
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,718
until it came time
to pay his bill.

92
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:29,618
He refused.
l insisted.

93
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,088
We began to argue.

94
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,624
He pushed me.

95
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:34,893
l pushed back.

96
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,360
l was about
to call for security

97
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,987
to throw him out of my bar

98
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,759
when suddenly,
he pulls a knife on me!

99
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,699
l avoided the first thrust.

100
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,897
He came at me again.

101
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,872
l hit him with a left jab.

102
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,738
There was
a furious exchange of blows.

103
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,106
The next thing l knew

104
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,975
his knife was at my throat.

105
00:06:55,414 --> 00:07:01,011
So, l twisted it
out of his grasp

106
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,250
and plunged it into his chest.

107
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,030
l will never forget
the look on his face

108
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,398
when his life drained away.

109
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,893
l'd rather not talk
about this anymore.

110
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,516
Hi, honey.

111
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,279
Hi.

112
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,310
Oh, what a day.

113
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,652
Synthale, tall glass.

114
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,926
We had three Coverian
freighter captains

115
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,529
all wanting to use
the same docking port.

116
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,096
Someone stole a case
of medical supplies

117
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,608
from the lnfirmary.

118
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,132
Two power failures.

119
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,514
How was school?

120
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,519
l closed it.

121
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,578
You closed the school?

122
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,919
Well, why?

123
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:12,253
What happened?

124
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,522
My last two Bajoran
students left today.

125
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,724
Their families
relocated back to Bajor.

126
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:22,530
That left Jake, Nog
and a lot of empty chairs.

127
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,002
Well, what about Jake and Nog?

128
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,698
Won't they have to...?

129
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,970
l told them l'd be happy
to tutor them from now on.

130
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,137
Two students are not
enough to sustain a school.

131
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,446
l'm really sorry, Keiko.

132
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,956
lt's not your fault.

133
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,788
Everyone's just afraid
of the Dominion.

134
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,058
People aren't going to be
moving their families

135
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,961
to the station anymore.

136
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:54,898
That means no more children

137
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,902
which means no more school.

138
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,961
Don't look so upset.

139
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,801
lt's not like l was planning

140
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,467
to be a teacher
for the rest of my life.

141
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,475
Keiko.

142
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,170
l'm fine, really.

143
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,672
Don't worry, Constable.

144
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:37,233
l won't be dispatching
any more customers today.

145
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,904
You don't have
to keep an eye on me.

146
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,970
Oh, thank you for putting
my mind at ease

147
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,244
but l didn't come here
to protect the patrons

148
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,910
from your violent temper.

149
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:47,612
Then what can l do for you?

150
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,451
l just thought you'd
like to know who it was

151
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,684
that you killed in self-defense.

152
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,192
Sure.

153
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,059
His name was Kozak,
by all accounts

154
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,563
a thoroughly
disreputable character.

155
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,224
A notorious drunkard.

156
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,359
Well, sounds like someone
who was going

157
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,925
to get himself killed
sooner or later.

158
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:05,436
lt's a shame it had
to happen here.

159
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,234
Hmm, isn't it?

160
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,468
l thought you'd also
like to know

161
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,636
that Kozak wasn't just
some drifter passing through.

162
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,442
ln fact, he was the head
of a Klingon family

163
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:19,383
a rather powerful family,
from what l can gather.

164
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:23,946
Now, do you want
to change your story

165
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,549
or do you want to wait
for Kozak's family

166
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,116
to show up and ask to see

167
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,559
the Ferengi bartender
who killed him?

168
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,861
l told you what happened,
Constable.

169
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,299
Now, either order something

170
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,566
or make room
for a paying customer.

171
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:48,642
Brother, didn't you hear
what he said?

172
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,875
l heard him.

173
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,109
Then we have
to tell the truth.

174
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,981
We've made enough profit
in the last few hours

175
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:54,542
to make up
for the losses we had...

176
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,055
lt's not about profit anymore.

177
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,649
lt's about respect.

178
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,489
lt is?

179
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,844
You see the way
they look at me now.

180
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:06,741
l'm not just some venal Ferengi
trying to take their money.

181
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,547
l'm Quark, slayer
of Klingons.

182
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:14,418
l've struck a blow
for Ferengi everywhere.

183
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,445
But what about Kozak's family?

184
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,685
What if they come here
for revenge?

185
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,022
lf that happens

186
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,520
l'll stand up, look them
straight in the eye

187
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:26,589
and offer them a bribe.

188
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:42,479
You killed my brother.

189
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:52,349
My brother killed
by a miserable Ferengi.

190
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:54,257
l never would have
believed it possible.

191
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:55,989
l can explain.

192
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,690
You'd better!

193
00:11:57,731 --> 00:12:00,859
l want to know
exactly how Kozak died

194
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:03,768
and if l don't like
what l hear...

195
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:06,034
Believe me, you'll like it.

196
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:07,767
He was in my bar.

197
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:09,833
l asked him to pay his tab.

198
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:11,400
He refused.

199
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:13,936
l was willing
to let it go at that

200
00:12:13,981 --> 00:12:16,950
but then, he pulled a knife
and came at me

201
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:19,179
and the truth
of the matter is

202
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:22,347
he was so inebriated
that he just fell...

203
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:24,983
l hope you're not
going to tell me

204
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:26,458
that he died in an accident.

205
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:28,290
You do?

206
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:31,627
Yes! Because there would be
no honor in such a death.

207
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:33,599
And if Kozak died in disgrace

208
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,397
then that disgrace
would be passed along

209
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:38,165
to the rest of his family.

210
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:40,867
So if you were
the cause of an accident

211
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,307
that will dishonor
my entire family

212
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:45,004
then l'm going to kill you

213
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:48,742
and stuff your miserable corpse
out the nearest airlock.

214
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:49,749
l see.

215
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:51,512
On the other hand

216
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:58,184
if he died as a warrior
in personal combat

217
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:01,126
then there would be no dishonor
for him or his family.

218
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:03,994
So what you're saying is

219
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:10,527
if l killed him
in personal combat, that's good.

220
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,832
Of course it isn't good!

221
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:14,033
He was my brother...

222
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:16,041
but...

223
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:18,043
it would be honorable

224
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:23,242
and an honorable death
requires no vengeance.

225
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:25,251
Your life would be spared.

226
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:27,276
l wish you had been there.

227
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,585
You would have been proud
of your brother.

228
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:33,252
He fought a brave
and valiant battle

229
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:35,056
right up to the end.

230
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:37,290
lt was an honor to kill him.

231
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,060
l'm sure it was.

232
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:45,002
Remember that
when you tell your customers

233
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:47,973
about the death of Kozak.

234
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:49,873
You can count on it.

235
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:54,514
<i>Qapla'!</i>

236
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:12,191
What's going on?

237
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:14,166
You're five minutes early.

238
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,362
The canapés aren't ready yet.

239
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:18,200
Have l missed something?

240
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:22,038
Now, don't tell me
you've forgotten what day it is.

241
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:24,168
Well, it, it's not
our anniversary

242
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:26,907
or my birthday or...

243
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:28,608
l can't believe
you've forgotten.

244
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:30,775
lt's ''l'm married
to the most wonderful woman

245
00:14:30,817 --> 00:14:32,307
in the galaxy'' day.

246
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:34,217
l marked it in your calendar.

247
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:37,280
l don't think l'm too familiar
with that day.

248
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:39,451
Oh, it's an old lrish tradition.

249
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:41,791
Here we go.

250
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:43,956
Ooh!

251
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:46,056
l thought l should
start celebrating it.

252
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,930
Too bad it only
comes once a year.

253
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:50,198
Well, actually, it's
a very irregular holiday--

254
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:52,068
crops up all over the place...

255
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,039
sometimes twice a day.

256
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:55,871
Really?

257
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:58,878
What's a traditional
celebration?

258
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:00,402
Cake?

259
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:01,573
Mm-mm.

260
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:02,673
Noisemakers?

261
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:03,876
Mm-mm.

262
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:04,906
Fireworks?

263
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:07,442
Oh, definitely fireworks.

264
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:22,025
l should be finished
the docking inspection

265
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:23,501
by 1300 hours.

266
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:25,664
How about lunch
in the Replimat?

267
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:27,002
Sounds good to me.

268
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,337
lt's a date then.

269
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,672
See you later.

270
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,006
Hey...

271
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:34,275
just wanted to thank you
for last night.

272
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:35,941
lt was wonderful.

273
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:38,416
You've already thanked me.

274
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:44,256
Have a good day.

275
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,419
l'll be in Upper Pylon 2
if you need me.

276
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,291
l'll be here.

277
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:10,712
Who's there?

278
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,150
We're closed.

279
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:15,484
Are you Quark?

280
00:16:15,522 --> 00:16:18,616
That depends on who's asking.

281
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:24,728
My name is Grilka.

282
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:27,130
Kozak was my husband.

283
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:31,160
Oh, uh... well, come in.

284
00:16:31,204 --> 00:16:32,671
Can l get you a drink
or something to eat?

285
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:34,003
l've been told

286
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,770
that you are the one
who killed my husband.

287
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,472
l didn't want to.

288
00:16:39,512 --> 00:16:42,037
l had no choice.

289
00:16:42,082 --> 00:16:44,482
Was it an honorable death?

290
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:46,417
Absolutely.

291
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:50,514
He died like a warrior.

292
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:53,355
l'm very sorry this happened.

293
00:16:53,393 --> 00:16:56,260
ls there something l can do?

294
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:58,230
Actually, there is.

295
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:01,530
Defend yourself!

296
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:16,105
So this is the man who killed
my husband in personal combat.

297
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:17,275
What's this all about?
Who are you?

298
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:18,375
l already told you.

299
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:23,014
l'm Kozak's widow,
but first things first, Quark.

300
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:26,422
l want to know
how my husband died

301
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,552
and l want the truth.

302
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:30,290
All right.

303
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:45,143
He was drunk and he did try
to attack me

304
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:48,511
but he tripped and fell
on his own knife.

305
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:53,212
So you lied to the station
security officer

306
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:56,654
to your customers,
and to D'Ghor.

307
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,885
You must be quite a liar.

308
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:00,552
lt's a gift.

309
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:05,229
l think it's time you put
that gift to work... for me.

310
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:10,023
<i>Cho'echu!</i>

311
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:23,103
What...

312
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:26,749
What happened?

313
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:28,376
Where am l?

314
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:32,519
You are on Kronos.

315
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:33,887
Kronos...

316
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:35,585
the Klingon Homeworld.

317
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:38,390
You are in the ancestral home

318
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:42,763
of what used to be known
as the House of Kozak.

319
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,734
What's it called now?

320
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:50,832
Kozak died without a male heir.

321
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:54,469
The House no longer has a name.

322
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:56,308
What about Kozak's brother,
D'Ghor?

323
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:59,805
<i>Juht!</i> That <i>pahtk's</i> name
is not spoken in this house.

324
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,875
He is no brother to Kozak.

325
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,480
His family has been
a sworn enemy to this House

326
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:07,217
for seven generations.

327
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:08,952
But he came to DS9.

328
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:10,289
He told me...

329
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:12,522
What he told you were lies.

330
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:16,090
He wanted you to say that Kozak
had died in honorable combat

331
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:19,933
so that no special dispensation
would be granted.

332
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,835
l don't understand.

333
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:26,832
lf Kozak had died in an accident
and left no male heir

334
00:19:26,877 --> 00:19:28,936
the Council might have decided

335
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:31,971
that this was
an unusual situation

336
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:34,984
and granted
special dispensation.

337
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:37,509
That might have allowed
Grilka to become

338
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:39,749
head of the family,
even though she's a woman

339
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,487
but if Kozak died
in an honorable fight

340
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:47,327
was defeated simply
by a better opponent

341
00:19:47,364 --> 00:19:51,630
then no dispensation
would have been granted

342
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:55,604
and without a male heir,
the House will fall.

343
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:59,040
That hasn't happened yet, Tumek,
and there is still time

344
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:01,338
to prevent it
from ever happening.

345
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:02,504
Put this on.

346
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:03,843
Why?

347
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:06,509
Because if you do not,
l will kill you.

348
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,177
l beg you.

349
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:09,947
Consider what you do here,
mistress.

350
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:11,386
The decision is made.

351
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:13,151
There is no other choice.

352
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:20,223
<i>Go'Eveh, lu cha wabeh,</i>
<i>Mo ka re'Chos.</i>

353
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:24,200
Repeat my words.

354
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:26,702
<i>Go'Eveh, lu cha wabeh,</i>
<i>To va re'Luk.</i>

355
00:20:26,737 --> 00:20:29,535
Let me ask just one...

356
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:31,768
Repeat the words.

357
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:37,748
<i>Go'Eveh, lu cha wabeh,</i>
<i>To va re'Luk.</i>

358
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:39,908
<i>GhoS ma'lu Kah.</i>

359
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:50,251
lt is done.

360
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:51,784
What's done?

361
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:53,922
The ceremony is complete.

362
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:56,091
You are husband and wife.

363
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:12,840
And while you're at it

364
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:14,714
have Alpha shift begin
a series of battle drills.

365
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:17,049
l'm not satisfied with their
last performance evaluations.

366
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,054
Right.

367
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:20,521
Oh, ah, excuse me, sir.

368
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:22,184
l can come back later.

369
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:24,057
No, no, no.
We're done here.

370
00:21:24,094 --> 00:21:25,527
What can l do for you?

371
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:27,189
Well, it's...

372
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:28,858
it's kind of private.

373
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:30,264
Wife problems, Chief?

374
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,892
How did you know?

375
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:34,495
Well, l've been a husband
and l've been a wife

376
00:21:34,538 --> 00:21:36,904
and l know that look
from both sides.

377
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,407
Come on.

378
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:40,034
What?

379
00:21:40,077 --> 00:21:42,671
This is where we make
a graceful exit

380
00:21:42,713 --> 00:21:45,273
and let the boys talk
amongst themselves.

381
00:21:45,315 --> 00:21:47,374
Must be some kind
of human thing.

382
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:49,317
Well, l'm sure the old man

383
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:51,480
will be happy
to explain it to you

384
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:52,989
on your way out.

385
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,230
Chief.

386
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:16,642
l guess, uh, Keiko
must be very upset

387
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,614
about the school closing, huh?

388
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:20,776
Well, that's just it, sir.

389
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,978
She's acting
like she doesn't care

390
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,715
like there's nothing wrong.

391
00:22:24,755 --> 00:22:26,882
That sounds bad.

392
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:28,983
l've tried to lift
her spirits a bit--

393
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:30,254
romantic dinners

394
00:22:30,294 --> 00:22:32,489
long moonlit walks
in the holosuite.

395
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:34,588
l even rearranged
my work schedule

396
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:36,826
so l could spend
more time with her.

397
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,028
Nothing seems
to make a difference.

398
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:40,832
But now you have an idea?

399
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,771
Oh, yes, sir.

400
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:46,367
Um, l, l'd like permission
to convert

401
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,004
one of the empty cargo
bays into an arboretum.

402
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:51,276
l think Bay 21 would be ideal.

403
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:53,306
The ODN conduits are shot

404
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,877
and the security system's
never worked anyway.

405
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,320
So you're saying yes?

406
00:22:59,356 --> 00:23:00,983
Ah, sounds like it to me.

407
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:06,788
Listen...

408
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,025
there's nothing
harder than knowing

409
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:11,364
that the person you love
is unhappy.

410
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:14,893
And l know how important it is
to do something about it.

411
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:17,771
lf one empty cargo bay
makes Keiko happy

412
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:19,969
then l'm all for it.

413
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,274
l just hope it works.

414
00:23:22,312 --> 00:23:24,906
So do l.

415
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:28,679
She sacrificed her entire career
to be here with me.

416
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:30,550
l owe her.

417
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:36,719
lf there's anything else
l can do, just let me know.

418
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:40,886
Thank you, sir.

419
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:54,543
There being no special
circumstances in the death

420
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:56,205
and no male heir

421
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,873
l make claim

422
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:01,714
to the title and property
of this fallen House.

423
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:04,186
The Council has considered
your petition

424
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:06,018
and will grant the transfer

425
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:08,286
once the final rituals
have been...

426
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:10,316
The petition is out of order.

427
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,123
This woman has no place here.

428
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:14,960
Her husband is dead
and her House is fallen.

429
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:16,898
l ask that she be taken
from the hall...

430
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:19,697
l have performed
the <i>brek'tal</i> ritual, Gowron

431
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:24,696
and have chosen
a new husband to lead my House.

432
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:27,904
Enter, husband!

433
00:24:32,082 --> 00:24:35,176
A Ferengi cannot be allowed
to rule a Klingon House!

434
00:24:35,218 --> 00:24:38,779
All l have done is follow
the <i>brek'tal</i> ritual.

435
00:24:38,822 --> 00:24:43,054
lf the leader of a House
is slain in honorable combat

436
00:24:43,093 --> 00:24:46,961
the victor may be invited
to take his place

437
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,794
and his wife.

438
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:51,892
You are the one that made
this possible, D'Ghor.

439
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:54,699
You certified before the Council

440
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:57,764
that Kozak died
an honorable death

441
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:00,072
at the hands of this man.

442
00:25:00,143 --> 00:25:04,973
l am simply exercising
my rights as an honored widow.

443
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:09,736
l will have your House
and your title, Grilka

444
00:25:09,778 --> 00:25:14,215
and when l am done,
l will place your head

445
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:18,379
and the head
of this ridiculous Ferengi

446
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,445
outside the gates.

447
00:25:20,488 --> 00:25:22,422
Uh, can l say something?

448
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:24,982
lt seems there's
some kind of dispute

449
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,359
going on over some land,
maybe some other property...

450
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:30,387
l think maybe we should
consider a deal.

451
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:32,161
l should kill you right now.

452
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,098
<i>mev yap!</i>

453
00:25:35,937 --> 00:25:39,168
D'Ghor, you cannot challenge
this man in Council

454
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:40,765
without just cause.

455
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:44,142
We will have to consider
this matter carefully

456
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,670
before a final decision
is reached.

457
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:49,877
Until then,
the <i>brek'tal</i> will be respected.

458
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:54,754
The House of Kozak is gone.

459
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:59,158
For the time being, it will be
known as... as the House of...

460
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,263
Quark.

461
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:05,163
Quirk.

462
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,599
Quark!

463
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,995
The House of Quark.

464
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:26,616
l told you not to say anything.

465
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:31,455
l was trying to avoid a lot
of unnecessary bloodshed...

466
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:33,927
like my own.

467
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:37,159
Just do as l say and there
won't be any bloodshed.

468
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:38,324
Fine.

469
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:40,231
What's next?

470
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:49,506
What do we do now?

471
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:51,512
How do we strengthen
the position of your House?

472
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:53,741
How do we keep D'Ghor
from carrying out his threats?

473
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:54,748
What's the plan?

474
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:55,749
l'm thinking.

475
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:56,977
You don't have a plan, do you?

476
00:26:57,018 --> 00:26:58,849
You're just making
this up as you go along.

477
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:00,787
l've managed to get us this far.

478
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:04,519
But you have no idea
where to go from here.

479
00:27:08,997 --> 00:27:11,830
Can l make a suggestion?

480
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:16,633
Let's try having a more
equal partnership, shall we?

481
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:21,434
What do you want?

482
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:25,640
Just tell me what's going on.

483
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:35,486
Kozak squandered much
of our family's wealth

484
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:38,321
incurred several
large gambling debts

485
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,224
made unwise investments.

486
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:43,958
As a result, the House has
been weakened severely

487
00:27:43,998 --> 00:27:46,364
in power and in influence.

488
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:49,165
Much of the debt
is owed to D'Ghor

489
00:27:49,204 --> 00:27:52,298
who is now ready to take
advantage of our weakness.

490
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,832
lf he can gain title
of our lands and property

491
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,469
his family will become

492
00:27:57,512 --> 00:28:00,003
a very powerful influence
in the Empire.

493
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:02,744
He may even earn
a seat on the Council.

494
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:04,411
Would it be possible for me

495
00:28:04,452 --> 00:28:07,216
to see all the financial
records of your House

496
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:08,882
and l mean all of them?

497
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:11,084
D'Ghor's, too,
if you can arrange it.

498
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,650
Maybe l can find a way
out of this mess.

499
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:16,289
That is not
how we do things here.

500
00:28:16,331 --> 00:28:17,855
We are Klingons.

501
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:20,561
We do not dirty ourselves
with filthy ledgers

502
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:22,695
looking
for some financial trick.

503
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:25,103
Look, we've been doing
things your way

504
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:28,666
ever since this started
and now you've run out of ideas.

505
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,406
So maybe we should try doing
things my way for a change.

506
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,404
lt certainly can't hurt

507
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:37,179
to let me look
at some ''filthy ledgers.''

508
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,558
Good afternoon, Chief.

509
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:55,501
Doctor.

510
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:57,094
<i>Plomeek</i> soup, hot.

511
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,901
Oh, with a touch of basil.

512
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:11,412
What do you think?

513
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:16,486
You're asking my opinion?

514
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:21,157
An arboretum.
For Keiko, l presume

515
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:22,822
to make her a little happier

516
00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:24,855
now the school's
been closed down.

517
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,129
lt's not just for Keiko.

518
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:30,501
l mean, it'd benefit
the entire station.

519
00:29:32,273 --> 00:29:33,570
Do you think it'll work?

520
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:35,235
Absolutely...

521
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:36,470
for about two months.

522
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:39,105
Then you'll be right back
where you started.

523
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:42,240
Two months?

524
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:43,716
Well, it's been my experience

525
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:45,275
that during any
serious disagreement

526
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,312
a smile and sweet words
will buy you two hours

527
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:51,553
flowers will buy you a week

528
00:29:51,592 --> 00:29:54,356
an arboretum, well,
that's at least two months.

529
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:55,885
But, in the end

530
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,091
you still have to solve
the underlying problem.

531
00:29:58,132 --> 00:29:59,463
l thought an arboretum

532
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,401
would give her a chance
to continue her studies.

533
00:30:02,437 --> 00:30:04,928
Help her find something
to do with her time.

534
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:05,996
Like a hobby?

535
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:07,005
Exactly.

536
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:09,736
Exactly why it won't work.

537
00:30:09,777 --> 00:30:13,235
You can't ask her to turn
her profession into a hobby.

538
00:30:13,281 --> 00:30:16,876
Would you be satisfied just
pottering around in a workshop

539
00:30:16,918 --> 00:30:18,977
building nano-circuit boards
and playing with tricorders?

540
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,181
l suppose not.

541
00:30:21,222 --> 00:30:23,019
You're Chief of Operations

542
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:25,457
l'm a doctor,
and Keiko's a botanist

543
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:28,018
and until she can be
a botanist again

544
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:31,532
l'm not sure she's ever
really going to be happy.

545
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,004
Very clever.

546
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,872
Very clever, indeed.

547
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:45,276
D'Ghor has manipulated
your family's holdings

548
00:30:45,313 --> 00:30:47,907
devalued the lands you hold

549
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:49,780
and he is
the principal creditor

550
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:52,547
on Kozak's outstanding
gambling debts.

551
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:55,681
lt's no accident
your family's getting weaker

552
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:58,055
and D'Ghor's family
is getting stronger.

553
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:00,788
He's been systematically
attacking your family's assets

554
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:02,819
for over five years now.

555
00:31:02,864 --> 00:31:05,492
You mean D'Ghor
has been scheming

556
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:07,694
and plotting like a F...

557
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:09,999
Like a Ferengi.

558
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:13,973
There is no honor
in what he has done.

559
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:16,238
lf he wanted
to challenge my House

560
00:31:16,277 --> 00:31:17,744
he should have made
a declaration

561
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:19,371
met our forces in battle.

562
00:31:19,414 --> 00:31:23,214
And risk destroying
the very thing he wanted most--

563
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:24,843
your lands and property?

564
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:31,688
Can you prove any of this?

565
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:35,025
You can show the Council
exactly what D'Ghor has done?

566
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:36,029
lt's all right there.

567
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:37,997
All l have to do
is talk them through it.

568
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:43,297
Thank you, Quark.

569
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:45,396
You may have saved my family.

570
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,774
Well, it is the House
of Quark, after all.

571
00:31:56,918 --> 00:32:02,686
l really am very grateful
for all you've done, Quark.

572
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:08,684
That is why l'm going to let
you take your hand off my thigh

573
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:13,347
instead of shattering
every bone in your body.

574
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:21,153
Let's go talk to the Council.

575
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:26,385
So, as you can see
from the gross adjusted

576
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:29,487
assets tabulation in Column ''J''

577
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,432
the net value
of the land acquisition

578
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:34,934
was actually zero.

579
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:36,526
Now, if you go to the file

580
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,867
marked ''devaluation
of capital income''

581
00:32:37,905 --> 00:32:38,963
we can review the way D'Ghor...

582
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,700
Enough.

583
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:45,503
l don't want to hear
anything more

584
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:49,676
about finances, mergers
or currency transactions.

585
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:57,448
The charge has been made
that you have used money

586
00:32:57,491 --> 00:32:59,584
to bring down a great House.

587
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:01,150
What do you say to this, D'Ghor?

588
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:03,823
l say that he is a liar.

589
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:08,699
That he has smeared my name
and l demand vengeance

590
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:10,828
through personal combat.

591
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:15,641
l have discovered new evidence

592
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:20,670
evidence which proves
Kozak did not die honorably.

593
00:33:20,714 --> 00:33:24,377
That he actually died
in an accident.

594
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:27,353
l have a witness who will say

595
00:33:27,387 --> 00:33:32,086
he watched Kozak trip
and fall on his own blade

596
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:35,617
and that Quark made up
the entire story.

597
00:33:35,662 --> 00:33:38,062
l don't know what
he's trying to pull here.

598
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:41,124
The only other person
who was there was...

599
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:47,336
Hello, brother.

600
00:33:55,415 --> 00:33:56,882
Come on, this way.

601
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:58,407
And keep quiet!

602
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:05,859
l thought
you might try to leave.

603
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:08,919
Look, l have done my part
in this little game of yours

604
00:34:08,962 --> 00:34:11,522
and l am sorry
about your House and title

605
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:15,228
but there's a man out there
that wants to kill me tomorrow.

606
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:17,396
lt's a matter of honor, Quark.

607
00:34:17,437 --> 00:34:19,701
D'Ghor has accused you of lying.

608
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,436
There's no way
to answer that challenge

609
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:24,706
except through personal combat.

610
00:34:24,745 --> 00:34:26,804
To you Klingons
there may be no other way

611
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:28,474
but there's
an old Ferengi saying

612
00:34:28,515 --> 00:34:30,949
about discretion being
the better part of valor.

613
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:34,681
Then what they say
about the Ferengi is true.

614
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:37,451
You're all lying,
thieving cowards

615
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:40,585
who have no sense
of loyalty or honor.

616
00:34:40,627 --> 00:34:42,356
Sticks and stones.

617
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:45,422
l thought you were different.

618
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:49,629
l thought you had
something in here.

619
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:54,232
But all you have in there
is a piece of latinum.

620
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:57,937
And it's a pretty small piece
at that.

621
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,078
Let them run.

622
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:04,811
l don't want them in my House.

623
00:35:15,495 --> 00:35:18,589
All right, let's go.

624
00:35:18,632 --> 00:35:20,600
What?

625
00:35:20,634 --> 00:35:23,364
What?!

626
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:26,804
You think l should stay
and fight D'Ghor?

627
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,035
ls that what you're thinking?

628
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:31,135
How could you let her
get to you like this?

629
00:35:31,178 --> 00:35:32,543
Don't you see
what she's trying to do?

630
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:33,944
She's trying to make us
feel guilty.

631
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:35,140
Well, it's not going to work.

632
00:35:35,182 --> 00:35:36,149
You're right, brother.

633
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:37,241
You're a businessman.

634
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:38,808
All you care about is profit.

635
00:35:38,852 --> 00:35:39,944
Right.

636
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:42,285
This was all just a ploy
to boost sales at the bar.

637
00:35:42,322 --> 00:35:45,553
Who cares if some Klingon
female loses her House?

638
00:35:45,592 --> 00:35:46,616
l certainly don't.

639
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,649
Me neither.

640
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:49,959
Well...

641
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,261
Now, let's get out of here.

642
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:07,769
Grilka

643
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:10,715
where is the leader
of your House?

644
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,219
l do not know.

645
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:15,778
Then l say
that the House of Quark

646
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:18,916
has dishonored itself
before this Council

647
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:23,760
and l ask that it be dissolved,
and its land and property

648
00:36:23,797 --> 00:36:26,095
be turned over to me
as compensation for...

649
00:36:33,006 --> 00:36:37,306
l am Quark, son of Keldar

650
00:36:37,344 --> 00:36:42,714
and l have come to answer
the challenge of D'Ghor

651
00:36:42,749 --> 00:36:45,809
son of... whatever.

652
00:36:56,196 --> 00:36:59,359
Whatever happens,
l am proud of you.

653
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:02,527
l wish l could say
that's comforting.

654
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,103
Ready?

655
00:37:10,644 --> 00:37:12,612
Ready?

656
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:15,438
<i>DaH!</i>

657
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:27,925
Go ahead, kill me.

658
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:30,827
That is why l'm here,
isn't it--

659
00:37:30,864 --> 00:37:32,126
to be killed?

660
00:37:32,165 --> 00:37:33,860
Well, here l am.

661
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,027
So go ahead and do it.

662
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:37,832
You all want me
to pick up that sword

663
00:37:37,871 --> 00:37:39,133
and fight him, don't you?

664
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:41,606
But l don't have a chance
and you know it.

665
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:44,109
You only want me
to put up a fight

666
00:37:44,144 --> 00:37:47,602
so that your precious honor
will be satisfied.

667
00:37:47,647 --> 00:37:51,413
Well, l'm not going to make it
so easy for you.

668
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,755
Having me fight D'Ghor

669
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:01,192
is nothing more
than an execution.

670
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:08,896
So, if that's what you want
that's what you'll get--

671
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:11,165
an execution.

672
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:12,466
No honor

673
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:15,270
no glory.

674
00:38:15,308 --> 00:38:18,641
And when you tell your children
and your grandchildren

675
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:21,340
the glorious story
of how you rose to power

676
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:23,849
and took Grilka's House
from her

677
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,047
l hope you remember to tell them

678
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:31,649
how you heroically killed
an unarmed Ferengi...

679
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:33,682
half your size.

680
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:38,923
Whatever you say, Ferengi.

681
00:38:38,965 --> 00:38:42,025
D'Ghor!
What are you doing?

682
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:43,933
l didn't want
to believe the things

683
00:38:44,004 --> 00:38:47,940
he said about you yesterday,
but if you can stand here

684
00:38:47,974 --> 00:38:51,102
and murder
this pathetic little man

685
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:53,408
then you have no honor...

686
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,447
and you have no place
in this hall.

687
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:37,208
A brave Ferengi.

688
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:41,307
Who would have
thought it possible?

689
00:39:49,725 --> 00:39:54,162
l believe there are enough
unusual circumstances here

690
00:39:54,196 --> 00:39:57,927
to justify granting you
special dispensation.

691
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,026
You can lead your House
on your own

692
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,733
if that is what you want.

693
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:09,439
<i>Yej rhin!</i>

694
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:27,495
You have given me back my House
and my family name.

695
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,361
How can l repay you?

696
00:40:29,398 --> 00:40:32,094
l would like a divorce, please.

697
00:40:32,134 --> 00:40:33,897
No offense.

698
00:40:33,936 --> 00:40:36,962
None taken.

699
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,668
l can give it to you right away.

700
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:43,970
<i>N'Gos tlhogh cha!</i>

701
00:40:47,683 --> 00:40:49,913
You're a free man.

702
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:52,182
A little warning
would've been nice.

703
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:03,195
<i>Qapla',</i> Quark...

704
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,496
son of Keldar.

705
00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:08,867
<i>Qapla'</i>to you, too.

706
00:41:30,526 --> 00:41:33,893
l've never understood
what people see in that game.

707
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:36,625
Don't they ever get sick of it?

708
00:41:40,202 --> 00:41:41,965
Keiko...

709
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:44,335
there's an agrobiology
expedition

710
00:41:44,373 --> 00:41:46,967
leaving
for the Janitza mountains

711
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:48,805
on Bajor in two weeks.

712
00:41:48,844 --> 00:41:50,835
They need a chief botanist.

713
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:53,177
l think you could
probably qualify.

714
00:41:53,215 --> 00:41:54,341
On Bajor?

715
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:55,782
That's right.

716
00:41:55,818 --> 00:41:57,979
They've never surveyed
these mountains.

717
00:41:58,053 --> 00:41:59,987
lt's a very important
expedition.

718
00:42:00,055 --> 00:42:03,286
How long is this expedition
supposed to last?

719
00:42:03,325 --> 00:42:05,691
Six months.

720
00:42:05,728 --> 00:42:10,062
l can't leave you
and Molly for six months.

721
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:11,896
You can take Molly with you.

722
00:42:11,934 --> 00:42:13,299
l've already checked.

723
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:14,632
And as for me...

724
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,298
well, Bajor's only three
hours away in a runabout.

725
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:18,772
We can manage.

726
00:42:21,243 --> 00:42:24,144
When we moved here,
we made an agreement...

727
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:25,237
l know.

728
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,841
And l'm not trying
to back out of that agreement.

729
00:42:28,884 --> 00:42:31,717
Don't let this business
about the school

730
00:42:31,754 --> 00:42:33,381
make you feel guilty, and...

731
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:35,185
This isn't about guilt.

732
00:42:35,224 --> 00:42:37,124
This is about you being happy

733
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:39,252
and me knowing that you're not.

734
00:42:43,465 --> 00:42:46,093
l made a promise
to stay with you

735
00:42:46,135 --> 00:42:47,625
and make this work.

736
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,194
l know.

737
00:42:49,238 --> 00:42:51,206
But you're a botanist.

738
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,606
That's what you're
trained to do.

739
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:55,576
That's what you love.

740
00:42:55,611 --> 00:42:57,977
Be a botanist, Keiko.

741
00:42:58,013 --> 00:43:02,074
Be the best damn botanist
in the galaxy.

742
00:43:13,962 --> 00:43:16,726
Brother?

743
00:43:16,765 --> 00:43:19,529
l haven't had
the chance to tell you

744
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:21,229
but in the Great Hall

745
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,932
when you stood there
in front of D'Ghor

746
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:25,597
you were magnificent.

747
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:27,165
l was lucky.

748
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:28,506
lf it didn't work

749
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:30,603
l didn't have
another card to play.

750
00:43:30,646 --> 00:43:32,477
Business is dropping off again.

751
00:43:32,514 --> 00:43:34,141
Money isn't everything.

752
00:43:34,183 --> 00:43:35,616
lf father were alive

753
00:43:35,651 --> 00:43:37,949
he'd wash your mouth
out with galcor.

754
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:39,953
You can't buy respect, brother

755
00:43:39,988 --> 00:43:42,513
and that's what you
have now-- respect.

756
00:43:42,558 --> 00:43:44,685
After all, that's what you
wanted, isn't it?

757
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:49,391
Respect is good,
but latinum's better.

758
00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:52,867
Tell the story again

759
00:43:52,901 --> 00:43:55,631
about how you stood there
in front of D'Ghor

760
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:57,662
not knowing whether you
were going to live

761
00:43:57,706 --> 00:43:58,798
to see another day.

762
00:43:58,841 --> 00:44:00,900
Everyone's tired
of hearing it, Rom.

763
00:44:00,943 --> 00:44:03,070
lt's not going to boost
business anymore.

764
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:06,240
No, l mean... tell me.

765
00:44:06,281 --> 00:44:08,943
l want to hear it again.

766
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:13,215
All right, but l'm
taking this time

767
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:14,950
out of your paycheck.

768
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:20,360
Well, when l entered
the Great Hall

769
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:25,298
the first thing l noticed
was that D'Ghor

770
00:44:25,334 --> 00:44:29,600
was about a meter taller
than l remembered...
