1
00:00:02,261 --> 00:00:05,162
Last time on
<i>Star Trek</i>: <i>Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,721
lf you could do any
science project you wanted to

3
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:09,495
anything at all...

4
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:11,161
Visit the Gamma Quadrant?

5
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:25,112
We've never heard
of the Jem'Hadar.

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,742
Then you've been fortunate.

7
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:30,687
Negotiations with the Dominion
can be a dangerous thing.

8
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:35,182
The Dominion will
no longer stand by

9
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:38,958
and allow ships from your side
to violate our territory.

10
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,624
Starfleet's orders are simple.

11
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,725
Traffic through the wormhole
will be suspended

12
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:44,201
until the <i>Odyssey</i>
can investigate

13
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:45,601
the Jem'Hadar's threat.

14
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:47,127
What about Benjamin
and the others?

15
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,799
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,206
Commander Sisko's return
is a top priority.

17
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:52,766
lf you're going to try
to rescue them

18
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:53,937
then we're coming with you.

19
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,548
Here they come.

20
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:15,494
Major, one
of the Jem'Hadar ships

21
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,001
is making a direct run
at the <i>Odyssey.</i>

22
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,871
The Jem'Hadar wanted us
to escape, didn't they?

23
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:29,540
You have no idea
what's begun here.

24
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,816
She'll be back.

25
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:35,081
The question is
who she'll bring with her.

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,021
lf the Dominion
comes through the wormhole

27
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,524
the first battle
will be fought here

28
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,858
and l intend
to be ready for them.

29
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,728
And now, the continuation.

30
00:01:57,442 --> 00:01:59,876
We're in trouble, people.

31
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,142
We've run seven simulations
and they all come out the same.

32
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,046
The Jem'Hadar
overwhelm our defenses

33
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,142
and board the station
within two hours.

34
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:08,948
Two hours doesn't even
give us time

35
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:10,648
to get reinforcements
from Bajor.

36
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:12,816
There must be something
we overlooked.

37
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:15,326
Major, l'm the last one
to say it's hopeless

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,828
but given DS9's
structural limitations

39
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:19,330
our available power supply

40
00:02:19,364 --> 00:02:21,924
and the difficulty of defending
a stationary target

41
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,730
against a heavily
armed mobile force

42
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,634
l'd say two hours is optimistic.

43
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,001
Well, regardless of the time

44
00:02:27,038 --> 00:02:28,596
the casualties
would be appalling.

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,268
All right, let's say we let
them board the station.

46
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:33,174
That still doesn't mean
we have to surrender.

47
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:34,644
What are you suggesting?

48
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,977
We can, uh...

49
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:40,382
we can hide in the conduits,
set up booby traps

50
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,649
prepare ambushes...
try and hold out

51
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:44,712
until we can get
reinforcements.

52
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,189
We can try,
but l don't think

53
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,851
there'd be
much of a station left

54
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:49,190
by the time they got here.

55
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,524
That leaves us
with two options--

56
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:54,794
abandon the station
and make a stand on Bajor.

57
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:59,361
Or... collapse the entrance
to the wormhole.

58
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:00,837
No, l want a third alternative.

59
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,362
l cannot believe
that we can't...

60
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,678
Some kind of large subspace
surge has just activated

61
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:10,772
our security sensors.

62
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,783
Where is it?

63
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,876
Bearing 148 mark 215.

64
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,614
Distance 300 meters.

65
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,144
300 meters?

66
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,885
That's almost inside
our shield perimeter.

67
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:22,758
From the intensity
in the harmonic signature

68
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:24,455
it could be a cloaked ship

69
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,590
but l've never seen an energy
dispersal pattern like this.

70
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:29,361
lt's too close for comfort,
whatever it is.

71
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:30,368
Red Alert.

72
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:31,369
Raise shields.

73
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:32,768
Energize phaser banks.

74
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:33,896
Stand by to lock
photon torpedoes.

75
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,169
The energy
signature's fluctuating.

76
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:37,299
lt's de-cloaking.

77
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:45,474
lt's definitely
a Federation starship

78
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,451
but l've never seen
that design before.

79
00:03:47,486 --> 00:03:49,920
A Federation ship
with a cloaking device?

80
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:51,183
lt's hailing us.

81
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:52,587
On screen.

82
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:54,517
Hello, Major.

83
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:56,049
Sorry to startle you,
but l wanted

84
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:57,789
to test the <i>Defiant's</i>
cloaking device.

85
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,592
The <i>Defiant?</i>

86
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:02,759
l've brought back a little
surprise for the Dominion.

87
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:11,750
Officially, it's classified
as an escort vessel.

88
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,351
Unofficially,
the <i>Defiant's</i> a warship--

89
00:06:15,393 --> 00:06:17,918
nothing more, nothing less.

90
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:20,124
l thought Starfleet
didn't believe in warships.

91
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:23,328
Desperate times breed
desperate measures, Major.

92
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:27,168
Five years ago, Starfleet
began exploring the possibility

93
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:29,571
of building
a new class of starship.

94
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:32,509
This ship would have
no families, no science labs

95
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:34,535
no luxuries of any kind.

96
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,740
lt was designed
for one purpose only--

97
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:38,874
to fight and defeat the Borg.

98
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,646
The <i>Defiant</i> was a prototype.

99
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:42,744
The first ship
in what would have been

100
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:44,186
a new Federation battle fleet.

101
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:45,621
So what happened?

102
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:47,852
The Borg threat
became less urgent.

103
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:50,020
Also, some design flaws
cropped up

104
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:52,461
during the ship's
shakedown cruise

105
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:54,931
so Starfleet decided
to abandon the project.

106
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,456
What sort of design flaws?

107
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:59,800
You'll have complete access
to the ship evaluation reports

108
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:01,931
but, to put it simply,
it's overgunned

109
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:03,998
and overpowered
for a ship its size.

110
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:06,977
During battle drills,
it nearly tore itself apart

111
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,003
when the engines were tested
at full capacity.

112
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,844
And this is the ship
that Starfleet sends us

113
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,544
to fight off an attack
by the Dominion?

114
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:16,486
We're not going to fight
the Dominion, Major

115
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,182
at least, not yet anyway.

116
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:22,182
Our mission is to take the
<i>Defiant</i> into the Gamma Quadrant

117
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:25,993
and try to find the leaders
of the Dominion, the Founders.

118
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:27,658
We have to convince them
that the Federation

119
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,030
does not represent
a threat to them.

120
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:31,934
What if they don't believe us?

121
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,461
That's why l asked
for the <i>Defiant.</i>

122
00:07:34,506 --> 00:07:37,168
She may have flaws,
but she has teeth

123
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:39,473
and l want the Dominion to know

124
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:43,311
that we can and will defend
ourselves, if necessary.

125
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:47,044
l've posted
two security officers

126
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:49,849
at the <i>Defiant's</i>
docking port, sir.

127
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:51,412
No one will get near
the cloaking device

128
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:52,548
without us knowing about it.

129
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:53,990
l wasn't informed

130
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:56,721
about any special
security arrangements.

131
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:59,457
The security arrangements
were by my request

132
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:01,931
to protect the cloaking device.

133
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:03,594
A few introductions
are in order.

134
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:06,160
This is Subcommander T'Rul,
from the Romulan Empire.

135
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:08,263
She's here to operate
the cloaking device

136
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:09,466
which her government

137
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:11,668
so kindly loaned us
for this mission.

138
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,679
Romulan interests will be
served through cooperation

139
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:17,238
and my role is to keep
unauthorized personnel

140
00:08:17,282 --> 00:08:19,011
away from the cloaking device.

141
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,540
May l present my officers.

142
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:21,677
This is Major Ki...

143
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,120
Thank you,
but l know their names

144
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,521
and l'm not here
to make friends.

145
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,127
Charming.

146
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:33,926
Well, l am here to make friends.

147
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:37,765
l'm Lieutenant Commander
Michael Eddington

148
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,531
Starfleet Security.

149
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:41,971
Major Kira Nerys.

150
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:49,375
Odo, Head of Station Security.

151
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:52,747
May l ask what your function
is here, Commander?

152
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:54,809
There will be
a complete mission briefing

153
00:08:54,853 --> 00:08:56,514
at 1800 hours, but be prepared

154
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:59,216
to depart the station
at 0700 tomorrow morning.

155
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:00,417
Dismissed.

156
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:08,390
You needn't brace yourself

157
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,799
to give me
unpleasant news, Commander.

158
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:12,462
l'll save you the trouble.

159
00:09:12,504 --> 00:09:15,439
l've been relieved
as Chief of Security.

160
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:20,344
Odo, wait!

161
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:21,345
You've not been relieved.

162
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:22,676
You're still in charge

163
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:24,841
of all non-Starfleet security
matters aboard this station.

164
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:26,976
And what about matters
that are Starfleet?

165
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:28,679
ln those areas,
you coordinate your efforts

166
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,709
with Commander Eddington.

167
00:09:29,754 --> 00:09:31,654
''Coordinate'' is
another way of saying

168
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,714
l'll report to him.

169
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,017
l'm sorry, Odo.

170
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:37,424
This wasn't my idea.

171
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:38,759
l'm sure it wasn't.

172
00:09:38,797 --> 00:09:40,355
You were just
following orders.

173
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:42,491
An order l strongly
disagreed with.

174
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:45,162
l did everything
l could to fight this.

175
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:46,363
l even took it

176
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:48,565
to the Chief of Starfleet
Security herself

177
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:50,335
but the decision was final.

178
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,400
May l ask why?

179
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:53,468
There were some concerns

180
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:56,105
about several recent
security breaches.

181
00:09:57,315 --> 00:09:59,681
lf l was given
the authority l asked for

182
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:02,482
instead of being tied
to Starfleet regulations

183
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,353
there wouldn't have been
any security breaches.

184
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,381
Odo, your resistance to
following Starfleet regulations

185
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:09,052
is part of the problem.

186
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:12,552
Well, l think there might be a
simpler explanation, Commander.

187
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:14,497
l think Starfleet
decided to bring in

188
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,022
someone they could trust--

189
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:20,060
someone besides
''the shape-shifter.''

190
00:10:20,105 --> 00:10:23,336
This is not a racial issue, Odo.

191
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,639
l understand
how you must feel, and l...

192
00:10:25,677 --> 00:10:26,974
Commander.

193
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,980
l don't require
your understanding.

194
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:34,007
My resignation will be logged
within the hour.

195
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:47,098
Hey, hey, hey--

196
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:48,756
l thought you were unpacking.

197
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,892
l am.
l mean, l was.

198
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:52,630
But l just kept looking
at the replicator and...

199
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,036
And you just had to have
some l'danian spice pudding.

200
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:56,097
You know, l still can't believe

201
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:57,664
l couldn't get a decent bowl
back on Earth.

202
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,768
That didn't stop you
from ordering it

203
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:01,403
at every replicator you saw.

204
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,038
So...

205
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:04,673
is it good to be home?

206
00:11:04,716 --> 00:11:05,842
Yeah.

207
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:07,909
l can't wait to sleep
in my own bed again.

208
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:10,545
Whew.

209
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:13,216
l wonder when that happened.

210
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:14,725
What?

211
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,253
When did l start thinking
of this Cardassian monstrosity

212
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:21,390
as home?

213
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:23,594
l think it happened...

214
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:25,159
last Thursday.

215
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:28,263
Around 1700 hours--

216
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:31,400
when you took all of this stuff
out of storage back on Earth.

217
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:34,640
l... Careful, that's
a 2,000-year-old Yoruba mask

218
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:37,648
and that ''stuff'' is one
of the finest collections

219
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:38,910
of ancient African art...

220
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,577
You'll ever see.

221
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:41,710
l know.

222
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:44,085
And l also know
how much it means to you.

223
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:46,055
But, to me, this will always be

224
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,524
the stuff in your library...
at home.

225
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,360
When you took it out of storage
so you could bring it here

226
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:55,093
it meant that Earth
wasn't home anymore.

227
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,067
This was.

228
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:02,898
So...

229
00:12:04,242 --> 00:12:05,766
what do you think?

230
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:08,242
Perfect.

231
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:20,781
Odo.

232
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:21,985
There you are.

233
00:12:22,026 --> 00:12:24,756
l just finished talking
to the provisional government

234
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:27,321
and they want you to go with us
to the Gamma Quadrant tomorrow

235
00:12:27,365 --> 00:12:29,265
to act as an official
Bajoran representative.

236
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:31,235
l'm no diplomat.

237
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:32,236
l know.

238
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,204
That's why they want you to go.

239
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,467
lf we do locate the Founders

240
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:37,236
we're going to need
more than diplomacy.

241
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:38,799
We're going to need
to size them up

242
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,276
see what kind
of threat they pose

243
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:41,300
to Bajor, analyze...

244
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:44,179
You're the military
expert, Major, not me.

245
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:47,480
And l doubt

246
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,249
that the provisional
government contacted you

247
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:53,951
and asked for my presence
on this mission.

248
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:55,316
lf l'm not mistaken

249
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:58,850
this is a misguided attempt
to make me feel better.

250
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:01,252
Maybe it is.

251
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:05,323
Maybe l'm your friend.

252
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,088
And maybe l want you to see

253
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:09,221
that you are still
needed here...

254
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:14,360
no matter what some idiot
Starfleet admiral might think.

255
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,281
The <i>Defiant</i> leaves at 700 hours.

256
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:48,461
l'm a little confused,
Commander.

257
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:52,165
You want me to go with you
to the Gamma Quadrant

258
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,403
to help you locate
the Founders.

259
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:59,038
See? lt's not
so confusing after all.

260
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:00,876
You're joking with me,
aren't you?

261
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:02,405
Having a little fun with Quark.

262
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,610
l'm quite serious.

263
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:04,709
You can't be.

264
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:06,083
l'm not a diplomat

265
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,748
or an explorer
or a tactical officer

266
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,519
or whatever else you
might need on this trip.

267
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,858
Now, if you need a caterer,
l'd be happy to loan you

268
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,125
a new replicator
that l just got...

269
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:19,496
Eight months ago,
you helped the Nagus

270
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:22,661
establish a trade agreement
with the Karemma, uh--

271
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:25,297
tulaberry wine, l believe.

272
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,739
The Karemma are
part of the Dominion.

273
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:29,902
A minor part--
a very minor part.

274
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:31,502
They might still
be able to help us

275
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:32,910
make contact with the Founders.

276
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:35,347
Since you're experienced
in dealing with the Karemma,

277
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,543
it seems to me that you're
the logical person...

278
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,610
Actually, my brother Rom
did most of the talking.

279
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:41,883
l think he'd be better suited
for this mission.

280
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,651
Not Rom-- you.

281
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:44,680
But why?

282
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:47,455
Rom only has a son
to think about.

283
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,019
l have a business.

284
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,054
You.

285
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:58,002
l'm sorry, Commander,
but l must refuse.

286
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:00,632
My last experience
with the Jem'Hadar

287
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:02,198
was not a pleasant one

288
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:04,973
and l have no intention
of repeating it.

289
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:09,948
Now, there's no way you can
legally force me to do this.

290
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,082
The scepter of the Grand Nagus.

291
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,991
l had a chance to discuss
this mission with him

292
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:21,755
on my way back from Earth.

293
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,092
He seemed to agree with me.

294
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,256
Unless peaceful contact

295
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,266
can be established
with the Founders

296
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,598
business opportunities
in the Gamma Quadrant

297
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,967
might suddenly dry up.

298
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:34,703
He also agreed with me that you
are the perfect man to help me.

299
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:36,767
l don't believe it.

300
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,175
Which is why he sent this along.

301
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:39,577
He thought it might convince you

302
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:44,448
of the high value he holds
for the success of this mission.

303
00:15:45,586 --> 00:15:46,951
Now...

304
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,852
are you going to defy

305
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:52,325
the wishes of the Grand Nagus
himself?

306
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,020
No, no... of course not.

307
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:57,154
l'm happy to serve the Nagus
any way l can.

308
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:58,164
Thanks, Quark.

309
00:15:58,198 --> 00:15:59,722
l knew l could count on you.

310
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:01,234
Yeah.

311
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,595
Quark?

312
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:06,538
Aren't you forgetting something?

313
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,832
Oh.

314
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,000
l just thought
you'd like to know.

315
00:16:40,074 --> 00:16:42,099
The <i>Defiant</i> will be
ready at 0700 hours.

316
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:43,575
Did it pass
the Chief's inspection?

317
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:44,635
Does anything?

318
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:46,578
His maintenance list
is as long as this table.

319
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:48,673
But he did say it will
take us where we're going.

320
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,776
And back, l hope.

321
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:53,684
Well, he said
that was up to you.

322
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,121
l'd never have volunteered
for this mission

323
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:59,023
if l didn't think we had
a chance of coming back.

324
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,289
How many times
did Curzon tell you

325
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:03,228
never volunteer for anything?

326
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:06,755
As l recall, Curzon broke
that rule a few times himself.

327
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,825
And regretted it every time.

328
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,461
This is different.

329
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:12,495
l'd be regretting it even more

330
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,303
if we just waited around
for an invasion.

331
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:23,777
lf l know Starfleet,
they must have run

332
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:28,083
at least 200 probability studies
on this mission of ours.

333
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:30,989
So what are the odds
of us succeeding?

334
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:32,959
Slim.

335
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:37,289
But better odds
than fighting off

336
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:39,697
a Jem'Hadar assault
on this station.

337
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:42,531
And if the station falls,
then Bajor falls

338
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,696
and l will not let that happen.

339
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:50,440
You know, after Jennifer died

340
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:53,674
l never thought l would
see you this passionate

341
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:55,375
about something again.

342
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,874
Two months ago, l would
have agreed with you.

343
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,944
Then l went back to Earth

344
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:04,151
and l spent all
those weeks debriefing

345
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:06,455
at Starfleet Headquarters.

346
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:07,551
And l...

347
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,093
l used to get a thrill
just walking into that building.

348
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,226
l'd look around at the admirals

349
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:18,102
and think, ''One day,
that's going to be me.

350
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,503
''One day, l'm the one

351
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,566
that's going to be making
the big decisions.''

352
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:26,644
Curzon always thought
that was very funny.

353
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,647
Did he?

354
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:28,978
What l mean is

355
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,985
he could never see a set of
admiral stars on your collar.

356
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:35,920
He thought that just
making the decisions

357
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:37,651
would never satisfy you.

358
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:39,625
You had to implement them--

359
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,824
see the results,
face the consequences.

360
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:47,197
Curzon always thought
you were the kind of man

361
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:49,828
who had to be
in the thick of things--

362
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,839
not behind some desk
at Headquarters.

363
00:18:56,143 --> 00:19:00,580
He was a smart old man,
wasn't he?

364
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:03,082
He'd like to think so.

365
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:10,254
You'd better get
a good night's sleep.

366
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,282
l was just about to say
the same thing to you.

367
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:15,818
l'll see you
in the morning, Benjamin.

368
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,101
The medical database
is practically nonexistent.

369
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:31,736
l've downloaded
as many of my files

370
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:32,973
from the station as l can

371
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,674
but this ship
simply wasn't designed

372
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,977
to handle many casualties.

373
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:37,574
Do the best you can,
and let's hope we don't

374
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:39,483
have to put your new
database to a test.

375
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,646
Yes, sir.

376
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:42,120
Quark's settling
into his quarters

377
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:46,092
and asked me to relay to you
his profound disappointment

378
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:48,560
in the accommodations,
and to inform you

379
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:49,994
that he could
get you in touch

380
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,156
with several reputable
interior decorators

381
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:53,723
for a modest fee.

382
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,962
l'll take his offer
under advisement.

383
00:19:56,003 --> 00:19:57,766
Stand by to get underway.

384
00:19:57,805 --> 00:20:00,000
Tactical and communications
are ready, sir.

385
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,268
Navigation and operations,
ready.

386
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:03,817
Weapons ready.

387
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,315
lmpulse engines on-line.

388
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:06,717
Warp power available
at your command.

389
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:08,380
Very well.

390
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,185
Seal the airlock,
release docking clamps, aft...

391
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:12,953
Just a moment, sir.

392
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:15,961
There's someone in the airlock.

393
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:17,258
lt's Odo.

394
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:20,590
Sisko to Odo.

395
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:22,568
ls there a problem, Constable?

396
00:20:22,602 --> 00:20:26,060
No, Commander. l would like
permission to come aboard.

397
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:31,203
l'm here at the request
of the Bajoran government.

398
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:32,575
Permission granted.

399
00:20:32,612 --> 00:20:34,603
Thank you, sir.

400
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:37,412
Dax, we'll have to arrange
some quarters for the Constable.

401
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,644
l'll do it, sir.

402
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:41,620
l need to go down to what is
laughingly called the Sick Bay.

403
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:42,713
Thank you, Doctor.

404
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:43,984
Odo's aboard, sir.

405
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:45,251
The airlock's clear.

406
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:46,691
Release docking clamps.

407
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:48,489
Aft thrusters at one quarter.

408
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:50,860
Port and starboard
at station keeping.

409
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:09,341
We've cleared the station.

410
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:11,407
Lay in a course
to the wormhole.

411
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:13,282
l want to cloak as soon as
we reach the Gamma Quadrant.

412
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,480
Understood.

413
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:17,587
Course laid in, sir.

414
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:19,649
Engage.

415
00:21:43,783 --> 00:21:48,243
The cloaking device is operating
within normal parameters.

416
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:50,882
Set course
for the Karemma system.

417
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:51,982
Warp 7.

418
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:52,992
Aye, sir.

419
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:54,357
Engage.

420
00:21:57,464 --> 00:21:58,522
Odo!

421
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:04,762
ls this the best you can do?

422
00:22:04,804 --> 00:22:06,362
l'm afraid so.

423
00:22:06,406 --> 00:22:08,874
Most of the crew quarters
don't have life supports yet.

424
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:11,172
Besides, l think
we'd all feel a bit better

425
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:13,236
with someone here
to watch over Quark.

426
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,771
l take that
as a personal insult, Doctor.

427
00:22:16,816 --> 00:22:18,477
You should.

428
00:22:18,518 --> 00:22:21,612
Now, l think
l'll let you two bunkmates

429
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:23,383
get more comfortable.

430
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,686
Am l glad to see you.

431
00:22:26,726 --> 00:22:29,786
l have been stuck
down here in this miserable hole

432
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:31,490
ever since l came on board.

433
00:22:31,531 --> 00:22:32,555
Bunk beds!

434
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,759
No view.

435
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,961
And l can't tell
you what came out

436
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:39,096
of that replicator when
l asked for synthehol.

437
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:42,703
So...

438
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:45,734
what's your role
in this little adventure?

439
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:48,304
Providing security, no doubt.

440
00:22:48,348 --> 00:22:50,441
Well, of course you are.

441
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:53,577
l mean, why else
would you be here?

442
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,986
l can tell you,
l feel much safer now

443
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:58,855
just knowing you're along,
because l know...

444
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:03,659
l have been holding
this shape for 16 hours.

445
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:06,859
l have to revert back
to my liquid state

446
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,563
but l don't want you to watch
and gawk at me!

447
00:23:10,603 --> 00:23:14,369
l understand, completely.

448
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:19,401
This is a very private moment
and l won't interfere.

449
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:25,878
This won't be so bad...

450
00:23:28,488 --> 00:23:31,685
l have no interest
in speaking to you

451
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:35,182
or in listening
to your witless prattle!

452
00:23:35,228 --> 00:23:37,093
So stay out of my way

453
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,759
or you'll regret
the day you ever met me!

454
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:57,613
Commander, long-range sensors

455
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,142
have picked up two Jem'Hadar
warships directly ahead.

456
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:03,678
They're heading
this way at warp 5.

457
00:24:03,723 --> 00:24:05,850
How close will they pass us?

458
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:07,359
100,000 kilometers.

459
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:10,226
That's well within range
of their weapons, Commander.

460
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:12,026
Should l alter course?

461
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:14,932
No, we need to know if they can
see through the cloaking device

462
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:16,525
and this is
as good a time as any.

463
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:18,696
Maintain course and speed.

464
00:24:18,738 --> 00:24:19,705
Red Alert.

465
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:21,639
Aye, sir.

466
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:23,801
Here they come.

467
00:24:23,843 --> 00:24:26,038
They'll pass us in five seconds.

468
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,341
On screen.

469
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,371
Track them.

470
00:24:29,415 --> 00:24:32,509
They're continuing
on their original heading.

471
00:24:32,552 --> 00:24:34,349
No indication that they saw us.

472
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:36,377
Wait a minute.

473
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:38,117
They're changing course.

474
00:24:38,158 --> 00:24:39,386
Heading this way.

475
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:40,949
They must have seen us.

476
00:24:41,027 --> 00:24:42,688
They're powering
their weapon systems.

477
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:45,197
Prepare to de-cloak,
lock phasers on the lead ship...

478
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:46,823
No! We may not have
been detected.

479
00:24:46,866 --> 00:24:47,890
Explain.

480
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:50,767
A cloaked ship radiates
a slight subspace variance

481
00:24:50,803 --> 00:24:51,827
at warp speeds.

482
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:53,270
l never heard that.

483
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:55,797
lt's not something
we've been eager to reveal.

484
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:57,776
l suggest dropping out of warp.

485
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,903
That will eliminate
the variance.

486
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:03,382
When they reach our position,
they'll find nothing.

487
00:25:05,218 --> 00:25:06,310
Do it.

488
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:07,478
All stop.

489
00:25:15,695 --> 00:25:17,424
Commander,
they're sweeping the area

490
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:19,260
with some kind
of an anti-proton scan

491
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:21,699
and they're being
very thorough about it.

492
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:24,066
Will an anti-proton scan
penetrate the cloak?

493
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:25,730
That's a good question.

494
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:29,102
l'm not sure.

495
00:25:30,376 --> 00:25:31,434
They're getting closer.

496
00:25:31,477 --> 00:25:33,206
Commander.

497
00:25:33,246 --> 00:25:34,941
The <i>Defiant's</i> power signature

498
00:25:34,981 --> 00:25:37,245
is unusually high
for a ship this size.

499
00:25:37,283 --> 00:25:40,047
The cloaking device
may not be masking everything.

500
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:44,750
Cut main power.

501
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:56,968
The other one
has broken off its search.

502
00:25:57,003 --> 00:25:57,970
lt's headed this way.

503
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:00,529
Stand by weapons and shields.

504
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:21,055
They've gone into warp...

505
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:22,823
and resumed
their original course.

506
00:26:24,297 --> 00:26:25,855
The first thing to go right

507
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:28,059
in the Gamma Quadrant
in a long time.

508
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:30,592
Let's hope it's not the last.

509
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,916
Ship's Log, Stardate 48212.4.

510
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:46,942
We have arrived
at the Karemma home world

511
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,750
and opened talks with one
of Quark's business partners

512
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:52,485
in an effort to contact
the Founders of the Dominion.

513
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:54,322
The Grand Nagus himself

514
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,818
has sent me as an emissary
on his behalf.

515
00:26:57,864 --> 00:26:59,525
lf you aid us in our mission

516
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:01,999
l'm authorized
to increase our purchase

517
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:05,835
of tulaberry wine
to the Karemma by three percent.

518
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:09,603
Hmm, looks like
a polyduranium alloy blend.

519
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:13,510
lnteresting, but the metal
has no real value.

520
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:16,014
A three percent
increase is negligible.

521
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:20,247
l have considerable leeway
to bargain in this circumstance.

522
00:27:20,286 --> 00:27:21,344
Name your terms.

523
00:27:21,387 --> 00:27:23,582
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

524
00:27:23,623 --> 00:27:26,285
The terms are not the issue.

525
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:27,691
l cannot help you
locate the Founders

526
00:27:27,727 --> 00:27:29,285
because l do not know
who they are

527
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:31,729
or if they even exist.

528
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:32,731
Nothing.

529
00:27:32,765 --> 00:27:35,700
Ah, here's something
interesting.

530
00:27:35,735 --> 00:27:37,417
Appears to be
diamide-laced beritium.

531
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:39,009
Appears to be
diamide-laced beritium.

532
00:27:39,052 --> 00:27:41,020
l'll give you 52 diraks for it.

533
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:42,021
Done.

534
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:43,022
Quark.

535
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:44,751
l mean, one bargain
at a time, Ornithar.

536
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:46,850
We were talking
about the Founders.

537
00:27:46,893 --> 00:27:48,690
There is nothing further to say.

538
00:27:48,728 --> 00:27:49,922
lf the Founders exist

539
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:52,227
they clearly do not wish
to be contacted

540
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:54,062
and that is good enough for me.

541
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,728
Who's your contact
in the Dominion

542
00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:59,932
regarding administration,
trade, defense?

543
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:01,564
Our only contact
with the Dominion

544
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:02,870
has been through the Vorta.

545
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,876
l have no idea
who they report to.

546
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:08,539
All l know is that the Vorta say
to do something and you do it.

547
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:09,980
Why?

548
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:13,975
Because if you do not, they
will send in the Jem'Hadar...

549
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,282
and then you die.

550
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:17,255
Will you put us in contact
with the Vorta?

551
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,656
Commander, we do only
as we are told, nothing more.

552
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:23,526
And so far, we have not been
told to help you in any way.

553
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:25,827
You haven't been told not to,
either.

554
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:28,834
No, but l prefer to err
on the side of caution.

555
00:28:28,868 --> 00:28:30,893
ln this case, being cautious
will cost you

556
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,164
a substantial profit.

557
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:33,638
The Ferengi will cease

558
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:36,164
purchasing tulaberry
wine immediately.

559
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:38,006
lf you lost such
a valuable contract

560
00:28:38,044 --> 00:28:40,672
with the Alpha Quadrant,
it might displease the Vorta.

561
00:28:40,713 --> 00:28:43,705
They may even send the Jem'Hadar
to find out what happened.

562
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:48,943
l will need to access one
of our computers on the surface.

563
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:57,659
This is the Callinon system.

564
00:28:57,697 --> 00:28:59,392
The Dominion maintains

565
00:28:59,432 --> 00:29:02,026
an unmanned subspace relay
on the seventh planet.

566
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:03,592
We have been told by the Vorta

567
00:29:03,636 --> 00:29:05,399
to direct
all communications there.

568
00:29:05,438 --> 00:29:09,738
Where the messages are sent
after that is not our concern.

569
00:29:09,776 --> 00:29:12,768
What is that?

570
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:15,872
lt is the Omarion Nebula.

571
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:21,148
The Omarion Nebula...

572
00:29:23,756 --> 00:29:27,658
lf there is nothing else,
l would like to leave now.

573
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:28,752
Of course.

574
00:29:28,795 --> 00:29:31,389
Uh, Commander, l believe

575
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:33,058
l fulfilled my role
in this mission

576
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:34,157
so if you don't mind...

577
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,065
You want to stay behind?

578
00:29:36,102 --> 00:29:38,002
That was our agreement.

579
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:39,004
How can you be sure

580
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:40,665
he won't turn you
over to the Dominion

581
00:29:40,707 --> 00:29:41,674
as soon as we leave?

582
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,266
He may serve the Dominion

583
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:46,335
but l'm the one lining
his pockets with latinum.

584
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:47,869
l'll book passage

585
00:29:47,914 --> 00:29:51,645
on the next ship going
through the wormhole

586
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:55,017
and, uh, l'll make a profit
in the process.

587
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:56,351
All right, Quark.

588
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:58,323
Good luck.

589
00:29:58,358 --> 00:30:00,223
Same to you, Commander.

590
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:04,921
Lay in a course
for the Callinon system.

591
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:06,225
Aye, sir.

592
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,568
Come in.

593
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:22,743
Did l wake you?

594
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:25,717
Not quite.

595
00:30:25,752 --> 00:30:27,686
What can l do for you, Major?

596
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,483
lt's about Odo.

597
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,118
You're worried about him.

598
00:30:32,158 --> 00:30:33,921
ls it that obvious?

599
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,428
No, l'm worried about him, too.

600
00:30:36,462 --> 00:30:40,592
But, at the moment, l don't know
what to do about it.

601
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:42,931
Can l speak freely?

602
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,770
What the hell is wrong
with Starfleet?!

603
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:48,205
How could they do this to him?

604
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:50,072
This has been a long time
coming, Major.

605
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:52,441
Starfleet has never been
happy with the Constable.

606
00:30:52,478 --> 00:30:54,275
They've been pressing me
to replace him

607
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:55,405
for the last two years.

608
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:57,882
Because he worked
for the Cardassians.

609
00:30:57,917 --> 00:30:59,077
No, it goes deeper than that.

610
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:01,211
Odo is not what you'd call
a team player.

611
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:02,551
Why? Because sometimes he

612
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:04,579
doesn't go through
the proper channels?

613
00:31:04,624 --> 00:31:06,023
Well, that's a start.

614
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:07,458
You know Odo.

615
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:09,085
He enjoys thumbing his nose
at authority.

616
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:12,188
He files reports
when he feels like it.

617
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:14,597
His respect for the chain
of command is minimal.

618
00:31:14,634 --> 00:31:15,862
He gets the job done.

619
00:31:15,902 --> 00:31:18,234
Starfleet likes team players.

620
00:31:18,271 --> 00:31:21,104
Starfleet likes
the chain of command

621
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,937
and, frankly, so do l.

622
00:31:22,975 --> 00:31:25,068
So you agree
with their decision?

623
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:26,874
No, but l understand it.

624
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:28,881
And when this mission is over,
you're just going to let him go?

625
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:31,145
Look, Major, l want him
to stay as much as you do

626
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:32,446
but he has to want to stay.

627
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:34,180
Bridge to Commander Sisko.

628
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,711
We've reached
the Callinon system.

629
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:38,451
On my way.

630
00:31:43,896 --> 00:31:45,864
Ship's Log, supplemental.

631
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:47,058
The <i>Defiant</i> has cloaked

632
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,864
and assumed standard orbit
around Callinon Vll.

633
00:31:49,902 --> 00:31:51,335
l plan to send Dax and O'Brien

634
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,668
down to survey the relay station
on the surface.

635
00:31:53,706 --> 00:31:55,674
According to our sensor sweeps

636
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:57,573
it looks like Ornithar
was telling the truth

637
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,510
when he said the relay
station was unmanned.

638
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:03,003
lt also appears there are very
few security measures in place.

639
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:04,141
Nothing fancy.

640
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:05,912
Get in, find what we
need and get out.

641
00:32:05,952 --> 00:32:06,919
Understood.

642
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:08,682
On your way.

643
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:12,088
The transporter will need
six seconds to beam them down.

644
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:15,117
l want to de-cloak
for exactly six seconds.

645
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:16,128
Dax to Bridge.

646
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:17,629
We're ready, Benjamin.

647
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:18,755
All right.

648
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:20,766
Disengage cloak.

649
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,994
Energize.

650
00:32:24,737 --> 00:32:26,261
They're on the surface.

651
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:28,569
Were we scanned
during transport?

652
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:29,734
l don't think so.

653
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:31,073
Dax to <i>Defiant.</i>

654
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,236
Go ahead, Dax.

655
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:35,714
We're in what seems to be
the central computer room.

656
00:32:35,748 --> 00:32:38,410
The user interface
is a little unusual

657
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:40,476
but l think we can access it.

658
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,147
Keep us posted.

659
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:46,450
l'm into the main directory.

660
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:47,959
That was fast.

661
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,960
Yes, it was.

662
00:32:49,996 --> 00:32:51,896
A bit too fast, if you ask me.

663
00:32:51,931 --> 00:32:53,592
Any indication
that we've tripped

664
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:55,191
some kind of
security protocol?

665
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:58,431
No, l still have
access to everything.

666
00:32:58,471 --> 00:33:00,996
Then let's get the information
and get out of here.

667
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,564
That's fine with me.

668
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:11,074
l've should have taken
Quark up on his offer

669
00:33:11,117 --> 00:33:12,141
for a new replicator.

670
00:33:12,185 --> 00:33:13,152
Sir?

671
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:14,244
Nothing.

672
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:16,084
Let's make good use
of this time, Major.

673
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:17,783
Begin running a level-3
diagnostic...

674
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,791
Dax to <i>Defiant.</i>

675
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:20,690
l think we have something,
Benjamin.

676
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:22,887
We've accessed
a communications log

677
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:24,521
of outgoing transmissions.

678
00:33:24,564 --> 00:33:25,929
From the way l read this, sir

679
00:33:26,032 --> 00:33:28,159
it looks like 80%
of all outgoing traffic

680
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:29,668
is sent to one location.

681
00:33:29,702 --> 00:33:33,729
lt's my guess it's either
another relay station

682
00:33:33,773 --> 00:33:34,797
or a command center.

683
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:36,502
Do you have the coordinates?

684
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:38,635
l'm sending them to you now.

685
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,177
We've lost contact with them.

686
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:44,581
Get them out of there!

687
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:45,675
l can't.

688
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:47,618
Some kind of shield has
appeared around the outpost.

689
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:48,620
l can't get through it.

690
00:33:52,592 --> 00:33:54,457
We're picking up three
Jem'Hadar ships, Commander

691
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:55,482
heading this way.

692
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:57,155
Can we punch
through the security shield

693
00:33:57,196 --> 00:33:58,959
with our phasers
before the ships get here?

694
00:33:58,998 --> 00:33:59,965
l'm not sure.

695
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:01,432
l've never seen
this kind of field before.

696
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:03,833
ln order to use the phasers,
we will have to de-cloak.

697
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,895
That means, we'll be seen
by the Jem'Hadar.

698
00:34:05,972 --> 00:34:07,337
Well, we've got to do something.

699
00:34:07,373 --> 00:34:08,704
We can't just leave them there.

700
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:10,606
That's exactly
what we should do, Doctor.

701
00:34:10,643 --> 00:34:11,610
Leave them.

702
00:34:11,644 --> 00:34:13,612
We came here to locate
the Founders.

703
00:34:13,646 --> 00:34:15,910
Not to fight the Jem'Hadar

704
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:17,744
over two expendable
crew members.

705
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:18,909
No one is expendable.

706
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:20,418
The Jem'Hadar have
entered the system.

707
00:34:20,453 --> 00:34:22,353
They'll be in orbit
in 30 seconds.

708
00:34:32,298 --> 00:34:33,784
Prepare to leave orbit, Major.

709
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:34,884
Commander...

710
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,283
As you were, Doctor.

711
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,017
Lay in a course
to the coordinates Dax sent us.

712
00:34:42,726 --> 00:34:44,489
Course laid in.

713
00:34:44,528 --> 00:34:47,520
Warp 7. Engage.

714
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:06,972
What do you think will happen
to Dax and O'Brien?

715
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:09,986
They'll probably be held
for interrogation.

716
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,818
lf l know Dax,
she'll use the opportunity

717
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:15,950
to try to contact the Founders,
and l intend to do the same.

718
00:35:15,993 --> 00:35:19,394
Sisko to Odo.
Report to the Bridge, Constable.

719
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:21,863
l want to discuss the security
arrangements for our...

720
00:35:21,899 --> 00:35:24,367
l'm presently indisposed,
Commander.

721
00:35:24,401 --> 00:35:26,460
Please find someone else
for the job.

722
00:35:26,503 --> 00:35:28,130
That doesn't sound like Odo.

723
00:35:28,171 --> 00:35:29,331
No, it doesn't.

724
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:31,671
l'd better have a talk with him.

725
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,005
Uh, let me, sir.

726
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:35,511
l think he'll listen to me.

727
00:35:35,545 --> 00:35:39,003
Three Jem'Hadar ships
have just entered sensor range.

728
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,574
Bearing 037 mark 215.

729
00:35:41,618 --> 00:35:43,347
ls there any sign
they've detected us?

730
00:35:43,387 --> 00:35:44,411
Negative.

731
00:35:44,454 --> 00:35:46,615
Bring us out of warp
and then cut main power.

732
00:35:46,657 --> 00:35:48,420
We'll wait here until they pass.

733
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:01,063
Odo, it's time we had a talk.

734
00:36:01,104 --> 00:36:05,598
l'm not going to the Bridge,
so you can save your breath.

735
00:36:05,642 --> 00:36:09,339
And l'd appreciate being
left alone right now.

736
00:36:09,379 --> 00:36:12,974
Well, you tried being alone
and it hasn't done any good.

737
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:16,918
So maybe it's time to stop
brooding and start talking.

738
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:20,482
Are you the ship's counselor
now?

739
00:36:20,524 --> 00:36:24,324
No... l'm your friend.

740
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:26,295
You know, the one
who comes to you

741
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,558
when she needs help.

742
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:33,227
l'm just trying
to return the favor.

743
00:36:34,271 --> 00:36:36,171
Well, you can return the favor

744
00:36:36,206 --> 00:36:39,107
by giving me a shuttlecraft
and letting me go.

745
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:41,133
Go? Go where?

746
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:43,544
We're in the heart
of the Dominion.

747
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,481
Where the hell do you think
you're gonna go?

748
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:49,746
The Omarion Nebula.

749
00:36:52,422 --> 00:36:53,889
Why?

750
00:36:53,957 --> 00:36:56,585
l'm not sure why.

751
00:36:56,626 --> 00:36:59,823
l just know l have to,
that's all.

752
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:04,493
Y-You... you're going to have
to do a lot better than that.

753
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,566
Odo...

754
00:37:09,606 --> 00:37:10,800
talk to me.

755
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:13,503
Tell me what's going on.

756
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:21,511
Ever since we've come
into the Gamma Quadrant...

757
00:37:21,551 --> 00:37:26,454
l've had this feeling...
of being drawn somewhere

758
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:32,895
pulled by some instinct
to a specific place--

759
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:36,896
the Omarion Nebula.

760
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:39,263
Why there?

761
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,099
l don't know.

762
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:45,872
All right.

763
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:48,867
Once we've contacted
the Founders

764
00:37:48,945 --> 00:37:50,207
l'm sure Commander Sisko...

765
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:51,771
No!

766
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:55,046
Not after we've contacted
the Founders-- now!

767
00:37:55,085 --> 00:37:56,609
l have to leave now!

768
00:37:56,653 --> 00:37:59,417
Look, l understand
this is important to you

769
00:37:59,456 --> 00:38:01,083
but we have a mission to...

770
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:06,619
Direct hit on the port nacelle!

771
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:09,063
How did they see through
the cloaking device?

772
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:10,828
They might have analyzed
the sensor information

773
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:12,391
on the anti-proton scan

774
00:38:12,436 --> 00:38:14,199
and found a way
to penetrate the cloak.

775
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:17,464
We'll have to save
the speculation for later.

776
00:38:17,507 --> 00:38:21,273
Disengage the cloak, raise the
shields and fire on my command!

777
00:38:36,193 --> 00:38:38,855
Communications
and long-range sensors are out!

778
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:40,658
What's the status
of the warp drive?

779
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:42,494
The starboard power coupling
is destroyed!

780
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:44,966
l'm trying
to reroute main power!

781
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:52,738
He's gone!

782
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:53,902
l'll take the helm!

783
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:57,240
Locking onto the lead ship!

784
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,577
-Ready?
-Ready!

785
00:38:58,615 --> 00:38:59,604
Fire!

786
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:08,288
The other two are moving
out of phaser range.

787
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:11,123
They're coming back
for another pass.

788
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:13,755
They're moving
a little slower now.

789
00:39:13,797 --> 00:39:15,822
They'll be
more cautious this time.

790
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:18,196
Doctor, use
evasive pattern delta-5.

791
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:21,602
We need to keep them off balance
until we get warp power back.

792
00:39:21,638 --> 00:39:22,730
Aye, sir.

793
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:29,075
Are you all right?

794
00:39:29,112 --> 00:39:30,306
Just a few bruises.

795
00:39:30,347 --> 00:39:32,042
Kira to Bridge.

796
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:34,016
Kira to Bridge!

797
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,644
We have to get up there.

798
00:39:38,088 --> 00:39:40,318
T'Rul, where's my warp power?

799
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:43,019
l can't get the phase inducers
to align

800
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:44,026
with the ODN matrixes!

801
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,051
Commander, three more
Jem'Hadar warships

802
00:39:46,096 --> 00:39:47,586
approaching off the port bow!

803
00:39:47,631 --> 00:39:49,997
Full impulse!
Get us out of here!

804
00:39:51,535 --> 00:39:53,127
We've lost main power.

805
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,297
We've got to get to a shuttle.

806
00:39:55,338 --> 00:39:57,863
Our duty is to get to the Bridge
and help defend the ship.

807
00:39:57,974 --> 00:40:01,137
lf main power is out,
then the shields are out, Kira.

808
00:40:01,178 --> 00:40:02,645
The ship is defenseless!

809
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:16,558
Main power is off-line!

810
00:40:16,593 --> 00:40:18,857
The shields have collapsed!

811
00:40:18,895 --> 00:40:20,829
l've lost helm control.

812
00:40:20,864 --> 00:40:23,162
lnertial dampers failing.

813
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,497
Ready escape pods.

814
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:26,502
Prepare to abandon ship.

815
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:27,356
Where am l?

816
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:31,500
You're in a shuttlecraft.

817
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:32,967
You were wounded.

818
00:41:33,003 --> 00:41:34,151
Try not to move around.

819
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:44,119
Odo, what happened?

820
00:41:44,161 --> 00:41:46,186
We were under attack.

821
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:49,660
The ship was boarded.

822
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,225
You were wounded in the attack.

823
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:55,102
l managed to get us
to the shuttlecraft

824
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:57,868
but l don't know
much more than that.

825
00:41:57,908 --> 00:42:02,811
The last time l saw the <i>Defiant,</i>
she was dead in space

826
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:06,247
and surrounded
by Jem'Hadar ships.

827
00:42:06,283 --> 00:42:08,148
Sisko? Bashir?

828
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:11,777
l don't know.

829
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:24,332
Where are we?

830
00:42:24,368 --> 00:42:28,964
We're approaching
the Omarion Nebula.

831
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:31,167
You should have taken us
back to the wormhole.

832
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:34,243
You didn't object at the time.

833
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:36,143
l was unconscious.

834
00:42:41,985 --> 00:42:43,316
You found anything?

835
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:52,391
That's a Class-M planet.

836
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:53,691
No star system.

837
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,357
A rogue planet?

838
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:57,424
Yes.

839
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,380
Welcome home.
