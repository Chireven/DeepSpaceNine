1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,463
l don't know about you,
but l'm starving.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,467
Me, too.

3
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:10,832
Here you go.
Enjoy.

4
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:12,166
Thanks.

5
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:13,535
This looks delicious.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,667
Now, Constable,
the secret of a good soufflé

7
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:18,903
is consistency.

8
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,640
You have to be careful
not to overwhip it.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,170
l see.

10
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:25,478
l hope l'm not boring you.

11
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:28,281
Just because l don't
need food, Commander

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,517
doesn't mean l'm not interested
in its preparation.

13
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:35,652
l'm fascinated by the humanoid
preoccupation with eating.

14
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:38,024
Oh, uh, may l?

15
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:39,189
By all means.

16
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:41,199
Ow.

17
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:46,599
Ah...

18
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:49,567
Uh, nice and smooth.

19
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:52,301
That's it.

20
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,743
lt's all in the wrist.

21
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:57,545
Where did you learn all this?

22
00:00:57,582 --> 00:01:00,073
ln my father's restaurant
in New Orleans.

23
00:01:00,118 --> 00:01:01,278
What are we having?

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,582
lt smells delicious.

25
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:03,610
Blackened red fish

26
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:05,885
with creamed spinach
and sautéed beets.

27
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:07,858
Beets?

28
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:10,088
You don't like beets, Doctor?

29
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:11,925
Well, they're not exactly

30
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:14,488
a, a personal favorite
of mine, no.

31
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,366
That's because you haven't
had them prepared properly.

32
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:23,273
Beets are a very
misunderstood vegetable.

33
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:26,835
Well, l look forward
to understanding it better.

34
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:30,205
Come in.

35
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,274
Oh, what a day.

36
00:01:32,317 --> 00:01:34,751
l just spent six hours
in one of the upper pylons

37
00:01:34,786 --> 00:01:36,947
trying to get the new
sensor relay on line.

38
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:38,683
Help yourself to something.

39
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,351
Dinner will be ready
in a few minutes.

40
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,654
Great.

41
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:44,355
l've been looking forward
to this all day.

42
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,193
l hope you like beets.

43
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:48,630
l love 'em.

44
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,464
Keep at it, Constable.

45
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:52,129
Nice, even strokes.

46
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,207
You find something amusing,
Major?

47
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,236
Oh, l just think you look so...

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,180
cute, l...

49
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:15,787
Whose is this?

50
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:17,658
lt's mine.

51
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:20,488
l didn't know that you played.

52
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:22,022
l don't.

53
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:23,898
l took lessons for a while

54
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,664
but, uh, l wasn't very good.

55
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:27,763
Oh, l know the feeling.

56
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,135
None of Dax's hosts--
even Jadzia--

57
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:32,734
had any musical ability.

58
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,746
Nobody said life was fair.

59
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,180
Even if you had seven of them.

60
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:39,046
You would think one of us

61
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:42,019
would have been born
without a tin ear.

62
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:45,181
Sounds like one of you
had some talent after all.

63
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:51,155
That's lovely.

64
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:52,185
Quiet!

65
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:12,275
That's not it!

66
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,279
What piece was that?

67
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,653
l don't know.

68
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,681
l don't believe
l've ever heard it before.

69
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:23,159
Maybe you hit
on it by accident.

70
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:25,456
You know, beginner's luck.

71
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,524
But l know it somehow.

72
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,538
lt's probably something
from your childhood.

73
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:34,561
You'll think of it.

74
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:36,233
Dinner is ready.

75
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:55,219
Do you mind?

76
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:56,389
What?

77
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:57,489
You're humming.

78
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:59,432
lt's a little distracting.

79
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:03,904
l'm sorry, l didn't realize
l was doing it.

80
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:05,963
You've been humming
that same tune

81
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:08,168
since we started the game.

82
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,336
Guess l just can't get it
out of my mind.

83
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,379
Do me a favor...

84
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:16,349
try.

85
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:40,704
Your turn.

86
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:48,338
You sure you want to do that?

87
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:50,544
Your move.

88
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:56,048
Check.

89
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:59,251
Where did that knight come from?

90
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,989
Your mind is not on the game.

91
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:04,690
So you decided to make
an illegal move

92
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:06,165
to get my attention.

93
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,462
Of course not

94
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:09,697
and it's a legal move.

95
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:12,365
You know, why don't
we just call it a day?

96
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:15,274
You obviously have other things
on your mind.

97
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:19,405
Curzon always suspected
you were a cheat.

98
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:22,280
ls this some kind of joke?

99
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,750
Don't play innocent
with me, Benjamin.

100
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:27,584
We both know you're trying
to cheat me here

101
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:29,715
so why don't you just admit it?

102
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,234
Dax.

103
00:07:45,273 --> 00:07:49,039
Did Sisko send you
to apologize for him?

104
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:50,667
No.

105
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:56,649
But he was concerned
about what happened.

106
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,450
l thought you might like
to talk about it.

107
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,820
There's nothing to talk about.

108
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,758
You can't really think
he tried to cheat you.

109
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:07,658
l knew you'd take his side.

110
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,220
l'm not taking anybody's side.

111
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:13,893
ln that case, l think
you should leave, Kira.

112
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:16,096
Dax.

113
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:19,868
l'm serious.
Leave.

114
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:25,578
Fine, l'll go.

115
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,706
Wait...

116
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:29,842
Get your hands off of me

117
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,081
before l do something
l'll regret.

118
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,452
That's the first smart
thing you've done

119
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:42,224
since you walked over here.

120
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:49,923
Oh!

121
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:53,197
Something wrong, Lieutenant?

122
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:56,702
No...

123
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:58,204
no.

124
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,317
How do you feel?

125
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,995
l feel like an idiot.

126
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,467
l'm so sorry about
all the horrible things

127
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,060
l said to you.

128
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:31,764
Don't worry about it.

129
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:33,899
They're already forgotten.

130
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:36,637
And l used to think
Curzon had a temper.

131
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,707
l don't know
what's wrong with me.

132
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:47,016
l feel like l have
so much anger inside

133
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:48,749
and l don't know
where it's coming from.

134
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:52,418
This masked figure in your...

135
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,257
Hallucinations.

136
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:57,423
Do you have the sense
of who it might have been?

137
00:10:57,465 --> 00:10:59,365
That's what's so strange.

138
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,564
He seems familiar, somehow,
but l don't know from where.

139
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:07,770
And the music.

140
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:10,641
Benjamin, l have to find out
what that music is.

141
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:11,667
Why don't you input

142
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,873
as much as you can
remember in the computer.

143
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:18,511
lt might be able to find a match
in the Federation database.

144
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,179
l'll do it...

145
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,883
Well, as soon as Julian
lets me leave here.

146
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:24,221
Jadzia...

147
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,719
have you experienced any
hallucinations prior to this?

148
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:32,528
Never, and l hope
l never do again.

149
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,033
lt was terrifying.

150
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,161
Have any of Dax's other hosts?

151
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:39,263
No, believe me, l'd remember.

152
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:40,535
Well...

153
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,905
according to your file

154
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:45,208
the only major trauma
the Dax symbiont ever suffered

155
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,579
was when Torias Dax was injured
in a shuttle accident.

156
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:49,742
Torias--

157
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:52,082
he was Dax's fifth host,
wasn't he?

158
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:53,847
Yes, right before Curzon.

159
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:58,086
lt says here that Torias
remained in a comatose state

160
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,956
for just under six months.

161
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:01,894
There must have been
a lot of tissue damage.

162
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,202
The doctors couldn't keep
his isoboramine levels up.

163
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:06,132
lsoboramine?

164
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,296
lt's a neurotransmitter

165
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:09,465
that mediates
the synaptic functions

166
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:12,442
between the host
and the symbiont.

167
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:15,412
When the levels dropped
to below 40 percent of normal

168
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:17,471
they had to remove the symbiont.

169
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:21,884
Sometimes the host is sacrificed
to save the symbiont.

170
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,410
Are you checking
my isoboramine levels?

171
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:25,752
Yes.

172
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,258
How low are they?

173
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:31,160
They've fallen
to 73 percent of normal.

174
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:33,720
Do you have any idea
what's causing it?

175
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:35,824
l'm not sure.

176
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:38,131
There's no tissue damage.

177
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:40,103
No synaptic degradation.

178
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:46,699
Julian... am l in danger
of rejecting my symbiont?

179
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:50,573
l wouldn't worry
about rejection just yet

180
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:54,051
but we do have to get
your isoboramine levels back up.

181
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,916
And l suggest we take her back

182
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:57,750
to the Trill homeworld,
and have the doctors

183
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:00,087
at the Symbiosis Commission
examine her.

184
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:10,964
Curzon always said

185
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:13,766
he wanted to show me
the Trill homeworld.

186
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:16,865
Looks like l'm going
to get there after all.

187
00:13:28,953 --> 00:13:30,921
How long before we reach Trill?

188
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:32,445
A little over 37 hours.

189
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,650
How's Dax?

190
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:35,420
Resting in her quarters.

191
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,984
Hmm.

192
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:38,586
lt's funny.

193
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:41,996
lt's been almost four years
since Curzon died

194
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,263
and l still miss the old man.

195
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:48,136
At first, l never thought
l'd ever get used to a new Dax

196
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:50,640
but if anything happens
to Jadzia...

197
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:52,199
l know.

198
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:54,567
l feel the same way.

199
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:58,480
We'll just have to make sure
nothing happens to her, right?

200
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:00,780
Right.

201
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:13,723
Yes?

202
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,995
Oh, good, l didn't wake you.

203
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:20,997
Not at all.

204
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,232
You having trouble sleeping?

205
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:25,265
Yeah, a little.

206
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:28,639
l could get you something.

207
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,907
No, thanks

208
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,915
but l could use some company...

209
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:33,439
if you're not too busy.

210
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:35,008
Oh, no, no,
l was just reading.

211
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:37,452
Oh, anything l'd be
interested in?

212
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,290
<i>Trill Physiology.</i>

213
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:43,418
Just some background research.

214
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:51,164
Look, um, Jadzia,
l know you're worried

215
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:53,534
but the doctors
at the Symbiosis Commission

216
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:55,835
know a lot more about this
than l do.

217
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:58,341
l can't believe
l'm going back there.

218
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:01,004
l spent three years
as a Trill initiate

219
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:05,709
and in all that time,
l hardly ever left the complex.

220
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,808
After l was joined

221
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:09,649
l swore l would never
step foot in there again.

222
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:12,155
Was it really that bad?

223
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:15,120
No.

224
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:18,993
What l remember is
the endless series of tests

225
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:20,496
they put me through.

226
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:22,726
Well, considering the risk
of rejection

227
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:24,234
you can't really blame them.

228
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:26,736
lf they would have put a
symbiont in an unsuitable host

229
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:28,762
they'd both be dead
within a matter of days.

230
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:31,901
That's true.

231
00:15:31,943 --> 00:15:36,175
l guess l had such
a difficult time, because...

232
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:39,843
l put so much pressure
on myself.

233
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:42,250
l wanted to be joined so badly.

234
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:43,981
Well, look on the bright side.

235
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:46,455
At least this time, you won't
be going there as an initiate.

236
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:47,458
No, l'm going there

237
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:51,451
as a patient,
and that's much worse.

238
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:55,023
l never told you this
before, Julian

239
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:57,033
but...

240
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:59,433
l've always been
afraid of doctors.

241
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,631
Most people are.

242
00:16:01,672 --> 00:16:03,537
When l was younger,
l was terrified of them.

243
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:04,939
Really?

244
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:06,534
Well, they seemed
to know everything.

245
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:07,544
lt was as if they held

246
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:09,443
the power of life and death
in their hands.

247
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,074
l used to think
that if l didn't behave

248
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:14,482
they'd make sure l got sick.

249
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,953
Then, as l got older,
l decided

250
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:20,116
that l wanted to know
what they knew--

251
00:16:20,157 --> 00:16:22,284
be as smart as they were.

252
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:24,794
And that's why you went
to medical school.

253
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:25,955
That's right.

254
00:16:25,997 --> 00:16:29,160
And you know
what l learned there?

255
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,761
That all l really wanted
to do was help people.

256
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:36,000
That's what doctors
are there for-- to help

257
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:39,907
so there's really no reason
to be afraid of them.

258
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:43,578
Now, if that little story

259
00:16:43,614 --> 00:16:47,482
didn't put you to sleep,
l don't know what will.

260
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:50,646
You're a very dear man, Julian.

261
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:55,715
Listen, Jadzia...

262
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,719
you are more than welcome to
stay the night here if you want.

263
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:01,527
You can have the top bunk.

264
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,869
Are you sure you don't mind?

265
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:07,131
Absolutely not.

266
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:08,331
Up you go.

267
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:13,334
Okay... well, in that case,
if it's not too much trouble

268
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:15,368
would you mind if l
took the lower bunk?

269
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:17,347
Curzon fell out
of a tree once and...

270
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,948
Whatever you want.

271
00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:21,815
Thank you.

272
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:43,296
ls this light
too bright for you?

273
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:47,340
Dax?

274
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:52,009
Sweet dreams.

275
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:04,294
After they finally finished
the neuro-response analysis

276
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:05,761
another doctor came in

277
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:08,094
and ran a cortical
protein series.

278
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:11,101
Did they do a bio-spectral scan
on the symbiont?

279
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:12,193
They had to make an incision

280
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:13,601
so they could
insert the scanner.

281
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:19,907
Jadzia, it's good
to see you again.

282
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:21,502
Dr. Renhol.

283
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:24,105
Everyone's very excited
about your being here, you know.

284
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:27,879
Jadzia is the only initiate
to ever successfully reapply

285
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:30,318
to the program
after being dropped.

286
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:31,912
You must be Dr. Bashir.

287
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:33,150
That's right.

288
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,249
Commander Benjamin Sisko.

289
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:36,657
Ah, yes,
Curzon's friend.

290
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:38,321
Yes, l had that privilege.

291
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:40,523
Did you get a chance to look
over the test results?

292
00:18:40,564 --> 00:18:41,690
Yes, l did.

293
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:45,293
As you noted, Doctor, her
isoboramine levels are low

294
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:48,533
so l put her on a benzocyatic
regimen to compensate.

295
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:51,200
As you can see, there's already
a three percent improvement.

296
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:55,144
Will l have to stay here for
the duration of the treatment?

297
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:57,238
No, Dr. Bashir
can administer it.

298
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:58,839
But l do want to see
you back here tomorrow

299
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:00,009
for a follow-up...

300
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:01,257
and for lunch.

301
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,687
l'd like that.

302
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,853
Well, if you'll excuse me,
l have an initiate

303
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,159
who needs some hand-holding.

304
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:19,774
l don't know
why we came back here

305
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:21,401
when l could be
taking you on a tour

306
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:22,638
of the Tenaran ice cliffs.

307
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:24,202
You're not taking us
anywhere, Dax.

308
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,146
You're going straight
to your quarters to rest.

309
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:27,149
But...

310
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:28,650
No buts.
Doctor's orders.

311
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:31,346
But l cannot sleep
in the afternoon.

312
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:35,346
Just lie down, close your eyes
and try not to think.

313
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:37,222
lt usually works for me.

314
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:07,848
Who are you?

315
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,155
lt's beautiful... isn't it?

316
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:25,965
Dax!

317
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:27,908
Jadzia!

318
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:55,704
l don't understand

319
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:57,433
why she'd have
another hallucination.

320
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:58,940
l've checked
her isoboramine levels.

321
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:00,373
They've risen
another six percent.

322
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:03,503
That's a larger increase
than l'd anticipated.

323
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:04,774
The suddenness could be

324
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:06,645
what triggered
the hallucination.

325
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,980
l want you
to begin administering

326
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:12,212
more frequent treatments
at a lower dosage.

327
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:13,448
Doctor...

328
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,154
the people who attacked me--

329
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,093
they were from
the Symbiosis Commission.

330
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:22,723
Hallucinations often take
the form of latent anxieties

331
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:24,426
and we all know the time
you spent here

332
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:25,991
wasn't that easy for you.

333
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,162
But the uniforms
they were wearing--

334
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,365
they were from
over 100 years ago.

335
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:33,136
That was long before
Jadzia was an initiate.

336
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:34,574
And none of my other hosts

337
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,544
had any bad memories
of being here.

338
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,911
Well, with seven lifetimes'
worth of memories

339
00:21:38,948 --> 00:21:41,974
it's no surprise things
would get a bit jumbled.

340
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:45,009
So you feel we're on the right
track with these treatments?

341
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,314
Yes, l do

342
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:48,880
but l still want
to see you tomorrow.

343
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:57,532
What's on your mind, Dax?

344
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,263
Oh! l wish l knew what
these hallucinations meant.

345
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,965
The computer's still trying
to identify the music.

346
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,563
Maybe that'll
tell us something.

347
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:06,870
l hope so.

348
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,604
Jadzia, um...

349
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:10,305
maybe you still have some issues

350
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:12,974
you need to sort out
about the time you spent here.

351
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:15,540
l don't need therapy, Julian.

352
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,279
l need answers.

353
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:20,311
Maybe the Guardians
could help me.

354
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:21,380
The Guardians?

355
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,186
They're unjoined Trill

356
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:25,853
who have devoted their lives
to the care of the symbionts.

357
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:28,125
They know more about them
than anyone.

358
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:53,110
So, this is where
the symbionts breed?

359
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:55,487
Mm-hmm. There are
interconnecting pools

360
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:56,923
throughout these caves.

361
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,756
They stretch back
for kilometers.

362
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,461
Look.

363
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:08,500
There's two of them
surfacing now.

364
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,408
What was that energy discharge?

365
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:17,708
That's how the symbionts
communicate with each other.

366
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:19,008
Fascinating.

367
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,785
That's one of the Guardians.

368
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,560
Don't be surprised
if he seems a little distracted.

369
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,591
They're not used to visitors.

370
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,500
Hmm, that explain things.

371
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,169
Can l ask what you're doing?

372
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:50,438
Yes.

373
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,709
What are you doing?

374
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,016
Oh, just making sure
they're comfortable.

375
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:05,289
Checking the ion concentration,
temperature, viscosity...

376
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:10,492
They get very cranky
if everything's not perfect.

377
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,433
You don't want them cranky.

378
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:15,960
Oh, no, huh... of course not.

379
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:18,403
They can be very demanding.

380
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:22,535
Sometimes...

381
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:25,138
l don't know
why l put up with it.

382
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,285
What's the weather like outside?

383
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,912
Well, it's sunny, very pleasant.

384
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:34,445
Ah, sunshine.

385
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,458
l miss sunshine.

386
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:41,387
You're Dax.

387
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:43,889
Yes.

388
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:44,990
Jadzia Dax.

389
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:46,797
How did you know?

390
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:54,806
l know.

391
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,837
Something's wrong.

392
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:00,242
Yes.

393
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,613
Do you mind?

394
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,953
Oh...

395
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:11,823
Oh, that is not good.

396
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,919
Not good at all.

397
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:15,452
Tell me

398
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,226
how bad are the dreams?

399
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,927
They're not dreams.

400
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,958
They're hallucinations.

401
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,198
Actually, they're memories.

402
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,707
Then why don't l remember them?

403
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:29,972
The balance is off.

404
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,673
You mean the balance
between host and symbiont.

405
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:35,912
What other balance is there?

406
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,545
Someone's not playing fair.

407
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:42,353
lt wouldn't be Dax,
so it must be the host.

408
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:45,519
You're saying the problem
is with Jadzia?

409
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:46,994
No, no, not necessarily.

410
00:25:47,096 --> 00:25:49,030
Could be any one of the hosts.

411
00:25:50,432 --> 00:25:52,332
All right, Dax.

412
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:53,994
Come with me.

413
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:56,435
Let's see what we find.

414
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:11,777
How'd it go?

415
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,083
Timor is convinced

416
00:26:13,122 --> 00:26:14,919
that my hallucinations
have something to do

417
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:16,550
with one of my previous hosts.

418
00:26:16,593 --> 00:26:18,458
But he's not sure which one

419
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,021
so he wants me to come back
again tomorrow to see him.

420
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:23,498
We've got some good news.

421
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:25,933
The computer's identified
your music.

422
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,629
Can l hear it?

423
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:34,937
That's it.

424
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:36,377
The piece was written

425
00:26:36,412 --> 00:26:39,142
by a Trill named Joran Belar
86 years ago.

426
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:41,275
Does the name sound familiar?

427
00:26:41,317 --> 00:26:44,252
Joran Belar?

428
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:45,948
l don't think so.

429
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:47,786
ls there a picture of him?

430
00:26:47,824 --> 00:26:49,223
l'll see.

431
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,285
He left me no choice.

432
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:27,921
Who are you?!

433
00:27:43,146 --> 00:27:44,579
Dax?

434
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,477
Dax!

435
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:54,251
She's in neural shock.

436
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:09,462
We have to stabilize
her synaptic functions.

437
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:11,268
Activate the neural
induction field.

438
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:17,043
Give her another two cc's
of benzocyatizine.

439
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,104
Doctor...

440
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:21,014
Her isoboramine levels
are down to 51 percent.

441
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,211
l don't understand it,
a decrease that severe

442
00:28:23,252 --> 00:28:25,345
is usually the result
of tissue damage.

443
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:28,152
Commander, this wormhole
you've discovered--

444
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:30,216
have your people
done any surveys

445
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:32,284
of the diametric fields
it generates?

446
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:35,422
Yes, in fact, Dax did the
most recent survey herself.

447
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:36,830
l'd like to see those reports.

448
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:38,561
Do you think
there's any correlation

449
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:40,592
between Dax's condition
and the wormhole?

450
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,161
Something unusual is affecting
her, and at this point

451
00:28:43,206 --> 00:28:45,902
we can't afford
to rule anything out.

452
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:48,502
lf we can't get her
isoboramine readings

453
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:51,104
up to an acceptable level
within 48 hours

454
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:54,048
l'm afraid we'll have
to remove the symbiont.

455
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,710
But that will kill Jadzia!

456
00:28:55,752 --> 00:28:57,413
l'm well aware
of that, Commander

457
00:28:57,453 --> 00:29:00,445
but Jadzia would be
the first to tell you

458
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,893
that our primary responsibility
must be to the symbiont.

459
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:07,896
lf there's any change
in her condition

460
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,158
l'll let you know.

461
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:14,900
Timor, we need your help.

462
00:29:14,971 --> 00:29:16,632
Dax has gone
into neural shock.

463
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,299
l'm sorry to hear that.

464
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:19,865
The doctors at the
Symbiosis Commission

465
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:21,035
don't know what's causing it.

466
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:22,101
You told Jadzia

467
00:29:22,145 --> 00:29:24,238
that her condition
had something to do

468
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,373
with one of Dax's
previous hosts.

469
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:29,213
That was just speculation.

470
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:31,914
You told her
you were certain of it.

471
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,751
lf l gave that impression,
l apologize.

472
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,282
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me

473
00:29:37,326 --> 00:29:38,918
the symbionts need me.

474
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:41,088
Jadzia needs you, too.

475
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,119
She's dying!

476
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:44,190
All we're asking
is that you come

477
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:45,894
with us to the
Symbiosis Commission

478
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:47,698
and consult with Dr. Renhol.

479
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:50,262
l'm sorry, there's
nothing l can do.

480
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:52,900
How do you know that
unless you try?

481
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:54,933
Timor, what's going on here?

482
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:58,104
Did someone tell you
not to pursue this?

483
00:29:58,147 --> 00:29:59,808
Why would anyone do that?

484
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:02,283
You tell me.

485
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:04,878
l hope your friend recovers.

486
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:06,718
l truly do.

487
00:30:06,756 --> 00:30:10,852
Now, if that's all,
l'm very busy.

488
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:13,088
He's not busy, he's scared.

489
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:16,394
Why would anyone want
to keep him quiet about this?

490
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:17,831
What are they trying to hide?

491
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:18,856
Yesterday, Timor claimed

492
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,062
the problem was with one
of Dax's previous hosts.

493
00:30:21,103 --> 00:30:23,230
Today, the mere mention
of the possibility

494
00:30:23,272 --> 00:30:24,296
makes him nervous.

495
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,932
You'd think that
someone doesn't want

496
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:27,602
an investigation of
those past hosts.

497
00:30:27,643 --> 00:30:30,373
l can't think of a better reason
for such an investigation.

498
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,380
Can you?

499
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:34,076
lt's possible
that one of the Dax hosts

500
00:30:34,116 --> 00:30:37,210
had something to do
with this composer Belar.

501
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,414
Well, Jadzia seemed
to lose consciousness

502
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:41,616
the minute she saw
Belar's picture.

503
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:44,023
l think it's time we
found out more about him.

504
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,830
l've accessed the Trill
central database.

505
00:30:56,873 --> 00:31:00,172
Let's see what information
there is on Joran Belar.

506
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,772
Here we are.

507
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:05,804
Born on Stardate 1024.7

508
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:08,646
Died on Stardate 8615.2.

509
00:31:08,684 --> 00:31:10,709
ls that all there is?

510
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:12,448
Well, l was expecting
a lot more.

511
00:31:12,488 --> 00:31:13,819
When l looked through
Dax's records

512
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:16,324
there was detailed
information on each host.

513
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,190
Could the file have been purged?

514
00:31:18,227 --> 00:31:20,354
lf part of the file's
been deleted

515
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:22,864
the data compression
ratio might be off.

516
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:24,059
Yeah, look at this.

517
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,466
The ratio's for a file
five times larger.

518
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:28,367
There was definitely
more information here.

519
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:29,894
Call up Dax's records.

520
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:32,373
Put them side by side
with Joran's.

521
00:31:37,013 --> 00:31:38,446
Wait a minute.

522
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:39,539
Look at these dates.

523
00:31:39,582 --> 00:31:43,814
Belar died on the same day
as Torias Dax died.

524
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:47,186
The same day the Dax symbiont
was put into Curzon.

525
00:31:47,223 --> 00:31:49,851
Oh, this has to be more
than a coincidence.

526
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,328
Whoever purged the main database
might have missed something.

527
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,901
Check the enrollment records
of all the Trill music academies

528
00:32:00,937 --> 00:32:02,564
during Belar's lifetime.

529
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:05,738
He's not listed.

530
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:07,936
But there is someone here
with the same last name.

531
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:09,164
Maybe they're related.

532
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:10,696
Yolad Belar.

533
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:12,723
Check the central database.

534
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,598
See if he's still alive.

535
00:32:16,838 --> 00:32:18,362
He is.

536
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:20,033
Access the Trill
communications grid.

537
00:32:20,075 --> 00:32:21,064
Try to locate him.

538
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:25,546
There's a reasonable chance
that he and Joran were related.

539
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,571
Musical ability
often runs in families.

540
00:32:29,484 --> 00:32:30,951
l've established a com link.

541
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:33,179
Put him on the main viewer.

542
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:40,093
Yes, can l help you?

543
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:41,789
l'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

544
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,355
of the Federation Starbase
Deep Space 9.

545
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,530
What would a Starfleet
officer want with me?

546
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:51,402
Are you Yolad Belar?

547
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:53,498
l am. Why?

548
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:56,635
We're trying to find information
on a man named Joran Belar.

549
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:57,906
Do you know him?

550
00:32:57,946 --> 00:33:01,074
Of course l did.
He was my brother.

551
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:04,282
He was a composer?

552
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,513
That's right.

553
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:07,885
We both graduated
from the same music academy.

554
00:33:07,922 --> 00:33:09,412
Are you aware that his record

555
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:12,153
has been purged from
the academy's files?

556
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:14,923
That doesn't make any sense.

557
00:33:14,963 --> 00:33:17,124
What's this all about?

558
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:19,463
That's what we're trying
to find out.

559
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:22,561
Do you know if your brother
knew a joined Trill

560
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:24,196
named Torias Dax?

561
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:28,437
My brother died 85 years ago.

562
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:31,138
l, l have a hard time
remembering

563
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:33,204
what happened yesterday.

564
00:33:33,248 --> 00:33:35,148
Then you don't remember
the name?

565
00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:36,411
No.

566
00:33:36,451 --> 00:33:40,148
But that doesn't mean
Joran didn't know him.

567
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:42,053
You say he was joined.

568
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,717
They could have met

569
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:47,717
when my brother went off
to become an initiate.

570
00:33:47,762 --> 00:33:49,662
He was a candidate for joining?

571
00:33:49,698 --> 00:33:52,496
That's what l just said,
isn't it?

572
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:54,229
Was he given a symbiont?

573
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:57,966
Not according
to the Symbiosis Commission.

574
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:01,304
They claim he was dropped
from the program

575
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:03,072
after the second year.

576
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:06,308
According to them,
he murdered the doctor

577
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:08,908
that recommended dropping him

578
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:12,386
and was killed trying
to escape the murder scene.

579
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,446
Sounds like you're not convinced
that's what really happened.

580
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:19,859
Oh, l believe
he killed that doctor.

581
00:34:19,894 --> 00:34:23,921
My brother
had a violent temper.

582
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:28,095
But about six months
before that happened

583
00:34:28,136 --> 00:34:30,604
my brother contacted me.

584
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,539
He sounded different somehow

585
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:37,511
more confident,
even colder than usual

586
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:41,345
and when l asked him
about it, he laughed.

587
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:46,286
He said he was different,
that he'd been joined.

588
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:48,687
Did he tell you the name
of his symbiont?

589
00:34:48,723 --> 00:34:49,883
Hmm...

590
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:51,391
maybe he did.

591
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:56,227
l was so surprised to learn
he'd been chosen to be joined

592
00:34:56,264 --> 00:34:58,698
l can't remember much else.

593
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:01,031
l loved my brother, Commander.

594
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:06,029
ln spite of all the things
he did, l loved him.

595
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:10,837
Thank you for taking the time
to speak with us.

596
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:15,441
Doctor, call up Dax's records.

597
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:17,917
l think l'm beginning
to understand

598
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:19,510
what's going on here.

599
00:35:27,362 --> 00:35:29,853
According
to the official records

600
00:35:29,898 --> 00:35:34,232
after Torias died, the Dax
symbiont was put into Curzon.

601
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:36,794
What if that's not
what happened?

602
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:40,638
What if Dax was given
another host before Curzon--

603
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:43,940
a host who should never
have been given a symbiont?

604
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:47,413
A host named Joran Belar.

605
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:01,422
Her isoboramine levels
have dropped to 44 percent.

606
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:04,899
Tell Dr. Torvin to prepare
the new host for surgery.

607
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:08,265
We'll begin transferring
the symbiont in 15 minutes.

608
00:36:08,303 --> 00:36:11,466
Tell Doctor Torvin
to get a cup of <i>raktajino.</i>

609
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:12,734
He won't be needed.

610
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:14,401
Commander Sisko, how dare you
come in here and...

611
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:15,409
lt's over, Doctor.

612
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:17,172
We know about Joran Belar.

613
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:19,371
Wait outside.

614
00:36:19,414 --> 00:36:21,439
Tell the surgeons to stand by.

615
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:25,449
l don't have time for this,
Commander.

616
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:27,250
The symbiont is in danger.

617
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:28,346
So is Jadzia.

618
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:31,290
l can't do anything for her.

619
00:36:31,326 --> 00:36:33,920
Can't or won't?

620
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:36,394
l resent that implication.

621
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:38,422
And l resent having
to watch my friend die

622
00:36:38,466 --> 00:36:40,661
just so you can protect
your secret.

623
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:41,828
What secret?

624
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,838
Oh, l think you know.

625
00:36:43,872 --> 00:36:45,601
And the thought of it
becoming public

626
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,937
scares the hell out of you.

627
00:36:46,975 --> 00:36:48,943
Commander, l don't know
what you're talking about.

628
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,034
l'm talking about the fact

629
00:36:50,078 --> 00:36:52,239
that, 86 years ago,
the Symbiosis Commission

630
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,477
mistakenly gave the Dax
symbiont to Joran Belar.

631
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:58,042
l don't recall
ever seeing any mention

632
00:36:58,086 --> 00:37:00,179
of a Joran Dax on our records.

633
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:01,449
And we both know why, Doctor.

634
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:04,652
The Symbiosis Commission
altered the records

635
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:05,784
just like they tried

636
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:08,295
to erase all knowledge
of Joran from Dax's memory.

637
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:09,728
And now, after 80 years

638
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:11,789
the memory block
is deteriorating

639
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:14,825
and Dax is starting to
remember the Joran host.

640
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:17,360
What possible reason
would anyone have

641
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:20,169
to create that sort
of elaborate cover-up?

642
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,903
We wondered about that, too.

643
00:37:21,943 --> 00:37:23,410
What was it about Joran

644
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:25,639
that had to be hidden
at all costs?

645
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,170
The fact that he never

646
00:37:27,215 --> 00:37:30,048
should have been selected
as a host? No.

647
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:33,110
That simple error in judgment
wouldn't be enough, would it?

648
00:37:33,154 --> 00:37:34,678
There had to be something more.

649
00:37:34,722 --> 00:37:36,212
Something that would shake

650
00:37:36,257 --> 00:37:38,384
the very foundation
of your society.

651
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:40,553
Tell me, Doctor,
how many of your people

652
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,358
are suitable for joining?

653
00:37:42,397 --> 00:37:44,524
l don't see how that's relevant.

654
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:47,034
l understand
the percentage is very low--

655
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:48,899
maybe one in a thousand?

656
00:37:48,937 --> 00:37:50,029
That's right.

657
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:51,766
Which is why the candidates

658
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:53,831
are put through
such rigorous testing.

659
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,070
That's how we make sure
the symbionts

660
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,203
aren't given
to an unsuitable host.

661
00:37:58,246 --> 00:38:00,476
What would happen,
if, for some reason

662
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:02,642
a symbiont was given
to an unsuitable host?

663
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:06,076
That doesn't happen.

664
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,348
What if it did?

665
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:08,878
Rejection would set in.

666
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,754
The host and the symbiont
would both die.

667
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:13,727
How long before rejection
would set in?

668
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:16,897
Three, maybe four days.

669
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:18,728
Then someone like Joran Belar

670
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:21,701
an unstable personality
with violent tendencies

671
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:24,398
should have rejected a symbiont
within a matter of days.

672
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,906
Yet that didn't happen, did it?

673
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:27,406
According to our information

674
00:38:27,442 --> 00:38:29,137
he was joined
to the Dax symbiont

675
00:38:29,177 --> 00:38:30,542
for six months.

676
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:34,173
Six months, Doctor.

677
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:35,807
lf a man like Joran Belar

678
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,375
can be joined successfully
for that long

679
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:40,853
how many others
can be joined as well?

680
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:43,880
Hundreds? Thousands?

681
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:45,893
Certainly more
than the Symbiosis Commission

682
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:47,326
would have us believe

683
00:38:47,362 --> 00:38:48,920
and that is what
you've been trying

684
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,520
to cover up all along,
isn't it?

685
00:38:50,565 --> 00:38:53,796
That's why you're willing
to let Jadzia die!

686
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:02,838
l'm not interested in exposing
your secret, Doctor.

687
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:06,870
All l care about is Jadzia.

688
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:10,816
And l promise you, if she dies

689
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:14,753
l'll see to it that
the entire planet knows why.

690
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:22,855
Do you realize what would happen
if you did that?

691
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,759
lt would mean chaos.

692
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,856
There aren't enough symbionts
for that many hosts.

693
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,127
The potential danger

694
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,601
to the symbionts
would be enormous.

695
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:35,163
They would become commodities
to be purchased

696
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,074
or prizes to be fought over.

697
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:42,546
Nearly half our population
is capable of being joined.

698
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:49,343
That's what we learned
from our unfortunate experience

699
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,355
with Joran Dax.

700
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:58,755
Now do you understand why you
must not reveal the truth?

701
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:01,823
Do you understand my terms?

702
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:04,267
lt's not that simple.

703
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:05,701
For Jadzia to survive

704
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,706
we have to stabilize
the synaptic functions

705
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,901
between the host and symbiont.

706
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:14,240
Joran's memories have
to be allowed to surface

707
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:17,112
to reintegrate with
Dax's other memories.

708
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,013
lt could be very dangerous.

709
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,540
Jadzia is a strong woman.

710
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,450
l say we give her that chance.

711
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:24,114
What if you're wrong?

712
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:28,353
What if Joran's personality
overwhelms Jadzia?

713
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,623
Are you willing to risk that?

714
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:34,189
The point is it's not up
to me or you to decide.

715
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:37,099
lt's her life
and her decision.

716
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,820
Julian.

717
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:02,185
We've got a lot to
talk about, Jadzia.

718
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:04,889
You have a decision to make.

719
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,657
Joran.

720
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,892
You know who l am.

721
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:17,959
You're a part of me.

722
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,713
Come in.

723
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,363
Checking up on me, Benjamin?

724
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:22,457
Just thought l'd see
how you were doing.

725
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:29,798
Julian stopped by 15 minutes ago
and said the same thing.

726
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,903
l'll be all right.

727
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:37,379
l just need some time
to sort things out.

728
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:39,610
l suppose it would
have been easier

729
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:42,017
if you'd never
found out about Joran.

730
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:45,022
No, l'm glad l did.

731
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:47,081
lf you want to know
who you are

732
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,958
it's important to know
who you've been.

733
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:53,988
Good night, old man.

734
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,362
Benjamin.

735
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:04,471
l'll see you in the morning.
