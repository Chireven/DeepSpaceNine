# Star Trek : Deep Space Nine
Deep Space Nine is loved by many people.  Unfortunately, we will most likely never see a studio release of Deep Space Nine in HD.  I want to see it in something better than what is available.  Online streaming services have SD copies with flaws... it can be better.

After lots of research, I see this is a project that many people have started but never finished.  Its my goal to create a repository of scripts and tools that you can use to do this yourself.  


Special thanks for the folks over at doom9 -- 
Without the patience of Stereodude and bladerunner1982, this wouldn't be possible!

# NOTE : 
There are lots of empty files in this repository.  If you're going to use one of the ovr files, please make sure it has data in it before you use it.  This project is NOT complete yet!
