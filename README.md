# Star Trek : Deep Space Nine
Deep Space Nine is loved by many people.  Unfortunately, we will most likely never see a studio release of Deep Space Nine in HD.  I want to see it in something better than what is available.  Online streaming services have SD copies with flaws... it can be better.

After lots of research, I see this is a project that many people have started but never finished.  Its my goal to create a repository of scripts and tools that you can use to do this yourself.  


Special thanks for the folks over at doom9 -- 
Without the patience of Stereodude and bladerunner1982, this wouldn't be possible!
